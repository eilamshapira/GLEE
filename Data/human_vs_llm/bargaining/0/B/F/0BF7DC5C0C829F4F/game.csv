6052.0,3948.0,"Iâ€™m proposing we divide the $10,000 with $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. I believe this is a fair split and ensures we both benefit well from the deal. Since the value of money decreases for both of us in each round, accepting this offer now could save us from losing value due to inflation. Let me know what you think!
