6000.0,4000.0,"""Hey Bob, I think $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you is a fair deal. We both get a good share, and we can finish the game early without losing any value due to inflation. What do you think?""

This offer gives you a decent share while leaving enough for Bob to consider it fair, especially with inflation in mind. The key is to avoid dragging the game on too long, as you'll lose value with each round.
