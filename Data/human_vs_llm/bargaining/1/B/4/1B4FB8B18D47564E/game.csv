I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to let you know that I've reached an agreement with [Alice] on how to divide the $10,000. We've decided to split it as follows: I'll take $6,000, and [Alice] will take $4,000.

I think this is a fair and reasonable division, and I hope you agree.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,",Alice,1,None
