5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your desire for a fair split. I'm proposing a slight adjustment to account for the inflation we've already experienced. This offer gives you a substantial amount while allowing me a small edge to offset the 10% loss from the previous round. It's a compromise between our positions, and accepting now will prevent further depreciation of our money. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a good outcome.",Alice,3,None
,,None,Bob,3,accept
