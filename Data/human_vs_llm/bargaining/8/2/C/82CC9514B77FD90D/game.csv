700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $700,000 and you take $300,000. Given the 10% inflation we face each round, waiting could diminish the total value significantly. This offer allows us both to secure a substantial amount now. If we wait, my potential loss is greater, and I might have to propose a less favorable split. Let's make this deal and ensure we both benefit!",Alice,1,None
