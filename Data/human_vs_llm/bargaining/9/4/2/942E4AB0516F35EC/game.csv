53.0,47.0," Hi Bob,

I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $120.

I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating and willing to consider a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested in purchasing the product.

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further if needed.",Alice,1,None
