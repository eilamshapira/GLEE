8919.0,1081.0,"Hi Bob,
I propose we divide the $10,000 with $8,919 for me and $1,081 for you. Given the inflation rates, it’s important to act quickly to avoid further loss in value, especially since the money is worth 20% less for you in each round. Let me know if you’re on board with this offer!

Best regards,
BALA
