55.0,45.0," Hi Bob,

I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $120.

I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating and willing to consider a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested in purchasing the product.

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further if needed.",Alice,1,None

60.0,40.0,"John, I appreciate the offer but I think it's a bit skewed in your favor. I'm offering you $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a fairer split, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",Bob,2,None
