8393.0,1607.0,"Hi Bob,
I propose we split the $10,000 with $8,393 for me and $1,607 for you. Considering the inflation rates, this offer allows us both to secure a better value now rather than waiting for future rounds, where the money will lose more value. Let me know what you think!

Best regards,
