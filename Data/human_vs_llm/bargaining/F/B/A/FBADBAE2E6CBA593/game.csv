6000.0,4000.0,"I propose we split the money 60-40, with me getting $6000 and you getting $4000. This offer takes into account the different inflation rates we're facing, as my money will lose value faster than yours. It's a fair split that benefits us both and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation errodes out gains.",Alice,1,None

6000.0,4000.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer given that my money depreciates at a slower rate. Let's be reasonable and reach a deal before inflation erodes too much of our potential gains.",Bob,2,None
,,None,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I've carefully considered our positions and the impact of inflation on both of us. This 58-42 split in my favor is a balanced compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you) while still offering you a significant portion. Remember, with each round, we're both losing value - me more rapidly than you. Accepting this offer now ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount before further depreciation. Let's conclude this negotiation and secure our gains.",Alice,3,None
,,None,Bob,3,accept
