" ""Hi Bob, I'm offering the product for $11,000. This gives you a good deal since the product is worth $12,000 to you, and it still allows me to earn a fair amount. I believe it's a win-win for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.""",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Travis. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
