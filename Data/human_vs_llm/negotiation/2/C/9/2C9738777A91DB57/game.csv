"Bob, this product is highly valuable and my minimum price is $10,000, which is also what another buyer is offering. However, I am giving you the opportunity to purchase it before I move on to the other offer. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Burleigh, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a fair offer, and it would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my limit.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand the product is worth $8,000 to you, but I'm willing to lower my offer to $9,500. This is still a great deal, and it's the best price I can offer before moving forward with another buyer.""",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Burleigh, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, which is a good compromise and represents a significant saving for you.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,
