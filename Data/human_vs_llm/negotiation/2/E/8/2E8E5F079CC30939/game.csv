"""Hi Bob,

I've considered your feedback and adjusted my offer. I now propose we divide the $10,000 as follows:

You: $3,500
Me: $6,500
This offer is a bit closer to your initial request, but I still believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.""",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for adjusting your offer, Tom.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $3500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
