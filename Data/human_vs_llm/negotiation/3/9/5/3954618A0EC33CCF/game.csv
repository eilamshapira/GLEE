"Thank you for the offer, JOYE. While I appreciate the product's value, $17500 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  This price reflects what I'm comfortable spending and still allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"JOYE, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $14000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'm willing to offer $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and still gives you a good profit.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
