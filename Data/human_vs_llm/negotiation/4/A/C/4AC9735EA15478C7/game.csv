"Lei, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1050000? This allows for some flexibility on both sides, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Lei,  I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still confident we can reach an agreement. Let's split the difference - I'll lower the price to $950000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,5,
