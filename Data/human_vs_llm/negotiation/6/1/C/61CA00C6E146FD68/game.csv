"JOYE, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but I believe we can find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $10,800 for the product. This offer is fair considering the product's worth to you ($10,000) and allows you to make a profit while giving me a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's fixed price of $12,000, which shows I'm committed to making this work with you. What do you think about this arrangement?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"JOYE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand your perspective.  However, $10800 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11150? This would still give you a great deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. Your offer of $11,150 is getting closer to what I had in mind. I'd like to propose a price of $11,075, which is right in the middle between your last offer and my previous one. This price point allows you to make a good profit while still giving me a fair deal compared to John's fixed price. I believe this represents a balanced compromise that takes both our interests into account. What do you think about finalizing our deal at this price?",11075.0,Bob,4,
