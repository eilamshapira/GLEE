"Dear Alice,

Thank you for your offer to divide the $10,000. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe it does not fully reflect the value I've contributed to the project.

I propose a counteroffer:

I will take $7,000.
You will take $3,000.
This revised allocation more accurately reflects my contributions and ensures a fair distribution of the funds. I believe it is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.

Please let me know if you are willing to consider my counteroffer. I am open to further discussion if necessary.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Walls, I understand your perspective, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9000 for this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
