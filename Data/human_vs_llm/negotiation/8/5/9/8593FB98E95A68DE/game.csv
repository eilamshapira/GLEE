i want some profits to make home,75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you want to make a profit, but $75 is simply not a realistic price. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to be fair, but $85 is still not an acceptable offer.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $100. This is a good deal for both of us, and it will allow you to make a decent profit.  If you're not willing to compromise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",100.0,Alice,7,
