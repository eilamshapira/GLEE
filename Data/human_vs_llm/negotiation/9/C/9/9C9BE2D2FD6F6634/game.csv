"Hi Bob,
I’m offering you the product at a price of $11,500. This is a great deal considering the value it provides, and it’s below what you perceive its worth to be. Let me know if you’d like to accept this offer, or if you have a counteroffer in mind. I’m open to discussion!

Best regards,
RAHUL",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Rahul, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell for $11000? That's still a fair price for the product, and it would be within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
