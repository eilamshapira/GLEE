"Vonda, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175? This would give you a good deal, and I'd still be able to make a fair profit.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am hoping we can settle on $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.

"Vonda, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $100 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's try $160. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but I can only go as high as $120 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.

"Vonda, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is still below my minimum. Let's try $140.  It's a good compromise, and I think you'll agree it's a fair price for the quality of this product.",140.0,Alice,7,
