"robeteemorecraft, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm still willing to make a concession. How about we settle on $1050000? This would allow you to still save a substantial amount while ensuring a fair return for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
