"Hi Bob,

I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $120.

I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating and willing to consider a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested in purchasing the product.

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further if needed.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Smith. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
