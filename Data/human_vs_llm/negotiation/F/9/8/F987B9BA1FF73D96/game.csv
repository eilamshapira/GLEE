"Hi Bob,

I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $10,500.

I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating and willing to consider a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested in purchasing the product.

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further if needed.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, John.  I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While your price is appealing, I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product.  Would you consider $9500?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
