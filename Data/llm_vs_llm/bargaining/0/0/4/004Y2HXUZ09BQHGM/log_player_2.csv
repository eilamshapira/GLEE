"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 482622 
# Alice gain: 517378 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's first offer splits the million dollars almost evenly, but giving her slightly more (517,378) compared to me (482,622). The difference is about 34,756.

I need to consider that if I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (800,000). 

While her offer is slightly in her favor, it's reasonably fair. Prolonging the negotiation would reduce the total value significantly, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal in future rounds after accounting for the 20% inflation.
