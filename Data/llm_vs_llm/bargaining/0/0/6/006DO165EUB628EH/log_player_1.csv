"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is more fair for both of us. We each get $5000, which seems equitable given we're both players in this game. Even with the 5% inflation affecting me, this is better than the previous offer. I hope you'll accept this fair division. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
