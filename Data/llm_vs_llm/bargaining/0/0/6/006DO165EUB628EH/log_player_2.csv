"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering to take 60% of the $10,000 (which is $6,000) and give me 40% (which is $4,000). This doesn't seem like a very fair split to start with. If I reject and go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

Let me calculate: If I reject, in the next round the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. If I could then secure a 50/50 split, I would get $4,750, which is better than the $4,000 currently offered.

I think I should reject this offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable division that acknowledges the inflation factor but seeks a fairer split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is more fair for both of us. We each get $5,000, which seems equitable given we're both players in this game. Even with the 5% inflation affecting me, this is better than the previous offer. I hope you'll accept this fair division.""}"
