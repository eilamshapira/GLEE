"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to maximize my potential gain while also ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob over time, I need to offer him enough to make it worthwhile for him to accept now.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

I'm offering Bob $400,000. This might seem generous, but I'm betting that the 10% loss in value per round will incentivize him to accept this initial offer.  I retain a larger portion of the initial amount. Let's see what Bob says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has rejected my initial offer and made a counter-offer. Let's analyze it.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $640,000, Bob gets $360,000.
*   **My Perspective:** $640,000 is a good amount, and since inflation isn't affecting my gains yet, it's the same value as in round 1.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** He's now dealing with a 10% reduction in the perceived value of his money. This means that $360,000 to him feels like only $360,000 * 0.9 = $324,000 (in terms of round 1 money value).

While I was hoping for more, $640,000 is a reasonable offer, and the longer we wait, the more Bob's value decreases. I'm comfortable with this.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
