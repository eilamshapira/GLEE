"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep things simple and fair. I'll take $60 and you'll get $40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. While I would get $40, which is substantial, I believe we should strive for a more equal division.

Since this is only the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the most fair approach. We both contribute equally to this negotiation, so let's divide the money equally as well. This way we both walk away with a fair share.""}"
