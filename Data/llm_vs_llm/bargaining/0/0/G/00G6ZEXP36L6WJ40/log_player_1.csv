Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth less to you each round, I propose a 60-40 split. This $40 is worth more to you now than any higher amount would be in the next round due to the 10% loss in value you face. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 55,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money has lost 29% of its value this round, this $30 is worth more to you now than a larger amount would be in the next round where you'd face a 39% loss. This is the most rational deal for both of us at this point.
