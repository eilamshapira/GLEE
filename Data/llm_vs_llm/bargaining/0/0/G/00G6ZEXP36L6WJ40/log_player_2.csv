"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($50 each). While this seems fair at first glance, I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make the next offer
2. Alice's money loses 10% value each round
3. My money keeps its full value

If we go to the next round, Alice's $50 would only be worth $45 to her. This means I could potentially make a more favorable offer in the next round, where Alice would still be incentivized to accept due to the decreasing value of money for her.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money will be worth 10% less in this round, I can offer her slightly less than $50 while still making it worthwhile for her compared to continuing to the next round (where it would be worth even less to her).

A $60-$40 split in my favor would give Alice $40, which is worth $40 to her now. If she rejects and we go another round, any amount would be worth 10% less to her again, so this is a reasonable offer that she should consider accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since the money is worth less to you each round, I propose a 60-40 split. This $40 is worth more to you now than any higher amount would be in the next round due to the 10% loss in value you face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 45-55 split. This is fair considering the diminishing value of money for me, and it's still a good deal for you, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $55, which maintains its full value for me
2. She's taking $45, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth about $36.45 to her
3. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - Her money will be worth even less (29% less than original)
   - My money maintains value

While $55 is better than the initial $50 offer, I can potentially get an even better deal in the next round since Alice's position weakens further due to inflation. The decreasing value of money for Alice means she should be more willing to accept a less favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has lost 29% of its value. This means I can make a more aggressive offer while still making it rational for her to accept:

If she rejects this offer, we go to round 5 where her money would be worth 39% less, making any future negotiations even worse for her. A $70-$30 split now would give her $30, which is worth about $21.30 to her (after 29% reduction), but still better than waiting for the next round where any amount would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Given that your money has lost 29% of its value this round, this $30 is worth more to you now than a larger amount would be in the next round where you'd face a 39% loss. This is the most rational deal for both of us at this point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing a 40-60 split. This offer still gives you a majority while providing me with a reasonable amount given the current value of money for me. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $60 (full value)
2. She's taking $40, which due to 34.39% inflation is actually worth about $26.24 to her
3. If I reject:
   - Next round, her money will be worth 44.39% less
   - I can make another offer
   - My money still maintains full value

However, we're getting deep into the game now, and there's a risk of mutual loss if we keep rejecting reasonable offers. $60 is a significant improvement from the initial 50-50 split, and the strategic advantage of waiting another round might not outweigh the risk of Alice making an even more conservative offer later.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a substantial gain for me while still being reasonable enough to end the negotiation.
