500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you at 10% per round, this is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would lose value. This gives us both equal amounts and we can both walk away happy.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that inflation is significantly impacting your gains - another round would mean your money loses even more value (over 27% already). This offer gives you $450000 now, which is better than risking further depreciation. Let's conclude our negotiation with this fair compromise given the inflation dynamics.",Bob,4,
