"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you at 10% per round, this is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would lose value. This gives us both equal amounts and we can both walk away happy.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that inflation is significantly impacting your gains - another round would mean your money loses even more value (over 27% already). This offer gives you $450000 now, which is better than risking further depreciation. Let's conclude our negotiation with this fair compromise given the inflation dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
