"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000. 

Given that inflation affects Alice (10% less value each round) but doesn't affect me (0%), I have a strategic advantage in rejecting and making my own proposal next round. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth the same to me, but worth 10% less to Alice.

Since I can make a more favorable proposal in the next round, and Alice will be under more pressure to accept due to inflation on her side, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that accounts for the inflation impact on Alice's side.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you at 10% per round, this is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would lose value. This gives us both equal amounts and we can both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer where I would get $450,000 and she would get $550,000.

Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), the $450,000 is worth the full amount to me. For Alice, due to 19% inflation since the first round, her $550,000 is effectively worth about $445,500 in round 1 terms.

This is a better offer than her first one, but I still have a strategic advantage because of the inflation asymmetry. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth 27.1% less than round 1 (compounding 10% inflation), putting her under more pressure.

I believe I can get a more favorable split by rejecting and making my own counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that inflation is significantly impacting your gains - another round would mean your money loses even more value (over 27% already). This offer gives you $450,000 now, which is better than risking further depreciation. Let's conclude our negotiation with this fair compromise given the inflation dynamics.""}"
