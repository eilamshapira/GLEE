"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer while considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 20% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer, but it's still fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the next round where the money will be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $4,000, but it's worth 20% less = $3,200 effective value to me

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth another 20% less to me
   * I could make a higher offer, but the decreased value might make it worse
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer

Looking at Bob's offer, while it gives him more than me, getting $3,200 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation in the next round.
