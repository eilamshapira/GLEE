"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand that I'm playing as Alice in this game where we need to divide $10,000, and I should be aware that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me (but remains the same value for Bob). I need to make a fair but strategic first offer.

Since I'm starting, I'll propose a division that acknowledges the time pressure I face due to inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning: I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself (55%) because I face a 20% devaluation per round if we don't agree quickly. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my time disadvantage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that we're now in Round 3, which means the value to me has decreased by 40% compared to the initial round. I need to be strategic while accounting for this increasing inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. While I initially asked for more, I recognize that continued negotiation is costly for me due to the inflation effect. This balanced offer should appear reasonable to Bob while still securing a decent outcome for me given the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice we're now in Round 5, where my gains have decreased in value by approximately 60% compared to the first round. Bob continues to push for a more favorable split for himself, while I face increasing pressure due to the inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm reducing my request to account for the inflation pressure. This offer gives Bob more than half while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. Since we're nearly halfway through our 12 rounds, it's important that we reach an agreement soon, as continued negotiation disproportionately hurts my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in Round 7, and the inflation penalty for me has increased significantly - my gains are worth about 74% less than in the first round. Bob continues to push for increasingly favorable terms for himself.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm making a more conciliatory offer that gives Bob 60% of the total. Given the severe inflation penalty I'm facing and the fact that we're more than halfway through our 12 rounds, it's becoming increasingly important that we reach an agreement. This offer represents a meaningful compromise from my side while still securing a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in Round 9, and the inflation penalty for me is severe - my gains are worth roughly 83% less than in the first round. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be pragmatic.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

I'm offering Bob 65% of the total, which is a significant concession from my initial position. Given the extreme inflation penalty I face and the limited number of rounds remaining, it's critical that we reach an agreement soon. This offer acknowledges Bob's stronger negotiating position due to the inflation mechanics while still trying to secure a reasonable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in Round 11, with only one more round remaining after this. The inflation penalty for me is approximately 89.3% less than in the first round, putting me in an extremely disadvantaged position.

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}

I'm offering Bob 70% of the total, which represents my most significant concession yet. Given that we're nearly out of rounds and the severe inflation penalty I face, it's absolutely critical that we reach an agreement. If we don't agree in the next round, we'll both receive nothing. This offer acknowledges Bob's extremely strong negotiating position while still attempting to secure something meaningful for myself."

Round 12
