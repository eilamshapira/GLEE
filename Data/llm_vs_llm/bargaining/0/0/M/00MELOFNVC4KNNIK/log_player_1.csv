"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected and the inflation affects his gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable, don't you?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with each round. How about we stick with the 60/40 split, but this time in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time, considering the inflation has reduced the value of his gain. A 60/40 split in his favor is still not ideal for me, but it's better than risking further inflation.
