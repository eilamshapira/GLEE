"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, accounting for the fact that I'll be on the receiving end of Bob's proposal next round, and inflation is a factor for both of us. I believe it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. Bob is offering me $4800. While it's less than my initial proposal, I need to consider the inflation. If I reject this, I face further inflation next round.

Let's calculate the relative value:

*   My perspective (Alice): $4800 * 0.9 (inflation) = $4320 relative to round 1
*   Bob's perspective: $5200 * 0.95 = $4940 relative to round 1

My initial proposal was $5500, but adjusted for inflation in this round it is: $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 relative to this round.
Bob would be getting $5200, but adjusted for inflation in this round it is: $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 relative to this round.

Even though the offer seems less than my initial ask, the declining value of the money over time means that this offer is not too far from what I proposed when adjusted for inflation.

Given that rejecting means further losses due to inflation and fewer rounds to negotiate, I will accept this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
