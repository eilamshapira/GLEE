"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Since inflation affects you more severely (20% per round versus my 10%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slight advantage in time preference."
