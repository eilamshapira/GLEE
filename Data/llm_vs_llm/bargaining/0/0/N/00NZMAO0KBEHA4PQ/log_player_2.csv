"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me less than half of the total amount, I need to consider the impact of inflation on future rounds. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, which is a significant decrease. Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice), delaying might put me at a disadvantage.
