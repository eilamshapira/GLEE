Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 55-45. A more balanced deal, considering the risk of further delay. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
