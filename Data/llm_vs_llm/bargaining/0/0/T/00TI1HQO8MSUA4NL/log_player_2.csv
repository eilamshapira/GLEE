Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the inflation impact on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. It's a compromise considering we're further into the game and the value keeps decreasing for me. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
