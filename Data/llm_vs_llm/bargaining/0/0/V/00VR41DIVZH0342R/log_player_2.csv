"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. Since it's the first round, there's no inflation effect yet
3. I could try to negotiate for more, but:
   - There's a risk Alice won't accept a less favorable deal
   - Future rounds will involve inflation
   - A fair split right away is a good outcome
