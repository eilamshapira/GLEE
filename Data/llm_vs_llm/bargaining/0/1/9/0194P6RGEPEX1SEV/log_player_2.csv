"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I believe this is a generous offer for you to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, so my potential maximum gain would be reduced. However, 40% seems a bit low for an initial offer, and I'll have the chance to make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Since this is just the first round and the inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and we should act quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a good deal considering the inflation.  We should settle this now before it gets any worse. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice has improved her offer from 4000$ to 4500$ for me
2. With 19% inflation for me, 4500$ is now worth about 3645$ in round 1 value
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation
4. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12
5. Alice seems to be more affected by inflation (36% vs my 19%), which might explain why she's becoming more generous

Given that:
- The offer is more balanced than before (45/55 split)
- Inflation is significantly eating into both our potential gains
- Alice is showing willingness to compromise
- The real value I'm getting is decreasing with each round

I think it's reasonable to accept this offer now before inflation reduces the value further.
