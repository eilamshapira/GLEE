"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (10%) each round. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. We both lose value, but this gives us a more equitable distribution considering we are only in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

My reasoning: Given the inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for Bob), and that we're only in round 2, I can still get a better deal. With Bob's offer, I would get $4500, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $3600. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that considers our different inflation rates but is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's find middle ground. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 10%) while being more balanced than my first offer. Let's settle this before we both lose more value.""}"
