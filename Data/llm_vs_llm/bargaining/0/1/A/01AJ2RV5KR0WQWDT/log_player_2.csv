"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (10%) each round. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. We both lose value, but this gives us a more equitable distribution considering we are only in round 2.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find middle ground. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 10%) while being more balanced than my first offer. Let's settle this before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
