Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and making an offer Bob might accept.  The inflation is hurting me, but I'm hoping Bob will be more amenable to a deal now that he's seen I'm willing to walk away from an unfair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While far from ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too severe. Accepting Bob's offer, while unfavorable, is better than risking getting an even worse outcome in the next round."
