"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is offering me $30 out of the $100, while keeping $70 for herself. This is less than an equal split, but I need to consider whether I might get a better offer if I reject and make a counter-offer.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), I don't lose anything by continuing to the next round. I could propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice. Since we're dividing $100, I'll propose a more equitable split while still trying to get a reasonable share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. This gives each of us $50, which represents an equitable division of the available funds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $35 instead of the initial $30, while keeping $65 for herself. 

I notice that Alice is affected by inflation - the money she gains is now worth 36% less than in the first round. This means the $65 she's asking for is actually worth only about $41.60 to her in terms of original value (65 Ã— 0.64 = 41.6).

Meanwhile, there's no inflation for me, so my $35 would be worth the full amount.

If I reject this offer and we move to another round, Alice will face even more inflation, which might make her more willing to give me a better offer in future rounds. However, there's also a risk she might become more aggressive in her demands.

Given that Alice rejected an even 50-50 split, and has now increased her offer to me, I think I can get a better deal in the next round as her inflation penalty increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure (now at 36%), I'll make an offer that recognizes this situation but still improves my position compared to her last offer.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Alice receives $40. Given that Alice is experiencing significant inflation on her gains (36% so far), this $40 will be worth even less to her in real terms. If we continue to additional rounds, her inflation penalty will likely increase further, making future negotiations even less favorable for her. This offer provides her an opportunity to secure some value now while giving me a reasonable share of the total."
