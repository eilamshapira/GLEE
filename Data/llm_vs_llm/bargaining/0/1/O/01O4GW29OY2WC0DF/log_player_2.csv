"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally. This way we both benefit fairly and without delay. Given the 10% inflation per round, an even split now maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. If I reject:
   * The value drops by 10% (to $90 total)
   * I get to make the next offer
   * But Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further devaluation

The 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable because:
* It's fair and equitable
* We avoid value loss from inflation
* There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in subsequent rounds due to Alice potentially rejecting my offers
