Description: ""A fair split considering the inflation difference."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Before making my offer, I want to recalculate the values based on inflation.

For Alice (me), the money is worth 10% less each round. So, the value of the money for me is now 80% of the original value (100% → 90% → 80%).

For Bob, the money is worth 5% less each round. So, the value of the money for him is now 90% of the original value (100% → 95% → 90%).

Given this, I'll make an offer that reflects these changes.

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

Description: ""An even split considering the cumulative effects of inflation for both parties."""
