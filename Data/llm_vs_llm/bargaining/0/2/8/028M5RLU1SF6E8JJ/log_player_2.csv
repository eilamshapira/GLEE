"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this fair! I'll take $60 and you get $40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. This isn't a particularly fair split.

Given that:
1. Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round while I face no depreciation
2. If I reject, I can make the next offer
3. We have plenty of rounds remaining (11 more)
4. Alice would get less value from waiting due to depreciation

I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round. Alice will be incentivized to accept a better offer for me due to her depreciation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 5% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a more balanced split. I'll offer a 50-50 split, which is fairer than her initial proposal, and emphasize that waiting will only reduce the value for her.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since you face 5% depreciation each round, this is actually better for you than waiting for future rounds. Let's make this deal now and both benefit equally.""}"
