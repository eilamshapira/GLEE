"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept and avoid inflation affecting my share.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage but is still reasonably fair
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will have 5% inflation for me, making my money worth less
3. The split is close enough to 50-50 that Bob might accept to avoid negotiation costs"
