"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my Round 1 offer: I get $51 and you get $49. I believe this nearly even split is fair and avoids further delays. I hope you agreeâ€”looking forward to a smooth resolution! 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. While it's close to a 50-50 split, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Since there's no immediate pressure to accept and I'll have the opportunity to propose next, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both seem to value fairness, I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor given that I waited patiently through round 1. This 55-45 split is still quite reasonable, and accepting now would avoid further delays and uncertainty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate our continued dialogue. For round 3, I'm proposing that you receive $52 and I get $48. This offer acknowledges your patience from the previous round while aiming for an overall fair outcome. I hope we can settle now and avoid any further delays. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a good offer that's actually in my favor. Alice has moved from her initial position of wanting $51 to now accepting $48, giving me the majority share at $52. Given that there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and this is already a favorable split for me, I should accept.
