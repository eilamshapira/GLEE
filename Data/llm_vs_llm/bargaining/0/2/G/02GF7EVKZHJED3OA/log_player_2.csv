"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly, Bob. I'm offering you a thousand to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. A 90-10 split heavily favoring Alice isn't fair, especially when we're both equal participants in this negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split this 50-50. This way we both walk away with a good amount before inflation kicks in further.""}"
