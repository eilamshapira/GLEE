"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, meaning I would get $5,000.

I need to consider the inflation factor - if I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means in round 2, the full $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me, so even if I got all of it (which is unlikely), I'd effectively get less than the $5,000 being offered now.

Given that this is a fair split and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I should accept this offer.
