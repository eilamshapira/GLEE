Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's try a 50/50 split. It's only fair, and we both get a good chunk before inflation hits us harder. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
