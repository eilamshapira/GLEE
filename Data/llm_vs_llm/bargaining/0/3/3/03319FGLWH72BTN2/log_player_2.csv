"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. 50-50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. In the first round, with no inflation yet, $50 is worth the full $50. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but then the total value will be reduced by 5% for me, meaning any amount I get will be worth less.

A 50-50 split is quite fair, and trying to negotiate for more might result in both of us losing value due to inflation. Getting $50 now is better than trying to get a larger share of a shrinking pot.
