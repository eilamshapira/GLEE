"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose to take $6000 while you take $4000. This way we both get a decent share. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. 

While this gives me 40% of the total, which is a substantial amount, I could potentially get more if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I don't lose anything by continuing to the next round.

I think I'll reject this offer and propose a more balanced division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more even split that's still favorable to Alice but gives me a fairer share.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest approach since we're both equally involved in this negotiation. This way we both get $5,000 and can end the game with an equal outcome. What do you think?""}"
