Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know waiting costs me 5% per round, so I'm offering you a slightly better share now. I'd like us to settle immediately before my portion shrinks further. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid any more delay. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
