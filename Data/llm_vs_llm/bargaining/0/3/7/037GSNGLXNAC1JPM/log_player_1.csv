"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

To calculate the value of the offer, I'll multiply my gain by 0.8 (1 - 0.20 inflation):

4000 * 0.8 = 3200

So, the offer is equivalent to me getting $3200 and Bob getting $6000.

Considering this, my response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in Round 2 and another 20% less in Round 3, but the initial reduction was from the original value, so it's cumulative: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, then 0.8 - 0.2*0.8 = 0.8 - 0.16 = 0.64).

To calculate the value of my offer, I'll consider this reduction.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""My turn again, a bit more generous!""
}
```

Note that, due to inflation, the $5500 I'm offering myself is actually worth $5500 * 0.64 = $3520 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to the end, time to get serious! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the value of the offer, I'll multiply my gain by the inflation factor (1 - 0.488 = 0.512).

3500 * 0.512 = 1792

So, the offer is equivalent to me getting $1792 and Bob getting $6500.

Considering this, my response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round (calculated as 1 - 0.488 - 0.2 = 0.312 for the previous round, but since the initial reduction was from the original value, and then another 20% reduction: 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096, then 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904).

However, the correct way to calculate this is to multiply the previous inflation factor by 0.8 (1 - 0.2): 
0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096

To calculate the value of my offer, I'll consider this reduction.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Time to be fair, 50/50!""
}
```

Note that, due to inflation, the $5000 I'm offering myself is actually worth $5000 * 0.4096 = $2048 to me."
