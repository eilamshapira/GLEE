"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way, we both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split, where she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000.

If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round, I'd get $5,000 of that $8,000 value (equivalent to $4,000 of the original value).

Given that inflation impacts me more severely than Alice (20% vs 5%), delaying might not be in my best interest. The current offer gives me $4,000, which is reasonable considering the inflation penalties I face.
