"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid the inflation penalty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation effect.

If I reject, we move to Round 2 where the money loses 20% of its value for me, meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $800,000 from my perspective. If I were to propose a 50-50 split in Round 2, I'd get $400,000, which is less than the $450,000 Alice is offering me now.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that this is a reasonable first offer giving me 45% of the full amount, I'll accept.
