"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I think this is a reasonable offer. We both want to end this game soon. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money after the inflation.

For me (Alice), the value of $100 is now worth 80% of its original value (100% - 20% = 80%). So, effectively, for me, we are dividing $80 ""real"" dollars.

For Bob, the value of $100 is now worth 90% of its original value (100% - 10% = 90%). So, effectively, for him, we are dividing $90 ""real"" dollars.

Given this, I need to offer Bob enough to make him accept, while still maximizing my gain. Bob offered me 40 in round 2, effectively 40 original dollars, which I rejected. Now I'll try to make an offer that I'll be willing to accept if the roles were reversed.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want to end this soon. I'll offer you 48, which is a good deal considering the inflation. That's effectively $48 in original value. I'm only taking 52, which is effectively worth only $41.60 to me now. This is my best offer.""
}
