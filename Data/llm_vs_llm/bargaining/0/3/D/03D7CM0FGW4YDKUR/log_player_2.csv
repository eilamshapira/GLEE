Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a generous offer considering we both lose value with each round.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I think this is a reasonable offer. We both want to end this game soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to end this soon. I'll offer you 48, which is a good deal considering the inflation. That's effectively $48 in original value. I'm only taking 52, which is effectively worth only $41.60 to me now. This is my best offer. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
