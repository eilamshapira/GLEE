"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money I would receive in this round versus potentially waiting for a later round and risking the money being worth less due to inflation.

Given that the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I should calculate the present value of accepting this offer now versus the potential future value if I reject it.

However, since this is the first round, the money has not yet depreciated for me, so I'll consider the offer based on its face value.

Alice is offering me $400,000, and she would take $600,000. This is not an equal split, but considering the rules of the game, especially the inflation aspect that affects me, I need to weigh the risk of waiting.

For now, I'll decide based on the principle of getting a significant amount early on, given the risk of losing value over time.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation factor that reduces the value of the money for me by 5% each round, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

Given that this is the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me than in the first round. So, the $1,000,000 is effectively worth $950,000 to me.

I'll aim for a split that reflects a bit of generosity to encourage Alice to accept, while also considering my own loss due to inflation.

Let's propose a 50/50 split, which seems fair but also consider that I'm making a concession due to the inflation factor affecting me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer and now she's making a new proposal, I need to consider the current value of the money to me, taking into account the inflation.

The money is now worth 9.75% less to me compared to the first round. This means if I were to accept $350,000, its value to me would be effectively $350,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $318,250.

On the other hand, Alice's offer gives her $650,000, which is worth its full value to her since she's not affected by inflation.

Considering this, I need to weigh the pros and cons. Accepting this offer gives me less than a third of the total value when considering the inflation impact on me, but it guarantees I get something.

However, I still have several rounds left, and I might be able to negotiate a better split or make a counteroffer that Alice finds acceptable.

Given the significant disparity in this offer and the fact that I've only gone through a couple of rounds, I think it's worth holding out for a potentially better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation factor, the money is now worth 14.76% less to me than in the first round (5% in the first round, 5% of the remaining 95% in the second round, and 5% of the remaining 90.25% in the third round, which gives a cumulative effect).

To calculate the effective value:
- First round: 100%
- Second round: 100% * 0.95 = 95%
- Third round: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%
- Fourth round: 90.25% * 0.95 = 85.7375%

So, the money is worth approximately 85.74% of its original value to me.

Given this, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also reflects the decreasing value of the money to me. I'll aim for a split that is slightly more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, hoping she'll accept to avoid further depreciation of the money's value to me.

Let's propose a split where I get 45% and Alice gets 55%. This way, I'm acknowledging the inflation impact while trying to find a mutually acceptable division.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 325000 
# Alice gain: 675000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer, I need to consider her new proposal in the context of the current inflation impact on the money's value to me.

The money is now worth 18.55% less to me compared to the first round. This means if I were to accept $325,000, its effective value to me would be $325,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $264,425.

Alice's offer gives her $675,000, which retains its full value to her.

Considering the decreasing value of the money to me and the fact that I'm getting closer to the midpoint of the total rounds (12 rounds), I need to weigh the risk of holding out for a potentially better offer against the guarantee of getting something now.

However, Alice's current offer still seems to favor her significantly, and I believe I can try to negotiate a better split or wait for a more favorable offer, given that I still have several rounds left.

The effective value of $264,425 is a significant consideration, but I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to see if I can secure a better deal.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation factor, the money is now worth approximately 22.19% less to me than in the first round (calculating the cumulative effect of 5% reduction each round).

To calculate the effective value:
- First round: 100%
- Second round: 100% * 0.95 = 95%
- Third round: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%
- Fourth round: 90.25% * 0.95 = 85.7375%
- Fifth round: 85.7375% * 0.95 = 81.450625%
- Sixth round: 81.450625% * 0.95 = 77.32809375%

So, the money is worth approximately 77.33% of its original value to me.

Given this significant reduction in value, I need to make an offer that acknowledges the inflation impact while trying to secure a reasonable amount. I'll propose a split that reflects the decreasing value of the money to me but still aims for a mutually acceptable division.

Let's propose a split where I get 42% and Alice gets 58%. This offer is more generous to Alice than my previous ones, considering the increasing impact of inflation on the money's value to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer, I need to consider her new proposal in the context of the current inflation impact on the money's value to me.

The money is now worth 26.49% less to me compared to the first round. This means if I were to accept $300,000, its effective value to me would be $300,000 * (1 - 0.2649) = $220,470.

Alice's offer gives her $700,000, which retains its full value to her.

At this point, I've gone through more than half of the total rounds, and the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money to me. While Alice's offer still seems to favor her, I need to consider the risk of not getting anything if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.

The effective value of $220,470 is a substantial reduction from the original amount, but it's a guaranteed amount if I accept. Given the diminishing value of the money to me and the increasing risk of not securing a better deal, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure I get something.
