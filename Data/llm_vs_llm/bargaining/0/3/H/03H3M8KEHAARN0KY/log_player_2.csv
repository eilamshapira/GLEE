"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer, but it's still fair. If we delay too long, we both lose money due to the 10% inflation each round. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $45 while she gets $55
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But total value decreases by 10% to $90
3. This is a fairly reasonable first offer:
   - The split is close to 50/50
   - Alice's point about inflation is valid
   - If I reject, my next offer would be working with less money

Given that it's a reasonable offer and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept.
