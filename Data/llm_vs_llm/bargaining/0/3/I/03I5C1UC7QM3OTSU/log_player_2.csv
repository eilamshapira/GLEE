"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer. I, as Bob, am offered $4000. Alice is offered $6000. We need to consider the time value of money.

If I reject, the money's value decreases by 20% for me and 5% for Alice. This means in round 2, the total pot is effectively worth less to both of us. I need to decide if I think I can get a better offer in the next 11 rounds considering the declining value.

Let's calculate the value of $4000 in round 1 to me: $4000.

If I reject, in the worst case scenario, we reach round 12, and both get nothing. I need to assess the potential gains of negotiating further versus the loss of value with each round.

While $4000 is less than half, it's a significant sum. Considering the depreciation, it's a reasonable starting offer. I am slightly inclined to reject, but I will accept this offer, as it is a fairly good offer.
