"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. While I could accept her 60-40 split proposal, I also have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal in the next round if I reject it. Since we have 12 rounds total, there's room for negotiation, and a more equal split would be fairer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's fair for both of us.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest for both of us. This way we both get an equal share.""}"
