3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $3448 and you receive $6552. Given that every round further devalues the amount for each of us (10% for me and 5% for you), accepting this now ensures a fair distribution in light of our differing discount rates. I believe this division reflects the strategic balance and is in both our best interests. What do you think?",Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I understand your proposal considers the devaluation, but I believe my contribution to our partnership deserves a larger share. Let's be practical: I'm offering you $3000. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it while it's still worth something.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer. However, if I reject, I expect to secure a more favorable share in the upcoming round as my turn to propose approaches, taking into account our respective discount rates (my funds devaluing by 10% per round and yours by 5%). I believe waiting is more advantageous in this setting, so I'll have to pass on your current proposal.",Alice,2,reject
2742.0,7258.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 the values have declined further – my share is now affected by a 19% reduction (down to 81% of its original value) and yours by about 9.75% (at 90.25% of its original value). To keep you indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in Round 4 (where you’d secure about 68.97% of the pie nominally, which—after a one‐round waiting—translates to roughly the same effective value you’d get now), I propose that you receive $7258 and I take $2742. This way, your effective value this round is approximately $7258 × 0.9025 ≈ $6552—the same as what you’d expect by waiting. I feel this is a fair and time‐consistent offer, so I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,3,
