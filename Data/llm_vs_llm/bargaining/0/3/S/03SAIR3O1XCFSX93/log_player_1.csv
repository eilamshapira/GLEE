"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3448, ""bob_gain"": 6552, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $3,448 and you receive $6,552. Given that every round further devalues the amount for each of us (10% for me and 5% for you), accepting this now ensures a fair distribution in light of our differing discount rates. I believe this division reflects the strategic balance and is in both our best interests. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your proposal considers the devaluation, but I believe my contribution to our partnership deserves a larger share. Let's be practical: I'm offering you $3000. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it while it's still worth something. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. However, if I reject, I expect to secure a more favorable share in the upcoming round as my turn to propose approaches, taking into account our respective discount rates (my funds devaluing by 10% per round and yours by 5%). I believe waiting is more advantageous in this setting, so I'll have to pass on your current proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2742, ""bob_gain"": 7258, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 the values have declined further – my share is now affected by a 19% reduction (down to 81% of its original value) and yours by about 9.75% (at 90.25% of its original value). To keep you indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in Round 4 (where you’d secure about 68.97% of the pie nominally, which—after a one‐round waiting—translates to roughly the same effective value you’d get now), I propose that you receive $7,258 and I take $2,742. This way, your effective value this round is approximately $7,258 × 0.9025 ≈ $6,552—the same as what you’d expect by waiting. I feel this is a fair and time‐consistent offer, so I hope you agree to settle now.""}"
