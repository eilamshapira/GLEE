"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $3448 and you receive $6552. Given that every round further devalues the amount for each of us (10% for me and 5% for you), accepting this now ensures a fair distribution in light of our differing discount rates. I believe this division reflects the strategic balance and is in both our best interests. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your proposal considers the devaluation, but I believe my contribution to our partnership deserves a larger share. Let's be practical: I'm offering you $3000. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it while it's still worth something.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 the values have declined further – my share is now affected by a 19% reduction (down to 81% of its original value) and yours by about 9.75% (at 90.25% of its original value). To keep you indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in Round 4 (where you’d secure about 68.97% of the pie nominally, which—after a one‐round waiting—translates to roughly the same effective value you’d get now), I propose that you receive $7258 and I take $2742. This way, your effective value this round is approximately $7258 × 0.9025 ≈ $6552—the same as what you’d expect by waiting. I feel this is a fair and time‐consistent offer, so I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 7258 
# Alice gain: 2742 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's logic is sound and aligns with a game-theoretic approach. Delaying further would only lead to smaller gains for both of us. Accepting ensures I receive a fair share considering the devaluation."
