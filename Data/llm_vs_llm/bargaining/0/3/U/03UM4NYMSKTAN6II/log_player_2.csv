"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm giving you 40 dollars! We both get a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, which means she would keep $60. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counteroffer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me.

If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round. If I were to then propose a 50-50 split, I'd get $45 (in round 2 value), which is only slightly better than taking $40 now.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable offer from Alice, I'll accept.
