500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's cut to the chase. Time is money—literally—as each round chips away 10% of my share. I propose we split the $1000000 evenly now so that neither of us loses more value by delay. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, I know you want to get the most from this, but my offer is still a good one, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. Take it and be happy.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, as we both know, every round we wait costs us dearly. In round 4, my share is now worth only 72.9% of its original value, and I suspect you're feeling some pressure too—even if your inflation rate isn't as steep. I'm offering you 800000 now to ensure we both salvage as much value as possible. This deal guarantees you a strong share without risking further depreciation in future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid unnecessary losses.",Bob,4,
