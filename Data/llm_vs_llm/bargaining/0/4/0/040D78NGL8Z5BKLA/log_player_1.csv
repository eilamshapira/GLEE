Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's cut to the chase. Time is money—literally—as each round chips away 10% of my share. I propose we split the $1000000 evenly now so that neither of us loses more value by delay. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we both know, every round we wait costs us dearly. In round 4, my share is now worth only 72.9% of its original value, and I suspect you're feeling some pressure too—even if your inflation rate isn't as steep. I'm offering you 800000 now to ensure we both salvage as much value as possible. This deal guarantees you a strong share without risking further depreciation in future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000
