Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally. The longer we negotiate, the less valuable the money becomes for me due to 5% inflation per round, and possibly for you too. A fair split now maximizes our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
