"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more equitable split. 55 for me, 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 10% inflation for me, the $45 is actually worth $40.5 to me now. I can make a better counter-offer and still have room for negotiation, especially since Bob's inflation rate seems lower than mine (5% vs 10%)."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. Let's meet closer to the middle with a 58-42 split. Remember, delays hurt us both due to inflation, and I'm affected more severely by it. This is a fair compromise.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting us both, but a fairer split now is better than risking nothing. I propose 52 for me, 48 for you. It's close to even and we can secure something now. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): With inflation at 27.1% for me, the $48 is worth about $35 in real value. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation will keep eating away at my gains. Bob is moving towards a more equitable split, and given the asymmetric inflation rates (mine being worse), it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds."
