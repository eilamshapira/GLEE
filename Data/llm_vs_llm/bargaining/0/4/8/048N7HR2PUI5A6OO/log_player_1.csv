Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me at 55-45. Since we're dividing $100, and I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, this is a fair compromise. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing, so let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
