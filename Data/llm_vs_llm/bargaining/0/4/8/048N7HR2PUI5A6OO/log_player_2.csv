"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get 60 and you get 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split.

I need to consider inflation: with each round, money is worth 5% less to me (but not to Alice). If I reject, we'll go to round 2, and the value to me will decrease by 5%.

If I reject and offer a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $50 but with 5% inflation, making it worth $47.50 to me. That's still better than $40.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me at 55-45. Since we're dividing $100, and I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, this is a fair compromise. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing, so let's find a middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'll take a small hit to get this done. 55 for me, 45 for you.  This is your last chance for a decent deal before inflation really eats into your share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself. Due to 9.75% inflation at this point, the $45 is actually worth about $40.61 to me.

If I reject and we go to round 4, any amount I receive will be worth 14.26% less than the original value. For example, if I counteroffered with a 50-50 split and Alice accepted, my $50 would only be worth about $42.87 to me.

Alice's current offer of $45 (worth $40.61 to me after inflation) is getting closer to a fair deal considering my disadvantage with inflation. If we continue negotiating, the inflation will further reduce my effective gain.
