"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I get 5000$ next round, it would only be worth 4500$ to me
5. Given this, getting 4500$ now is actually quite reasonable
