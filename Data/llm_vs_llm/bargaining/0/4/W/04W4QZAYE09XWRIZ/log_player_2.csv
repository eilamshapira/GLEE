"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer.

Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
2. I have the advantage of making the next offer if I reject
3. $4,000 now is better than $4,000 later due to inflation
4. We have a limited number of rounds (12)

However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 10% inflation, I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that's more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage but is fair enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk further inflation. If she rejects, her counter-offer would be dealing with money worth 10% less in value for me, but I still have room to negotiate in future rounds if needed."
