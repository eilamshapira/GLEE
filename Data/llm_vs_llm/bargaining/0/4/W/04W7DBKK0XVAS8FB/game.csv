0.0,10000.0,"Bob, given that every delay costs me 10% of value while you remain fully patient, if you reject this round you’ll soon be able to claim virtually the entire $10000. To avoid further devaluation on my part and in light of your strong bargaining position, I’m offering you the full $10000 now. I hope you agree so we can wrap this up immediately.",Alice,1,
