"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given that every delay costs me 10% of value while you remain fully patient, if you reject this round you’ll soon be able to claim virtually the entire $10000. To avoid further devaluation on my part and in light of your strong bargaining position, I’m offering you the full $10000 now. I hope you agree so we can wrap this up immediately. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely favorable to me (Bob) as I'm being offered the entire $10,000. Alice recognizes that due to the asymmetric inflation impact, I have a strong negotiating position. If I reject, I could make my own offer next round, but this current offer already gives me the maximum possible amount.
