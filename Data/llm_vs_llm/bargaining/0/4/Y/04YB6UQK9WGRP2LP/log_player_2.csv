"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $45 now is better than a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. The split is relatively fair (45-55)

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty, this is a reasonable first offer.
