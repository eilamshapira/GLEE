"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation penalties for both of us. Since I face a higher inflation penalty (20%) compared to Bob's (10%), I should aim for a fair but quick resolution.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's a reasonable balance that gives both of us a substantial amount while being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where inflation will hurt both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
* I get $4500, but with 20% inflation penalty
* Actual value for me = $4500 * 0.8 = $3600

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
* Next round will have even worse inflation (40% for me, 30% for Bob)
* Maximum I could get would be significantly devalued

Since $3600 is still a significant amount and the inflation penalty will only get worse in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
