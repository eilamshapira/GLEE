"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $6000 and I get $4000 out of the $10,000 total.

If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the total value will be worth less due to inflation. For me, the money will be worth 10% less (so $9,000 total value), and for Alice, it will be worth 20% less (so $8,000 total value from her perspective).

This means if I reject, I need to be confident I can get more than $4000 in the next round to make it worthwhile. Since Alice would face steeper inflation (20%), she has more incentive to accept my next offer.

I think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my own proposal. I need to account for the fact that:

1) The total value has already decreased (10% for me, 20% for Alice)
2) If Alice rejects my offer, another round of inflation will occur
3) Alice has a stronger incentive to accept now due to her higher inflation rate

I'll offer a more balanced split that still gives me an advantage but is attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than face another 20% depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4500, which is less than her initial offer to herself, but given that the money is already worth 20% less to her, accepting this now is better than continuing to negotiate as values keep decreasing."
