Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll prepare a fair and strategic offer for Bob, considering the inflation rates.

""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. This is completely fair, and if we delay, both of us will lose value due to inflation - you'll lose 5% and I'll lose 20% per round. An equal split now maximizes our combined value.""}"
