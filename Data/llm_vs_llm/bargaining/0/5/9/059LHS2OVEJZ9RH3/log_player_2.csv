"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is completely fair, and if we delay, both of us will lose value due to inflation - you'll lose 5% and I'll lose 20% per round. An equal split now maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is an equal split, which seems fair, and considering the inflation rates, it's reasonable to accept the offer to maximize the combined value.
