"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer:
- It's a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
- If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round (only $80 total)
- Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get more than 62.5% just to match what I'm being offered now ($50)
- There's also the risk of further negotiations and value loss
