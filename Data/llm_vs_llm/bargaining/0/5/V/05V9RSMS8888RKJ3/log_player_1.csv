Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer an equal split. I'm proposing we each take $500000. This is fair for both of us. Please note that I'm under 20% inflation pressure per round, so delays significantly reduce the value for me. Let's come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
