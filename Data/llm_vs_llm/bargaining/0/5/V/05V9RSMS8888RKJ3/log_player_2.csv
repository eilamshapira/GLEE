"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $400000. We have 12 rounds, so let's be reasonable and come to an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $400,000 of the $1,000,000, leaving her with $600,000. That's not an even split, but I need to factor in the 20% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be worth 20% less, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. Given this inflation pressure, I should weigh whether getting $400,000 now is better than potentially negotiating for more in future rounds with diminishing total value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that reflects the inflation pressure I'm under while still trying to achieve a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer an equal split. I'm proposing we each take $500,000. This is fair for both of us. Please note that I'm under 20% inflation pressure per round, so delays significantly reduce the value for me. Let's come to an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your situation, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $450000 this time. Remember, the value of the money is decreasing for you with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer. Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. However, due to inflation, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in the first round.

The effective value to me would be: $450,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $450,000 × 0.64 = $288,000

This is significantly less than the $400,000 effective value I could have had in round 1. Alice also pointed out that she's not experiencing inflation, which puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate.

Given that my position weakens with each round due to inflation, and Alice has moved toward a more equitable split, accepting this offer makes sense.
