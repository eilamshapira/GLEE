Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I get $6000 and you get $4000. Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is tempting, but I think a slightly more balanced split is in order. How about we try $4500 for me and $5500 for you? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
