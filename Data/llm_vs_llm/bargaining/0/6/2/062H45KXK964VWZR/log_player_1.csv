"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since this is the first round and there's no inflation affecting me, I'll propose a fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 for each of us. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount."
