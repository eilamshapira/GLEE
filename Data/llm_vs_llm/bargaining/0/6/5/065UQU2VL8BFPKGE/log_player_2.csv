"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- The $100 will be worth 10% less to me in the next round ($90 total value)
- It will be worth 95% to Alice ($95 total value)
- I'll get to make the next proposal

Current offer:
- I get $40 right now
- Alice gets $60 right now

This is not a terrible offer, but given that I can make the next proposal and the money devalues more for me than for Alice, I should try to negotiate for a better deal quickly.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that the money is now worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice, I need to make a strategic offer that Alice is likely to accept, as another rejection would decrease the value further.

The total value is now effectively $90 for me and $95 for Alice. I should propose a split that gives Alice enough incentive to accept while maximizing my gain.

I'll propose a 50-50 split, which would be fair and reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50}

This offer is better for Alice than if she rejects and proposes again in the next round (where the total value would decrease further), so she should rationally accept it."
