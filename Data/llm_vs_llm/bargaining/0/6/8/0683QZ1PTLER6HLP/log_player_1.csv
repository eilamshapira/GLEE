"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced 55/45 split. This is fair considering we both face inflation, and you'll still get $45 at only 10% depreciation, while my share faces 20% depreciation per round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
