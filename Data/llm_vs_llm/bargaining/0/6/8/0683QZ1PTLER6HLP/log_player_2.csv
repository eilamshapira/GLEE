"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30.  It's a generous offer, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With 20% inflation per round for me and 10% for Alice, accepting later rounds will reduce the real value significantly. However, 30% is quite low for an initial offer.

If I reject, I can make a counter-proposal next round. The $100 will be worth 80% of its value for me and 90% for Alice. This means I could propose a more favorable split while still being attractive to Alice due to the lower inflation impact on her side.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering the inflation factors.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55/45 split. This is fair considering we both face inflation, and you'll still get $45 at only 10% depreciation, while my share faces 20% depreciation per round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're losing value far quicker than I am. I'll offer you 35 - take it or leave it, but it's the last time I'm going above 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully.

The $35 offered to me is now worth only 64% of the original value due to inflation (36% less), so effectively about $22.40 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we continue:
1. The inflation will get worse (20% more each round for me)
2. Alice seems committed to not offering more than 35 going forward
3. We're already in round 3 out of 12, and prolonging could lead to even worse outcomes

While 35/65 isn't ideal, given the asymmetric inflation rates and Alice's firm stance, it might be the best realistic outcome I can get at this point. If we continue, my negotiating position will only get weaker.
