"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering the different inflation rates affecting us and the need to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because while a 50-50 division might seem fair at first glance, the higher inflation rate affecting Bob (20% vs my 10%) means he has more incentive to agree quickly. This slightly higher portion for me acknowledges both our need to reach a timely agreement while still keeping the split reasonably fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This split is too unfavorable for me, especially considering that I have a lower inflation rate (10% vs Bob's 20%). This means I can afford to be more patient than Bob. While the total value is decreasing for both of us, it's decreasing faster for Bob, which gives me some negotiating leverage. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer of 55-45 and countered with 40-60, I'll adjust my offer slightly but maintain a position that favors me due to my lower inflation rate.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

This offer is more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal but still gives me a slight advantage. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions. With Bob's higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), accepting this offer now would be better for him than continuing to negotiate while his potential gains decrease more rapidly than mine."
