"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation rates.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice will face a 10% inflation penalty, while I'll face a 20% inflation penalty. This means if Alice rejects my counter-offer, any future earnings will be worth less to both of us, but more significantly to me.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, and considering that a 50/50 split is objectively fair, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further rounds where my negotiating position weakens more rapidly than Alice's.
