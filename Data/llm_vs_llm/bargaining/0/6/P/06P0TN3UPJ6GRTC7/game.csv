0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob – to avoid any delay (which costs me as the dollar’s value drops each round), I'll propose we settle now. You get the full $100, and I take nothing. I think this is fair given that if we wait, you’ll eventually be in the driving seat while my share loses value. Let me know if you agree!",Alice,1,
