"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – to avoid any delay (which costs me as the dollar’s value drops each round), I'll propose we settle now. You get the full $100, and I take nothing. I think this is fair given that if we wait, you’ll eventually be in the driving seat while my share loses value. Let me know if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
