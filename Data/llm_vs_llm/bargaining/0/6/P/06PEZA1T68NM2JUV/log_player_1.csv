"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I want to propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face while being fair.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges our different inflation penalties. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases more for you than for me. This split gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my first-mover position.""}"
