"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further erosion of value due to inflation, I propose we settle now with a division that reflects both our interests. Taking into account the risks of waiting, I suggest I receive $600k and you receive $400k. I believe this fair split will ensure we both secure a substantial portion despite the inflation effect. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
