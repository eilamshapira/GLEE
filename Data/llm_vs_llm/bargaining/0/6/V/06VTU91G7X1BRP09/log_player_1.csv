"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that slightly favors me, hoping Bob will accept it quickly. I want to avoid further rounds where my gains are diminished by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** My money is worth 10% less. Accepting $45 means I'm effectively getting $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 worth of value from the initial $100.
*   **Bob's perspective (unknown):** I don't know exactly how Bob values the money, but it's worth 5% less for him.

Given that the initial offer was $60, and now I'm being offered effectively $40.5, and considering further rounds will further reduce my value, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
