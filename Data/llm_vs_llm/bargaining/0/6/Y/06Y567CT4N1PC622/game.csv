500000.0,500000.0,"I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer. Remember that if you reject, we move to round 3 where you'll face 10% inflation on your share, so accepting this equal division now is in your best interest.",Bob,2,

900000.0,100000.0,My final offer. Take it or leave it. Inflation is eating away at your value too!,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm offering you a very reasonable 40% of the total. Since inflation is affecting my share by nearly 30% in the next round, I need to secure a larger nominal amount now. This split acknowledges both our positions fairly. Accepting this avoids further negotiation rounds where we both risk getting less value.",Bob,4,
