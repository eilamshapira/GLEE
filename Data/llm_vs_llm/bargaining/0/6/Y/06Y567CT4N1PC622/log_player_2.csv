"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A generous offer for you to accept immediately, accounting for potential inflation! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer doesn't seem fair to me at all. Alice is offering me only 1% of the total amount ($10,000) while keeping 99% ($990,000) for herself. Even considering inflation, this is extremely unbalanced.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer. Remember that if you reject, we move to round 3 where you'll face 10% inflation on your share, so accepting this equal division now is in your best interest.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My final offer. Take it or leave it. Inflation is eating away at your value too! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is still very unbalanced. Alice is offering me only 10% of the total ($100,000) while keeping 90% ($900,000) for herself. Even with the 19% inflation on my end, this remains a highly inequitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I'm offering you a very reasonable 40% of the total. Since inflation is affecting my share by nearly 30% in the next round, I need to secure a larger nominal amount now. This split acknowledges both our positions fairly. Accepting this avoids further negotiation rounds where we both risk getting less value.""}"
