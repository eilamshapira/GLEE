Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision as the offer is still slightly unfair to me. However, with inflation eating away at the total, rejecting it means I risk getting even less in the next round. It's better to secure something now than potentially lose more."
