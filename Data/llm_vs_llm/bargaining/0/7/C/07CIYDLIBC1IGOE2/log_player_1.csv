"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's agree on a swift deal to avoid any inflation losses. I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. Settling now means we both secure a better value than if we wait. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal. I think we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both. How about we try $55 for me and $45 for you? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the revised proposal. Given the current inflation effects on my share, I'm inclined to settle now with the $45 offer for me and $55 for you. Let's close the deal before further discounting impacts our payouts.""}"
