"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand I'm playing as Alice and need to make the first offer. Given that my money loses 10% value each round while Bob's doesn't, I should make a reasonable first offer to avoid costly delays.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's reasonable enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it
3. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 10% less to me"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $4,500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4,050 to me
2. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but that money will be worth another 10% less
3. Bob's offer isn't terrible - it's a 45-55 split
4. Prolonging the negotiation will cost me more due to inflation
5. Bob seems to be playing hardball, and further rounds might not yield better results for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it better to take this deal now rather than risk further devaluation of my share."
