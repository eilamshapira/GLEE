"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself. Since the money loses 10% value for Alice each round but keeps its value for me, I have an advantage in negotiating. If we go to the next round, I can propose a better split for myself, and Alice might be more inclined to accept since her share would be worth less to her.

In the next round, I could propose a more favorable split, knowing that Alice's 6000$ would only be worth 5400$ to her if she rejects my next offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I know Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a more balanced split. I'll offer a 5500/4500 split in my favor, which is more equitable than her initial offer. For Alice, rejecting this and waiting another round would mean her share would be worth 10% less, so this should be more appealing than continuing negotiations.
