60.0,40.0,"Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, considering that waiting further would diminish the total value even more, I propose a 55â€“45 split (in my favor) so that we keep as much value as possible. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances; let's agree and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point about the diminishing value, but I believe we can still find a more equitable split. Let's go to the next round and see if we can agree on something closer to 50-50.",Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, given the further decrease in value, I propose we split it 50-50. This way, we both get an equal share despite the inflation. Let's end this fairly and quickly.",Alice,3,
