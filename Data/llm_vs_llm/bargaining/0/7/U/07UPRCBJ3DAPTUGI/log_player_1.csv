Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that waiting further would diminish the total value even more, I propose a 55â€“45 split (in my favor) so that we keep as much value as possible. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances; let's agree and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about the diminishing value, but I believe we can still find a more equitable split. Let's go to the next round and see if we can agree on something closer to 50-50.""
