60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering the inflation risk we both face.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. Since inflation affects me more heavily (10% vs your 5%), this 55-45 split in my favor is actually very fair when accounting for the inflation difference. We should agree quickly before further value is lost.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Given the inflation disparity, a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. Let's end this before we both lose more value.",Bob,4,
