"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering the inflation risk we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offered $45 is worth even less due to 10% inflation (effectively $40.5), while Bob's share would suffer less from inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. Since inflation affects me more heavily (10% vs your 5%), this 55-45 split in my favor is actually very fair when accounting for the inflation difference. We should agree quickly before further value is lost.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation disparity, a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. Let's end this before we both lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, with the accelerating inflation effects (my $50 is actually worth about $36.45 in round 1 value), continuing to negotiate would likely result in even worse outcomes for both of us. A 50-50 split now is better than risking further rounds of inflation."
