"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is completely fair. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round and you aren't, an equal split now is in both our interests. We can finish this quickly and both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, especially considering Bob's inflation. I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get a significant amount.
