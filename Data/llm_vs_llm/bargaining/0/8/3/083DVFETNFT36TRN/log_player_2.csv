"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but I need to be mindful that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round for me only. This means any delay costs me value, while Alice doesn't face the same pressure.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer without much inflation impact yet, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is completely fair. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round and you aren't, an equal split now is in both our interests. We can finish this quickly and both walk away with a significant amount.""}"
