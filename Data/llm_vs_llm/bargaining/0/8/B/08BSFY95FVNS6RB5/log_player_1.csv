"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage, but I still want to make a reasonable offer to avoid too many rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Bob gets a decent portion while I maintain a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offered me $45 and wants $55 for himself
2. Due to 10% inflation for Bob, his $55 is actually worth $49.5 to him
3. My $45 is still worth $45 to me (no inflation)
4. If I reject, we move to round 3, where Bob's money will be worth even less
5. However, I believe I can get a better deal since I have the inflation advantage

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him in this round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept while leveraging my stronger position.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

With 20% inflation for Bob, his $35 is actually worth $28 to him. If he rejects this, his money will be worth even less in the next round, so this should be a compelling offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to 27.1% inflation for Bob, his $50 is actually worth only $36.45 to him
3. My $50 maintains its full value
4. Bob is showing more willingness to compromise
5. However, my negotiating position continues to strengthen due to inflation

Given that I still have a strong advantage due to inflation and there are many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Bob has shown willingness to compromise with the 50-50 offer, but his money is now worth 34.4% less in this round. I'll make an offer that gives me a better share while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting, given the increasing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

With 34.4% inflation, Bob's $30 is worth about $19.68 to him. If he rejects this, his money will be worth even less next round, so he should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than letting more value erode through inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $55 and wants $45 for himself
2. Due to 40.95% inflation for Bob, his $45 is actually worth only $26.57 to him
3. My $55 maintains its full value
4. We're halfway through the rounds (6 out of 12)
5. Bob's position continues to weaken with each round
6. His offers are gradually improving in my favor, showing he understands his weakening position

Given that we still have 6 rounds left and Bob's money will continue to lose value, I believe I can still get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth 46.86% less in this round, and seeing his gradual movement towards better offers for me, I'll make a strong offer that reflects my advantageous position while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

With 46.86% inflation, Bob's $25 is worth about $13.29 to him. He should seriously consider this offer because:
1. We're more than halfway through the rounds
2. His money continues to lose significant value each round
3. If he rejects, his position will be even weaker in the next round
4. The risk of getting nothing (if we reach round 12 without agreement) is becoming more real"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $58 and wants $42 for himself
2. Due to 52.17% inflation for Bob, his $42 is actually worth only $20.09 to him
3. My $58 maintains its full value
4. We're now in round 8 of 12
5. Bob's offers are still gradually improving (from $55 to $58 for me)
6. However, his position is significantly weaker now

Given that:
- We still have 4 rounds left
- Bob's money will continue to lose value rapidly
- His offers are showing an upward trend in my favor
- The inflation effect is now very severe

I believe I can still get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With only 4 rounds remaining and Bob's money now worth 56.95% less, I'll make an aggressive offer that reflects my very strong position while still giving Bob enough to potentially accept rather than risk getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

With 56.95% inflation, Bob's $20 is worth only about $8.61 to him. He should seriously consider this offer because:
1. Only 3 rounds remain after this
2. His money has lost more than half its value
3. If he rejects, his money will be worth even less in the next rounds
4. The risk of both getting nothing (if we reach round 12) is becoming very real
5. Even a larger share of heavily depreciated money would be worth less to him than this offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical offer:
1. Bob is offering me $62 and wants $38 for himself
2. Due to 61.26% inflation for Bob, his $38 is actually worth only $14.72 to him
3. My $62 maintains its full value
4. We're now in round 10 of 12 - only 2 rounds left
5. Bob's offers are still gradually improving (from $58 to $62 for me)
6. However, we're very close to the deadline

Given that:
- Only 2 rounds remain
- The risk of both getting nothing is now very high
- While I could potentially get a better deal, the risk might not be worth it
- $62 is a decent amount for me, and it's a clear improvement from previous offers

I will accept this offer. The risk of getting nothing by pushing too hard outweighs the potential benefit of holding out for more.
