"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point, and we can avoid losing value due to inflation as we go on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round's $100 will be worth only $90 to me due to 10% inflation
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
4. A 45-55 split is relatively fair, not too far from 50-50
5. Getting $45 now is better than risking lower value in future rounds

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable nature of the offer, I'll accept.
