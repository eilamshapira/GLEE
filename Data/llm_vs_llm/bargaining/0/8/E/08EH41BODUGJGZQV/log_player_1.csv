"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while an equal division might seem fairest, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'll suffer if we go to the next round. By offering Bob a slightly smaller amount ($4,500), I'm still giving him a substantial portion while protecting myself from potential inflation losses."
