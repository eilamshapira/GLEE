"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that a slight advantage for me seems reasonable to start, given the inflation risk I face. I hope Bob finds this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. Bob is proposing a 50/50 split.

*   **Alice's perspective:** My potential gain is $5000, but it's worth 10% less than in Round 1. So, it's effectively worth $4500 in Round 1 terms.
*   **Weighing the risks:** If I reject, I risk further inflation and the potential for Bob to offer even less in subsequent rounds. There are only 10 rounds remaining.

Given the diminishing value of the money due to inflation, I will accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
