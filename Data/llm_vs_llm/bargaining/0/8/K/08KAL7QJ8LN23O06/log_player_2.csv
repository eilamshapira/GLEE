"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total sum. Since this is the first round, I need to think about the inflation effect. If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. 

If I counter-offer in round 2, I'd need to secure more than $4,000 to make rejection worthwhile. However, Alice might also reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given this is the first round and inflation will reduce the value in subsequent rounds, I'll reject this offer as I believe I can secure a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair while accounting for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. With the 5% inflation affecting me each round, it's important that we reach an agreement soon, and an equal split represents the most balanced and reasonable approach."
