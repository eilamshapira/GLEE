"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine keeps its value, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. After this round, $5000 would only be worth $4750 to Alice, while still being worth $5000 to me.

I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, leveraging this depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, I can justify taking a larger share while still making it worthwhile for her to accept (as rejecting would mean another 5% loss for her).

Her $5000 from the previous offer would now be worth $4750 to her. I'll offer her $4500, which is still better for her to accept now than to reject and get even less value in the next round.
