"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me 30% of the total, which is quite a bit less than a fair 50-50 split. Since we're just starting and I lose 10% value each round due to inflation, I need to consider if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer next round. If I reject, I'll have a chance to propose a more favorable split, though my $30 would effectively be worth $27 in the next round if I were to get the same offer.

I'll reject this initial offer to aim for a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation that affects me and provides a reasonable split.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to propose this split because it's closer to an even division while accounting for the 10% inflation that affects me. This way, we can both walk away with a significant portion, and we can avoid further rounds where my share would lose more value due to inflation."
