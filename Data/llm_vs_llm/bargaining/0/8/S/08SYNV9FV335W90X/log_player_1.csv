"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll send an offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

Since we're starting the first round and I need to consider the 20% inflation per round affecting my gains, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is an equal split which is fair and has a good chance of being accepted immediately, saving me from losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer gives me less than my original proposal while giving Bob more, and I need to consider whether I can make a better counter-offer next round, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to carefully consider my offer since the inflation effect means the money is worth 40% less to me than in round 1.

Given that Bob rejected the equal split and tried to get more, I'll make a more strategic offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm asking for a larger portion to offset some of the inflation effects, while still giving Bob a substantial amount that might be acceptable to him."
