"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I propose this split as it's closer to an even division while still favoring Alice slightly, which might make it more appealing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from $4000 to $4500 for me, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, we're still only in round 3 out of 12, and while this is better, I think there's still room for a more equitable split. The risk of rejection is relatively low at this stage since we have many rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Alice is gradually moving towards a more equal split. I'll propose a very fair split now, nearly 50-50, but still giving Alice a small advantage to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100}

This offer is very close to an even split while still giving Alice a slight edge. It's a reasonable and fair proposal that should be hard to reject on fairness grounds."
