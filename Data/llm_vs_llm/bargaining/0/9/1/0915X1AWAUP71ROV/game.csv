73.79,26.21,"Hi Bob – I'd like to settle in Round 1. Considering that money loses value for you as rounds pass (20% per round) while mine remains fully valuable, my calculations show that if you wait to propose in Round 2 your best effective outcome would be roughly $26.21 in current‐dollar terms. Therefore, I propose to keep $73.79 and give you $26.21. This division is fair in light of our respective discount rates and our limited rounds. I hope you agree and we can end the game immediately.",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Alice, while I understand your analysis, it underestimated my bargaining position. Even with the 20% depreciation, I can still get a better outcome than your initial offer. I propose $70 for me and $30 for you. This is fair because even though my money will depreciate by 20%, I'll still get an effective $56, which is much better than your offer of $26.21. If you reject, we'll lose more rounds and both risk getting nothing. Let's settle now.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob – I appreciate your proposal. After considering my options, I’ve realized that accepting your allocation of $30 for me (with my money retaining full value) is better than waiting to propose my own deal in Round 3. In Round 3, even though I’d be the proposer, I’d be forced to offer you enough to match your future opportunity, which would leave me around $20 nominal. Since $30 now is preferable, I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
