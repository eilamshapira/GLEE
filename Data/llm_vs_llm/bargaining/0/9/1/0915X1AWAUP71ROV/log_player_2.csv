"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I'd like to settle in Round 1. Considering that money loses value for you as rounds pass (20% per round) while mine remains fully valuable, my calculations show that if you wait to propose in Round 2 your best effective outcome would be roughly $26.21 in current‐dollar terms. Therefore, I propose to keep $73.79 and give you $26.21. This division is fair in light of our respective discount rates and our limited rounds. I hope you agree and we can end the game immediately. 
# Bob gain: 26.21 
# Alice gain: 73.79 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is correct that there's time pressure on my side due to the 20% depreciation per round.
2. If I reject and propose in Round 2, my money will be worth 20% less.
3. However, in Round 2, I could propose a much more favorable split for myself (like keeping 70$), and Alice might accept because she'd still get something rather than risk further rounds.
4. My $70 in Round 2 would be worth $56 after the 20% depreciation, which is significantly better than the $26.21 offered now.

Alice's analysis seems to underestimate my bargaining power in Round 2. While she's right about the time pressure, her offer is too low given that I could still make a better counter-offer next round.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70,

I propose $70 for me and $30 for you. This is fair because even though my money will depreciate by 20%, I'll still get an effective $56, which is much better than your offer of $26.21. If you reject, we'll lose more rounds and both risk getting nothing. Let's settle now.""}"
