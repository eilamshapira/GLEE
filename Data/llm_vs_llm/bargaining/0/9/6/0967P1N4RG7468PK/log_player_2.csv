"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, if I reject this, future rounds will have less real value for me.

Let me think about my potential counter-offer in round 2. Even with 5% inflation, I could propose a more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage but still provides Alice with a substantial portion. I believe this balances our interests and acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement to avoid losing value to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is experiencing higher inflation than I am (19% vs 9.75%), which is important information. She's now offering me $4,200 instead of her initial $4,000 offer.

Given that:
1. Alice has a higher inflation rate than me
2. She's slightly improved her offer
3. Continued rejections will reduce the real value for both of us
4. I have more rounds of inflation advantage

If I reject this offer, my next counter-offer would be affected by about 15% inflation for me and about 24% inflation for Alice. This increasing difference in inflation rates gives me some leverage in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice is experiencing a higher inflation rate than I am (19% vs 9.75% in round 3), I should consider this advantage while making a reasonable offer. I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges our different inflation rates while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5,300 and Alice receives $4,700. This is a slight improvement for Alice compared to my previous offer, recognizing that she's facing higher inflation. I believe this is fair and gives us both good value while acknowledging that continued negotiation will reduce the real value for both of us, especially for Alice given her higher inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice the inflation gap is widening significantly (18.55% for me vs 34.39% for Alice). Alice has increased her offer to me again, now to $4,400.

Given that:
1. Alice's money is losing value much faster than mine (nearly twice as fast)
2. She's gradually improving her offers to me
3. We're now in round 5 of potentially 12 rounds
4. This inflation trend gives me increasing leverage

I think I can still get a better deal, especially considering Alice's severe inflation rate. If we continue to the next round, her money will be worth even less, which should motivate her to make a more favorable offer soon.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice is experiencing a much higher inflation rate (34.39% vs my 18.55%), I have a strategic advantage. However, I should make a reasonable offer that acknowledges this dynamic while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering her rapidly diminishing returns.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a perfectly even split of $5,000 each. This is more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, recognizing her significantly higher inflation rate. With her money losing value at nearly twice the rate of mine, a 50-50 split now is more valuable to her than continuing negotiations. This fair division should be appealing to both of us and allow us to conclude our negotiation before further inflation diminishes our gains."
