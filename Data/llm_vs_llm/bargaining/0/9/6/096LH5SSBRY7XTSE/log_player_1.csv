"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split to start the negotiation, but slightly in my favor given I move first.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split close to 50-50, giving Bob a good amount while accounting for my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I accept this 50-50 split now, due to 5% inflation, my $50 is actually worth $47.50. While this is less than what I proposed initially, rejecting means facing another 5% inflation in the next round, and potentially worse offers. The longer this goes, the less value we both get.

Given we have limited rounds, and this is a fairly reasonable offer despite the small inflation loss, I'll accept.
