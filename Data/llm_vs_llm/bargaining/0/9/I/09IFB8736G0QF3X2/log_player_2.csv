# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the impact of inflation on the money's value:

The money is now worth 20% less for me, meaning it's effectively worth $800,000 to me. For Alice, the money is worth 5% less, so $950,000.

I'll offer a division that accounts for that.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, taking into account the continued inflation:

*   **My effective value:** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less in round 2, and another 20% less in round 4, making the value $640,000 to me.
*   **Alice's effective value:** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 5% less in round 2, and another 5% less in round 4, making the value $902,500 to her.

Considering this, I will offer a slightly more favorable division for myself this round.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, here's my offer for round 6, factoring in the inflation:

*   **My effective value:** After two rounds of 20% inflation, and a further 20% in this round, the $1,000,000 is now worth $512,000 to me.
*   **Alice's effective value:** After two rounds of 5% inflation, and a further 5% in this round, the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $857,375 to her.

Given that the money is losing value more rapidly for me, I'll make an offer that slightly favors me.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000}

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 8, taking inflation into account.

*   **My effective value:** After seven rounds of 20% inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $409,600 to me.
*   **Alice's effective value:** After seven rounds of 5% inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $814,506 to her.

Given the rapid depreciation of the money's value for me, I'll make a more aggressive offer this round to secure a larger share.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, here's my offer for round 10, adjusting for the ongoing inflation.

*   **My effective value:** After nine rounds of 20% inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $335,544 to me.
*   **Alice's effective value:** After nine rounds of 5% inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $773,509 to her.

Given the accelerating devaluation for me, it is important to secure a reasonable share, even if it means Alice's share is larger in nominal terms.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is the final round. My priority is to get *something* before we both walk away with nothing.

*   **Alice's effective value:** The $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $734,841 to her.

Given the extreme devaluation for me, and the risk of losing everything, I'll make a final, slightly more generous offer.
