"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Let's end this quickly before inflation affects us too much! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Bob, and I need to consider the inflation and the limited number of rounds.

Let's calculate the value of $40 for me and $60 for Alice after 1 round:

*   **Bob:** $40 * (1 - 0.20) = $32
*   **Alice:** $60 * (1 - 0.05) = $57

Now, let's think about rejecting. If I reject, I get to propose in round 2, but the money will be worth even less. I need to propose something that Alice will accept in Round 2, but it will be worth less overall due to inflation.

Given the relatively high initial offer to Alice and the substantial inflation for me (20%), the present value of $32 is not bad for me. It's better to take something now rather than risk getting nothing later due to my inflated losses and potentially making a bad offer later.
