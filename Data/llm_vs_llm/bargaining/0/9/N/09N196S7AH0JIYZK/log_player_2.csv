"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept this offer or make a counter-proposal, taking into account the decreasing value in future rounds.

Alice is offering me $45 and taking $55. If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the full $100 would only be worth $90 to me). Meanwhile, it will only be worth 5% less to Alice.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying is costlier for me than for Alice, which puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations. While the current split isn't 50-50, getting $45 now is better than potentially ending up with less after negotiation costs.
