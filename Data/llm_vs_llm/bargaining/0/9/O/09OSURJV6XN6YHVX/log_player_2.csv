"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer of a 50-50 split:

1. It's a fair split at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I lose 10% value due to inflation
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split for myself
4. But Alice might reject, leading to further inflation losses
5. A 500k guaranteed now is better than risking losses through inflation

Given that inflation will eat into my gains if we delay, and this is a perfectly fair offer, I'll accept.
