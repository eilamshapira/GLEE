"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given the effort we're putting into this negotiation. Let's settle this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 10% inflation means I would only get $405,000 in real value ($450,000 * 0.9), while Bob gets the full $550,000. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation affecting my gains each round, I need to adjust my offer to compensate. With this split, my real value would be $585,000 (after 20% inflation), which is more balanced with your $350,000. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting your gains and the urgency to reach an agreement, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable, ensuring we both walk away with a significant amount despite the ongoing rounds. Let's end this now and share the money equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With 27.1% inflation, I'll get $364,500 in real value ($500,000 * 0.729), while Bob gets $500,000. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation will keep reducing my real gains. A 50-50 split at this point is reasonable given the circumstances."
