"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given this is the first round and considering the 10% inflation penalty per round, I should make a reasonable first offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose taking $60 while giving Bob $40, which is a fair split considering I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair
2. Due to inflation, my $50 is now worth $45 (90% of original value)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - My money will be worth only 80% of original value
   - Bob might offer even less
   - We're using up rounds, risking getting nothing
4. While not ideal, this is a reasonable offer given the inflation pressure
