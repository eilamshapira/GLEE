"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My $40 would be worth 10% less ($36)
   * Her $60 would be worth 5% less ($57)
3. While I could make a counter-offer, she might reject it, leading to further inflation
4. The split isn't 50-50, but considering inflation and the risk of multiple rounds, $40 isn't terrible

I'll reject this offer because I believe I can get a better deal, and the first-round inflation penalty isn't too severe yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split before inflation reduces the value further for both of us""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is the most fair and commonly accepted division
2. If Alice rejects, her $50 would be worth $47.50 next round (5% less)
3. My $50 would be worth $45 next round (10% less)
4. This creates pressure to accept now rather than lose value
5. The message emphasizes mutual benefit and fairness"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, this is a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $43, which after 19% inflation is worth about $34.83
2. She's taking $57, which after 9.75% inflation is worth about $51.44
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 29% less than original value
   * Her money will be worth 14.75% less than original value
   * The gap keeps widening with each round
4. Alice has improved her offer from the first round ($40 â†’ $43)
5. Given the accelerating inflation difference (10% vs 5% per round), delaying further puts me at a growing disadvantage
6. We've already lost significant value through two rounds of negotiation

While not ideal, this offer is reasonable considering the inflation pressure, and further negotiation will likely leave us both worse off.
