550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 55/45 split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round if we delay, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without unnecessary negotiation.",Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I notice you're facing higher inflation than I am (20% vs my 10%). Let's be efficient - I'm offering you $400000 which is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates and gives us both a good outcome without further delays.",Alice,3,
