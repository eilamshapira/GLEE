Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 55/45 split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round if we delay, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without unnecessary negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 60/40 split is a fairer deal considering the inflation we're both facing.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I notice you're facing higher inflation than I am (20% vs my 10%). Let's be efficient - I'm offering you $400,000 which is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates and gives us both a good outcome without further delays.""}"
