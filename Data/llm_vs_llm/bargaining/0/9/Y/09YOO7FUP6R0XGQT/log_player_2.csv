"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 55/45 split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round if we delay, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without unnecessary negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice you're facing higher inflation than I am (20% vs my 10%). Let's be efficient - I'm offering you $400000 which is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates and gives us both a good outcome without further delays. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
