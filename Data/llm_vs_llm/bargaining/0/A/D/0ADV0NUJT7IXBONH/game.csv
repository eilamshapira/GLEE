60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the different inflation rates affecting us. This way we both get a good portion before inflation reduces the value.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Given the higher inflation rate affecting you, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This offer considers the diminishing value of money for both of us but leans slightly towards me due to the smaller impact of inflation on my side.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering I'm facing 20% inflation compared to your 5%. If we delay further, we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the higher inflation rate you're facing but also recognizes the need to settle soon to minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
