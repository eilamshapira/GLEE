"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the higher inflation rate affecting you, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This offer considers the diminishing value of money for both of us but leans slightly towards me due to the smaller impact of inflation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the higher inflation rate affecting me, I can still aim for a better split given that we have multiple rounds remaining. The difference in our inflation rates doesn't justify such a split in Bob's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering I'm facing 20% inflation compared to your 5%. If we delay further, we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the higher inflation rate you're facing but also recognizes the need to settle soon to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the significant inflation impact already (I've lost nearly half the potential value), and Bob's movement towards a more balanced split, accepting this offer is reasonable. Further delays would erode the value substantially for both of us, and the current split is close enough to fair to justify acceptance."
