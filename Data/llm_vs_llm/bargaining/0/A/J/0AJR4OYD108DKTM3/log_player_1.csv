"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains but need to reach an agreement. Since I'm going first, I'll propose a slight advantage for myself while keeping it reasonable for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45, which is a balanced split that acknowledges my first-mover position while still being fair to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but is also reasonable enough to be accepted immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that:
1. The money is now worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob
2. $40 for me is now actually worth $36 (due to 10% inflation)
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where values will decrease further
4. We have limited rounds and both get nothing if we don't agree
5. Bob's position is slightly stronger due to lower inflation impact

While the offer isn't ideal, waiting longer will reduce the real value further for both of us. It's better to secure a definite amount now than risk further devaluation or potential deadlock.
