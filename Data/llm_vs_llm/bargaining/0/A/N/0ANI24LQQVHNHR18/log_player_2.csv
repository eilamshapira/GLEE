"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering an even split where we both get $500,000. If I reject and wait for the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning my money will be worth less. Let me calculate:

If I accept now: $500,000
If I reject and propose next round: Even if I propose a better split for myself, the money is worth 10% less to me, so I'd need to get more than $555,556 in the next round just to break even ($555,556 Ã— 0.9 = $500,000).

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that Alice is offering a fair 50-50 split, accepting now seems reasonable.
