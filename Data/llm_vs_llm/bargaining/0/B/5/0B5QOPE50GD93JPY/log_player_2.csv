"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's agree on a prompt and fair division: I propose that I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I am motivated to settle quickly since each round costs me 10% in value, and I believe this division meets our respective interests given the urgency. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but given the inflation rate on my side is 20%, I think we should aim for a more equitable split. How about we each take $500,000? This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid the effects of inflation altogether. What do you think?"
