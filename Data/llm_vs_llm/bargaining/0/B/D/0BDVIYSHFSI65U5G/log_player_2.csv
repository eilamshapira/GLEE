"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less (so $1M becomes $900K)
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", 40% of the full amount now might be better than risking further negotiations with inflation

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation. Also, Alice might be even more resistant to accepting a better deal in later rounds.
