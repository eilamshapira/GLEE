"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate, I have some leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to potentially secure a deal early.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is fair given that Bob faces depreciation pressure in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. For Bob, his $5000 is actually only worth $4000 due to 20% inflation
3. For me, $5000 is still worth full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 3 where Bob's money will be worth even less (40% less than original)
5. This gives me more leverage in the next round, but also risks further negotiation

However, $5000 is still a good offer for me, and there's always a risk in prolonging negotiations. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
