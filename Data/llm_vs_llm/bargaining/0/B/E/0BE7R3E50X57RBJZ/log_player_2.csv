"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total.

Given the inflation penalty of 20% per round for me (but not for Alice), if I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth only 80% of the current value to me. That means rejecting now costs me 20% of potential value.

Since this is the first round and we have many rounds left, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This even split respects your interests while also being fair to me. Given the time pressure and inflation penalty that affects only me, this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a significant amount."
