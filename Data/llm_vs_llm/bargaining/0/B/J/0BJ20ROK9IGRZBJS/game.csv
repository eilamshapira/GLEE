400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, while I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, I'm taking on a larger risk in this negotiation. Let's be reasonable: I'll take $600000, leaving you with a still generous $400000.  We can avoid further inflation losses if you accept now.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was not balanced. Inflation is now reducing our total value by 20% compared to round 1. Let's be pragmatic - I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is fair considering I'm the first player and inflation affects us both equally. Accepting now prevents further losses for both of us.",Alice,3,
