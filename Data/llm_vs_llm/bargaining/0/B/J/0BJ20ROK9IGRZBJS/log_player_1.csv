"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, I'm taking on a larger risk in this negotiation. Let's be reasonable: I'll take $600000, leaving you with a still generous $400000.  We can avoid further inflation losses if you accept now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was not balanced. Inflation is now reducing our total value by 20% compared to round 1. Let's be pragmatic - I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is fair considering I'm the first player and inflation affects us both equally. Accepting now prevents further losses for both of us.""}"
