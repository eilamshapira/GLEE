Alice's offer:

{

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, I'm taking on a larger risk in this negotiation. Let's be reasonable: I'll take $600,000, leaving you with a still generous $400,000.  We can avoid further inflation losses if you accept now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was not balanced. Inflation is now reducing our total value by 20% compared to round 1. Let's be pragmatic - I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is fair considering I'm the first player and inflation affects us both equally. Accepting now prevents further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
