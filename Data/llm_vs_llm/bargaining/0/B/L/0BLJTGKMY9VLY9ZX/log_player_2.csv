"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider this offer carefully. If I reject it, I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 10% due to inflation (meaning the $100 would become worth $90 to me). 

Alice is offering me $40 now. If I reject and propose a better split for myself next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to more rounds and more inflation.

Given that I would lose 10% of the total value by rejecting, and $40 is a reasonable offer (40% of the pot), I'll accept.
