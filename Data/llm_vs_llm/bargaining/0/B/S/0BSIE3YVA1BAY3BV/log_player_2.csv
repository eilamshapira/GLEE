Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a good amount to start. Take it, or you'll get less later!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very uneven split offering me only 10% of the total amount. Since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal. Even with the 20% inflation per round, I can still aim for a more equitable distribution."
