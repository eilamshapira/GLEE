"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation is now affecting the value of the money. My money is worth less, and Bob's money is also worth less, but even more.

Given that I only have 11 rounds left and the value of my money continues to decrease with each round, I need to make a decision. Accepting Bob's offer of $4500 now is better than potentially getting nothing or even less in a later round.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
