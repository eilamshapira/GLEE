"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the 10% inflation rate that affects me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face. If we go to another round, I lose 10% value, so this split is actually quite favorable to you. Let's agree and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, and considering the inflation affects you more, I propose an even split of 5000$ each. This is fair given the circumstances, and it's a good chance for us to end this amicably before the value decreases further for you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
