"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face. If we go to another round, I lose 10% value, so this split is actually quite favorable to you. Let's agree and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, and considering the inflation affects you more, I propose an even split of 5000$ each. This is fair given the circumstances, and it's a good chance for us to end this amicably before the value decreases further for you.""
