"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take the lion's share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unbalanced. While Alice tries to frame it as being fair, taking 90% of the money is far from a reasonable split. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, keeping in mind that there's a 5% inflation penalty but we still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's be truly fair and split it 50-50. This way we both win equally and can finish the game quickly before inflation reduces our gains.""}"
