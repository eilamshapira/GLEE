"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that considers the inflation risk for me. Since I know I'll lose 10% value each round if Bob declines, I want to make an attractive first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting
3. If Bob declines, my next opportunity will be worth 10% less to me, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable first offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For me, due to 10% inflation, $500,000 is now worth $450,000 in round 1 value
2. My previous offer would have given me $550,000
3. This is a significant drop from what I proposed
4. However, if I reject, the next round will have another 10% inflation for me
5. If this continues, we might both end up with nothing after 12 rounds
6. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, even with the inflation effect

Since the inflation will continue to eat into both our shares and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
