Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
