"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, taking into account the inflation (20% for me, 5% for Alice), I need to consider that rejecting this offer in turn would mean I get even less in the next round. Therefore, I will try to propose a fair offer, slightly skewed in my favor but still acceptable for Alice.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""alice_gain"": 4800
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Another rejection would be disastrous. I need to make an offer that Alice can't refuse, even if it means I get less than I initially hoped for. Since I'm already at 36% loss and Alice is at 9.75%, I'll need to offer her something that compensates for that discrepancy and her effort.

{
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""alice_gain"": 5400
}
