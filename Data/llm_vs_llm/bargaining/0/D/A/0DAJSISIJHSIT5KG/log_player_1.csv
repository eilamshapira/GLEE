"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him, even accounting for the inflation difference.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more reasonable rather than risk the money losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

Reasoning:

* **Inflation:** I need to account for the money being worth less each round.
* **Bob's Position:**  His previous offer suggests he's aiming for a larger share, but it was highly unfair considering the inflation discrepancy.
* **Compromise:** I've increased my offer slightly from Round 1 to entice him while still securing a larger portion before inflation eats away at the value. 

I believe this offer is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see its value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is cutting it close, but I have to accept. 

* **Significant Inflation:** The money has lost almost half its value for me since the start. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers haven't become more generous, and he seems insistent on a larger share. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this, there's a high chance the next offer will be even worse due to inflation, leaving me with potentially less than $4500 in equivalent value. 

It's frustrating, but accepting is the most logical choice given the circumstances."
