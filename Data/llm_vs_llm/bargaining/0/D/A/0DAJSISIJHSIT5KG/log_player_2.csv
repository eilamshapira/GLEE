"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 3000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. 3000$ now is better than 3000$ next round
5. But this split (30-70) seems quite unfair

Since I can make a counter-offer next round and even with 5% inflation, I could potentially get a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. The money is now worth 5% less for me due to inflation
2. I want to make an offer that's likely to be accepted to avoid further inflation
3. A more balanced split would be fair, but slightly in my favor
4. 60-40 split might be reasonable given the inflation pressure

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this split because:
- It's more balanced than Alice's initial offer
- It gives Alice a substantial portion (4000$)
- If Alice rejects, she'll face uncertainty about future rounds
- The offer is fair enough that it should be appealing to accept"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from 3000$ to 3500$
2. The money is worth 9.75% less for me now
   * 3500$ now â‰ˆ 3159$ in round 1 value for me
3. Alice seems to be affected more severely by inflation (36%)
4. Her 6500$ is worth significantly less to her now
5. She might be feeling pressure to make a deal

However:
- 3159$ (in round 1 value) is still quite low
- Given Alice's higher inflation rate, I might get a better offer next round
- I can make a counter-offer next round
- Alice might be more willing to accept a fairer split given her higher inflation rate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically:

1. Money is worth even less now for both of us:
   - For me: about 15% less than round 1
   - For Alice: about 41% less than round 1
2. Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine
3. She should be more desperate to make a deal
4. However, I still need to make an attractive enough offer to get accepted

Given these factors, I'll make a slightly more moderate offer than last time:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer is strategic because:
- It's more generous than my last offer (6000/4000)
- Given Alice's high inflation rate, 4500$ now might be better for her than risking another round
- The split is still in my favor but more balanced
- It's a significant improvement over her last offer to me"
