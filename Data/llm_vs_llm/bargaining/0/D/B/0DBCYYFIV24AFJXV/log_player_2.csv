"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair when considering the inflation rates - if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value, but you lose more (10% per round vs my 5%). By accepting now, you maximize your actual value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
