"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to make a reasonable first offer that's not too greedy. Getting $550,000 now is better than risking multiple rounds where inflation will eat into the value, and Bob gets a substantial amount that might make them willing to accept rather than move to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even with the 5% inflation reduction, getting $950,000 (95% of $1,000,000 due to inflation) is significantly better than my initial proposal of $550,000. There's no guarantee that I would get a better deal in future rounds, and each round would reduce the value by another 5% for me. This is a very favorable offer despite the inflation penalty."
