50.0,50.0,Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation!,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to account for the inflation that only affects me. This way we both walk away with similar effective value, since I lose 5% each round due to inflation. This is fair since I'd get about 50 in effective value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Considering the inflation that affects you, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than I would have in Round 1, but not as large as you proposed. Let's find a middle ground.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"With inflation at nearly 10% affecting only me, I need a bit more to achieve fair effective value. At 53/47, I'd effectively get about 48 in purchasing power, which is closer to an even split in real terms. This accounts for the inflation penalty I face while you don't. Let's agree and avoid further inflation reducing our total value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
48.0,52.0,I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation you're facing. Let's agree on this and avoid further devaluation of our shares.,Alice,5,
