"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to account for the inflation that only affects me. This way we both walk away with similar effective value, since I lose 5% each round due to inflation. This is fair since I'd get about 50 in effective value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives him a larger share, and considering that the value of money for him decreases by 5% each round, I'll think about the potential future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's value decreases by 5% each round, and we're already in Round 3, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation that affects you, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than I would have in Round 1, but not as large as you proposed. Let's find a middle ground.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation at nearly 10% affecting only me, I need a bit more to achieve fair effective value. At 53/47, I'd effectively get about 48 in purchasing power, which is closer to an even split in real terms. This accounts for the inflation penalty I face while you don't. Let's agree and avoid further inflation reducing our total value. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer still gives him a larger share, and while I understand his point about inflation, I don't want to give up too much.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's value decreases by 5% each round, and we're already in Round 5, I'll try to make a reasonable offer that takes this into account. I'll give him a bit more than I would have initially, but still try to maintain a fair share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation you're facing. Let's agree on this and avoid further devaluation of our shares.""}"
