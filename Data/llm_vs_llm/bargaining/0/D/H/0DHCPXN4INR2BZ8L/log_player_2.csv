"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While an even split might seem fair, I should consider that Alice doesn't lose value to inflation, while I do. With each round, my purchasing power decreases by 5%. If I reject now, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, though the total will be worth slightly less to me.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and inflation only affects me, I'll make a counteroffer to try for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to account for the inflation that only affects me. This way we both walk away with similar effective value, since I lose 5% each round due to inflation. This is fair since I'd get about 50 in effective value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation that affects you, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than I would have in Round 1, but not as large as you proposed. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. The inflation is now at 9.75% for me, which means if I get $48, it's effectively worth about $43.32 to me. If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will increase to about 14.5%, further reducing the value of any money I receive.

Alice has offered me less than half, which doesn't fully account for the inflation penalty I face. However, if I reject again, I risk getting even less in real terms due to increasing inflation.

Since we have many rounds left and the inflation penalty compounds with each round, I should try for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""With inflation at nearly 10% affecting only me, I need a bit more to achieve fair effective value. At 53/47, I'd effectively get about 48 in purchasing power, which is closer to an even split in real terms. This accounts for the inflation penalty I face while you don't. Let's agree and avoid further inflation reducing our total value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation you're facing. Let's agree on this and avoid further devaluation of our shares. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","At this point, inflation has reached 18.55% for me. If I accept Alice's offer of $52, it's actually worth about $42.35 to me in real terms ($52 Ã— 0.8145). 

Alice has finally offered me more than half of the money, recognizing the inflation penalty I face. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances:
- If I reject again, inflation will continue to reduce my purchasing power further
- We're now in round 5 of 12, so continued rejection risks significant erosion of value
- Alice has moved from offering 48 to 52, showing willingness to compromise

This offer gives me effectively less than half in real terms, but it's much better than continuing the negotiation and losing more to inflation.
