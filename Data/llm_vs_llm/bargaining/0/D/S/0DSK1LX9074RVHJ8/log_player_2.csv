"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * Only 10% less for Alice
   * But I get to make the next offer

While the split isn't even (60-40 in Alice's favor), the inflation penalty is significant. If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 for me in the next round, making it harder to get a better deal than the current $4,000 offer.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and that Alice has a lower inflation penalty, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
