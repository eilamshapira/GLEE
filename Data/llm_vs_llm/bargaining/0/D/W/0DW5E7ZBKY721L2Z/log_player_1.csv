"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation affects me more severely (10% vs 5% per round). Since time pressure affects me more, I should propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's make a quick deal and avoid losing value to inflation. I propose a reasonable split that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to avoid further losses due to inflation. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $500,000 is worth $450,000 (10% less)
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth $475,000 (5% less)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but everything will be worth even less
   * The inflation difference (10% vs 5%) puts me at a disadvantage the longer this goes

3. This is a reasonable offer considering:
   * It's a fair 50-50 split of the nominal amount
   * While I get slightly less real value due to higher inflation, the difference isn't huge
   * Prolonging negotiations will only decrease both our values
