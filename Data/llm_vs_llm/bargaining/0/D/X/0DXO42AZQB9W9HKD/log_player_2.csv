"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The total amount is $10,000, and Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) while keeping $6,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less ($9,500). While I could try to get a better deal, there's a risk of losing more value through further negotiations.

$4,000 is a substantial amount, even though it's not an even split. Getting a guaranteed $4,000 now might be better than risking a negotiation where the total pie shrinks.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances making a counter-offer in the next round, as I believe I deserve a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance. Given that the money is already worth 5% less (effectively $9,500 now), we should both be motivated to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50-50 division
2. Still gives Alice a slight advantage ($500 more)
3. Better for both of us to agree now than lose another 5% in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4375 
# Alice gain: 5625 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer...

Alice has improved her offer from the first round:
- First offer: $4,000 for me, $6,000 for her
- Current offer: $4,375 for me, $5,625 for her

Even though the money is worth 9.75% less now, this is actually a better split ratio than before. The split is now closer to 44/56 instead of the initial 40/60.

If I reject, we'll lose another 5% in the next round, bringing the total depreciation to nearly 15%. That would significantly reduce the real value for both of us.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in both of us losing more value due to inflation."
