"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This gives me a larger share while still offering Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I believe we can reach a more equitable split. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a more balanced split: I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fairer offer that moves closer to an even division while still giving me a small advantage."
