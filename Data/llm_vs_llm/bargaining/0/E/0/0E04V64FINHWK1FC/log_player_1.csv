Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, and 20% less than in the second round, making it worth 64% of its original value. I don't know how inflation affects Bob, but I will assume it's similar for strategic purposes.

Given the situation, I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to me, considering the diminishing value of money over time.
