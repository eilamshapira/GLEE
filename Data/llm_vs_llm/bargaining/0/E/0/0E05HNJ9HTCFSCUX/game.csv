475000.0,525000.0,"I'm proposing a fair split where I get $525000 and you get $475000. I've rejected your 60-40 split because I face 5% inflation per round, meaning I need a better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer is more equitable given our different situations, and accepting now means we both avoid further devaluation of the total amount.",Bob,2,
