"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair split where I get $525000 and you get $475000. I've rejected your 60-40 split because I face 5% inflation per round, meaning I need a better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer is more equitable given our different situations, and accepting now means we both avoid further devaluation of the total amount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
