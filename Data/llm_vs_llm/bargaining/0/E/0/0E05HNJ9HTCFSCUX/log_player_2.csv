"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game's dynamics. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which means I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $400,000 in the next round to come out ahead, accounting for the 5% inflation. I'd need to get at least $421,053 in the next round to break even with what I'm offered now.

Given that I can make the offer in the next round and potentially get a better deal despite the inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split where I get $525,000 and you get $475,000. I've rejected your 60-40 split because I face 5% inflation per round, meaning I need a better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer is more equitable given our different situations, and accepting now means we both avoid further devaluation of the total amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the game's dynamics and your inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $450,000 with a 55-45 split in her favor. Since we're in round 3, I'm facing 9.75% inflation on my gains, which means the $450,000 is actually worth about $406,125 to me (450,000 Ã— 0.9025).

If I reject and move to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (approximately 14.26% from the original value), making the next round's money worth only about 85.74% of the original value to me.

If I make a counter-offer in round 4, I'd need to secure significantly more than $450,000 to compensate for the additional inflation. Specifically, I'd need at least $470,000 in the next round to match what I'm being offered now.

Given that Alice hasn't budged much from her original position (just 5% more in my favor), and the increasing inflation pressure I face, accepting this offer is the more prudent choice. Further negotiation would likely erode my potential gains due to inflation.
