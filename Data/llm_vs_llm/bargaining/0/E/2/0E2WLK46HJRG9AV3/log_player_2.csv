"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money 60/40. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
2. Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   - Even if I propose a better split, she might reject
4. $40 right now is better than a risky negotiation with inflation

While the split isn't completely equal, it's a reasonable opening offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
