"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a solid $40 while being fair to both of us. Keep in mind that if we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me, making the total worth only $80 to me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
