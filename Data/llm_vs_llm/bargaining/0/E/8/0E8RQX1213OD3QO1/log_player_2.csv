"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a solid $40 while being fair to both of us. Keep in mind that if we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me, making the total worth only $80 to me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
