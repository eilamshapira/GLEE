"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I need to consider the effects of inflation. In round 1, I'm making the offer.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40}
```
Rationale:

*   **Alice's Perspective:** I'm aiming for a larger share initially because I know the value of the money diminishes for me faster than for Bob.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Offering Bob $40 might be acceptable in the first round, as his money only depreciates by 5% each round, but if I delay, the total amount of money decreases for me substantially.
*   **Fairness (somewhat):** Offering a split that gives me a slightly larger portion could be seen as somewhat fair, giving a chance for the game to end in round one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 2, taking inflation into account.

*   **Nominal Values:** Bob offers me $45 and keeps $55.
*   **Inflation Adjusted Value for Alice:** My money is worth 20% less than in round 1. Therefore, $45 in this round is worth $45 * 0.8 = $36 of round 1's money.
*   **Inflation Adjusted Value for Bob:** Bob's money is worth 5% less than in round 1. Therefore, $55 in this round is worth $55 * 0.95 = $52.25 of round 1's money.

If I reject this offer, I will propose an offer in round 3 that will likely be rejected by Bob, and the total money will decrease more.
The total worth to both players is $36+$52.25=$88.25
