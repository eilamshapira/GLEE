Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is getting worse for me. I need to push for a more equitable split before the value diminishes further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly to incentivize Alice while the amount is still significantly impacted by inflation for both of us."
