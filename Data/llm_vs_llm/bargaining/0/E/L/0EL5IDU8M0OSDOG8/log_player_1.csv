Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I realize that if you wait until round 3 you’ll propose a split that awards you nearly all of the $100, while my share suffers further from inflation. To avoid dragging this out (and further eroding my value), I’m offering you the full $100 right now. I hope you agree to settle quickly for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Even though it seems heavily skewed in my favor to wait, Bob is right. If I reject this, he'll likely offer me a tiny amount in Round 3, knowing that I'll have to accept to avoid getting $0 in Round 4.  This offer is the best outcome I can realistically achieve."
