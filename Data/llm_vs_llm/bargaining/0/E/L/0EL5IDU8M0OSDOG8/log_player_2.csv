Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 0, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Alice, I realize that if you wait until round 3 you’ll propose a split that awards you nearly all of the $100, while my share suffers further from inflation. To avoid dragging this out (and further eroding my value), I’m offering you the full $100 right now. I hope you agree to settle quickly for our mutual benefit.""}"
