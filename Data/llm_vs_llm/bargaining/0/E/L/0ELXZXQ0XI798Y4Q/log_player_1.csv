"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send an offer to Bob that I think is fair, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split in our favor. Since I know I face 10% inflation per round, I'm offering a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging I need to secure a bit more to offset potential future inflation if we go to additional rounds."
