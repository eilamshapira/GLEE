"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose we split the money this way since I initiated the offer. It's a fair start, considering we can negotiate. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $950,000 (keeping most for myself)
   * But that would likely be rejected by Alice
   * My $400,000 now is better than $500,000 in the next round with 5% inflation

While Alice's offer isn't a 50-50 split, $400,000 is still a significant amount. If I reject, the 5% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more in the next round just to break even. Given the uncertainty of Alice's acceptance and the guaranteed loss from inflation, I should accept this offer.
