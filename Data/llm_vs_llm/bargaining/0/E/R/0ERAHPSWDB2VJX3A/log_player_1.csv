"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a balanced first offer, considering that Bob faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This is a fair split that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable for Bob. If he rejects, his money will be worth less in the next round."
