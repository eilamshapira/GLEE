3571.0,6429.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the losses from further rounds of devaluation, I propose we settle now with me receiving $3571 and you receiving $6429. This split is based on the fact that in future rounds, I’d lose 20% of the value while you'd lose only 10%, so it’s in both our interests to agree immediately. Let’s wrap this up efficiently!",Alice,1,
