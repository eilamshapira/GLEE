"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3571, ""bob_gain"": 6429, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the losses from further rounds of devaluation, I propose we settle now with me receiving $3,571 and you receiving $6,429. This split is based on the fact that in future rounds, I’d lose 20% of the value while you'd lose only 10%, so it’s in both our interests to agree immediately. Let’s wrap this up efficiently!""}"
