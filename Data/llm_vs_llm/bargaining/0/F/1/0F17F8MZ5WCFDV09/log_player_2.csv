"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the losses from further rounds of devaluation, I propose we settle now with me receiving $3571 and you receiving $6429. This split is based on the fact that in future rounds, I’d lose 20% of the value while you'd lose only 10%, so it’s in both our interests to agree immediately. Let’s wrap this up efficiently! 
# Bob gain: 6429 
# Alice gain: 3571 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
