60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 20% depreciation per round, taking this offer now is better than waiting.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think 60-40 is unfair given the depreciation I face. Meet me in the middle at 55-45.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 20% depreciation you face, your $35 now is worth about the same as $44 would have been in round 1. This is actually a fair deal considering the time that has passed.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Your math is correct, but I still think I deserve more. I'll compromise at 52-48, considering the depreciation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the compounding 20% depreciation, your $30 now is worth about the same as $52 would have been in round 1. Further delays will only reduce the real value of your share. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"I understand the math, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll propose a 50-50 split, considering we're already halfway through the rounds.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7 and your depreciation has reached over 67%. Your $25 now would have been equivalent to about $76 in round 1. If we continue further, the depreciation will make any amount worth even less to you. This is actually generous given the circumstances.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
52.0,48.0,"I know the depreciation is high, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll propose a 48-52 split, hoping we can meet in the middle before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, we only have 4 rounds left. Due to the nearly 80% depreciation, your $15 now is worth about the same as $71 in round 1. If we reach the final rounds, any amount will be worth virtually nothing to you. This offer is still meaningful compared to waiting longer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
55.0,45.0,"I know I'm taking a huge risk, but I'm not willing to settle for $15. I'll propose a 45-55 split, hoping you'll see the value in ending this game sooner rather than later.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. With 86.58% depreciation, even $45 would only be worth about $6 to you now. We have just one more round after this - if we don't agree, we both get nothing. This $10 is still better than zero, which is what we'll both get if we reach round 12 without agreement.",Alice,11,
