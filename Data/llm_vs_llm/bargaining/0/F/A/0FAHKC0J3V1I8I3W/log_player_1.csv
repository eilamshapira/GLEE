"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I need to be mindful of potential inflation if we go to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split of 55-45. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, it's important that we reach an agreement. This offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal while still ensuring I receive a fair portion considering the inflation risk I face."
