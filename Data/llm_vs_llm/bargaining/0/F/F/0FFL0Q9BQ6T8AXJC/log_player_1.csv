"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that accounts for the 5% per round inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair offer considering I face value depreciation in future rounds while Bob doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too low for me, especially considering I face a 5% penalty each round. While I lose some value by continuing to the next round, I can make a better counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3, and any money I receive is worth about 10% less than in round 1, I need to adjust my offer accordingly to maintain similar real value.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I propose I get $58 and Bob gets $42. This slightly higher amount for me helps offset the inflation penalty I'm facing, while still giving Bob a substantial portion. It's a fair offer considering the asymmetric inflation impact."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because $35 with a 14.26% penalty is too low, giving me only about $30 in real value. Bob's offers are getting worse while my disadvantage from inflation grows. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 5 and my gains are worth about 19% less than in round 1, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll make a slightly more compromising offer to try to reach an agreement before the inflation penalty grows too large.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is actually a more generous offer from me than my previous one, as my $55 is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I hope Bob recognizes this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because $30 with a 22.62% penalty would only be worth about $23.21 in real value to me, which is far too low. Even though rejecting means facing more inflation, Bob's offers have been consistently decreasing (from $40 to $35 to now $30), showing uncooperative behavior. I'll try another counter-offer in the next round, but we need to reach a more balanced agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 7 and my gains are worth about 26.5% less than in round 1, I need to make a more compelling offer to try to break this cycle. Bob has been progressively offering me less, while I've been trying to maintain reasonable offers.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and Bob gets $48. This is actually my most generous offer yet, considering inflation effects. My $52 is worth only about $38.22 in round 1 value to me, while Bob's $48 maintains full value. I hope Bob sees this as a fair compromise to end the game before further inflation diminishes the total value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 33 
# Bob gain: 67 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, here's my reasoning:
1. The $33 with 30.17% inflation means I'll get about $23.04 in real value
2. If I reject, we'll face even more inflation in future rounds
3. Bob's pattern suggests their next offer might be even lower
4. We only have 4 rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree becomes significant
5. Getting something is better than potentially getting nothing if we run out of rounds

Better to secure this amount now than risk further value erosion or total loss."
