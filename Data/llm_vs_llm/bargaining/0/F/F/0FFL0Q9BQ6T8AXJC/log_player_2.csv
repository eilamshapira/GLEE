"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 45/55 split, where I get $45 and she gets $55.

Let me analyze this situation. With each round, the money loses 5% of its value for Alice, but maintains full value for me. This gives me some leverage in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, Alice may be more willing to accept a better deal for me in the next round, since her share would be worth less to her if we keep going.

I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this initial offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more favorable counteroffer while still being reasonable. Since the money loses 5% value for Alice each round, she has some incentive to agree sooner rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives me a better share while still offering Alice a substantial amount that will be worth more to her now than waiting for future rounds where her value would decrease."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has actually offered me less than her initial proposal (down from $45 to $42), while increasing her own share. This suggests she's not recognizing the weakening of her position due to the inflation affecting only her side.

Since the money maintains its full value for me across all rounds, but continues to lose value for Alice (now almost 10% less valuable for her), I have an incentive to continue negotiating for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a firm but fair counteroffer. The inflation factor is increasing with each round, putting more pressure on Alice to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. Alice should recognize that her position weakens with each round due to the 5% inflation on her side. This offer still gives her a significant amount that will be worth more to her now than a potentially larger amount in later rounds after more inflation has occurred."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now returned to offering me $45, which is the same as her initial offer in round 1. However, her position has weakened significantly - the money is now worth 18.55% less to her than in round 1.

Given that we've gone through multiple rounds and the inflation penalty for Alice continues to increase, I should continue negotiating for a better split. With each passing round, Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement since the money becomes less valuable to her.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 6 and Alice is experiencing significant inflation (over 18% already), I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer while still leaving room for negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. At this point, Alice should recognize that her position weakens with each round due to the 5% inflation on her side. The money will continue to lose value for her with each rejection, so this $30 now is worth more to her than potentially more money several rounds later after more inflation has occurred. As we've reached the halfway point of our 12 possible rounds, it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer to me, now offering $48 instead of the previous $45. However, the money has continued to lose value for her - it's now worth 26.49% less to her than in round 1.

While she's showing some movement in my direction, this is still not a great offer considering the significant inflation penalty she's facing. With only 5 rounds remaining after this one, and inflation continuing to reduce the value for Alice, I have leverage to continue negotiating.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 8 of 12, and Alice is facing significant inflation of over 26%. Since we only have a few rounds left and Alice's position continues to weaken with each round, I'll adjust my offer to try to reach an agreement while still securing a good outcome for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 67, ""alice_gain"": 33}

I propose a 67/33 split. This is slightly more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good position for myself. With the inflation at over 26% for Alice, $33 now is worth significantly more to her than waiting for future rounds where the value will continue to decrease. We're two-thirds through our negotiation period, so finding agreement soon benefits both of us to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
