"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that she gets $5,500 and I get $4,500. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me. For Alice, it would be worth $9,500 since her inflation rate is 5%.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I would need to propose something that Alice would accept, considering her 5% inflation rate. She might not accept less than what she's currently offering me.

Given the inflation rates, I think this initial offer is reasonable. If we continue to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, and I'm affected more by the inflation.
