"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This offer is very unfair, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Even with 5% inflation per round, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. In the next round, I can make a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Rationale (not shown to human): I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. Even though I'm under time pressure due to inflation, starting with an equal split is a strong negotiating position. If Alice rejects this, they would face inflation in the next round, which might make them more likely to accept a fair offer now. The 50-50 split is also a commonly accepted fair division that often leads to agreement in negotiation games."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not shown): This is a reasonable offer to accept now because:
1. The 400k/600k split is much fairer than the initial 100k/900k offer
2. Due to inflation, my 400k is now worth about 361k (9.75% less), and waiting another round would reduce it by another 5%
3. Alice seems to be under even more inflation pressure (19%)
4. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes given the accelerating inflation for both parties
5. This is a reasonable compromise from both the initial unfair offer and my 50-50 proposal"
