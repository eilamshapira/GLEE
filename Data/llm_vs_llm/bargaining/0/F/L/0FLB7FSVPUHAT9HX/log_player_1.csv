"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a split of the money where I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the time pressure I face due to inflation. The longer we negotiate, the less valuable the money becomes for me, so I'm offering a reasonable division that should be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
