"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value of the money in future rounds. I'll aim for a split that is favorable to me but also likely to be accepted by Bob to avoid the risk of further devaluation.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation:

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this because:

*   It still gives Bob a significant amount ($4000).
*   Bob might be worried about inflation in future rounds.
*   It is the first round, and Bob might consider future rounds uncertain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and now he's making a proposal. The money is worth 20% less than in round 1, so the $3500 he's offering is actually worth $3500 * 0.8 = $2800 in round 1 dollars.

Let's consider what would happen if I reject. In round 3, I get to make the offer, but the money will be worth 40% less than in round 1. So, even if I propose a split where I get $7000 in round 3, it would only be worth $7000 * 0.6 = $4200 in round 1 dollars.

Bob is offering me $3500 now, which is equivalent to $2800 in round 1 dollars. It's not ideal, but it's better than the potential $4200 (in round 1 dollars) I could get in round 3, which is also assuming Bob accepts my proposal in round 3. Also, there is a risk that Bob will reject my proposal in round 3.

Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
