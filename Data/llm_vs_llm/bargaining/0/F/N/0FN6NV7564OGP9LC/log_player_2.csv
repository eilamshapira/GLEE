"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly—$50 each—right from the start. Accepting now secures our full shares before any inflation reduces the value (at least for me). Looking forward to your quick agreement so we both come out fairly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable.

Since the instructions mention there's 0% inflation for me, waiting won't reduce the value of my share. However, Alice is hinting that she might face inflation on her end, which could make her more desperate in later rounds.

There are 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get nothing. A 50-50 split is already perfectly fair, and there's no strategic advantage for me to reject this offer since:
1. I won't gain more value by waiting (0% inflation)
2. There's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement
3. Future negotiations could become more complex
