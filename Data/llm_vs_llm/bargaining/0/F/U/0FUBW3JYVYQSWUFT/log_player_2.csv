"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with significant value, and we don't risk losing money to inflation in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. 

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but the total amount will be reduced by 10% due to inflation (down to $900,000). This means even if I proposed to take everything in the next round, I'd get at most $900,000 (and Alice would likely reject that).

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now avoids the risk of continued negotiations where we both lose value to inflation.
