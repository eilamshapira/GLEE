This is a tough decision point. Bob's offers are getting closer to a more ""fair"" split, but the rate of his devaluation is also increasing.  I'm still banking on him becoming more agreeable as the rounds progress."

It's getting risky now. Bob's devaluation is significant, but this offer gives me a slight advantage, and we're running out of rounds.  Better to take a decent offer now than risk getting nothing."
