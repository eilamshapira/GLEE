550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's finish this quickly to maximize value for both of us.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I don't face that penalty while you lose 5% each round. This actually gives me a stronger position. However, I'm proposing a fair split that's tilted slightly in my favor given this dynamic. If we conclude now, you'll get $450000 which is better than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation due to your inflation penalty. Let's finalize this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, while you're right about having a stronger position due to inflation, I'm still early enough in the negotiation to seek a better deal. My 5% penalty means I need a larger share now to achieve fair value. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while protecting me from inflation effects.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I notice you actually decreased your offer to me despite your worsening position due to inflation. Let's be practical - with each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and you've already lost nearly 10% to inflation. My offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than a larger nominal amount several rounds later. If we continue negotiating, your position only weakens. This is a reasonable offer given the asymmetric inflation pressure you face.",Bob,4,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to better reflect our positions. Yes, I face inflation pressure, but we're still early enough that I shouldn't accept a too unfavorable split. This offer of $575k to me and $425k to you accounts for both my inflation penalty and your stronger position. It's a reasonable compromise that lets us both walk away with a good outcome.",Alice,5,

375000.0,625000.0,"Alice, I appreciate that you've improved your offer, which shows you understand the impact of inflation on your position. However, we need to be realistic about the dynamics here. We're now in round 6, and your share has already lost over 18% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your position will deteriorate significantly. My offer of $375000 to you now is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of inflation. This split acknowledges both the time pressure you face and the fact that I don't lose value through inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation now - further delays will only reduce the real value of your share.",Bob,6,
