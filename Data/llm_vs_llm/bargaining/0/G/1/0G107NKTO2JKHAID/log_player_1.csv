Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I don't face that penalty while you lose 5% each round. This actually gives me a stronger position. However, I'm proposing a fair split that's tilted slightly in my favor given this dynamic. If we conclude now, you'll get $450000 which is better than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation due to your inflation penalty. Let's finalize this now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty means I should be aggressive early. While Bob's logic about his stronger position is sound, we still have 10 rounds left and the current 5% penalty isn't severe enough to force my hand. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects the time pressure I face."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you actually decreased your offer to me despite your worsening position due to inflation. Let's be practical - with each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and you've already lost nearly 10% to inflation. My offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than a larger nominal amount several rounds later. If we continue negotiating, your position only weakens. This is a reasonable offer given the asymmetric inflation pressure you face. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob's logic about the inflation pressure is correct, at round 4 I've only lost about 14% to inflation. Even though my position weakens each round, getting $400,000 now (worth about $343,000 after inflation) is still less favorable than continuing to negotiate. I'll make another offer that better accounts for our relative positions while there's still time."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to better reflect our positions. Yes, I face inflation pressure, but we're still early enough that I shouldn't accept a too unfavorable split. This offer of $575k to me and $425k to you accounts for both my inflation penalty and your stronger position. It's a reasonable compromise that lets us both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that you've improved your offer, which shows you understand the impact of inflation on your position. However, we need to be realistic about the dynamics here. We're now in round 6, and your share has already lost over 18% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your position will deteriorate significantly. My offer of $375000 to you now is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of inflation. This split acknowledges both the time pressure you face and the fact that I don't lose value through inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation now - further delays will only reduce the real value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's logic is sound at this point. With a 22.62% inflation penalty, my $375,000 is worth about $290,175 in real terms, and if we continue negotiating, my position will only weaken further. While not ideal, this is likely better than what I could achieve in later rounds given the increasing inflation penalty. Better to accept now than risk further value erosion."
