"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's finish this quickly to maximize value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000, citing her 5% inflation penalty per round as justification.

Let me analyze this situation:
- If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round
- Alice faces 5% inflation per round, while I face 0%
- This means waiting is costlier for Alice than for me
- We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

Given that Alice faces inflation while I don't, I have a strategic advantage by waiting. If I reject this offer, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. Since Alice's money loses value each round, she has increasing incentive to accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's inflation concern while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I don't face that penalty while you lose 5% each round. This actually gives me a stronger position. However, I'm proposing a fair split that's tilted slightly in my favor given this dynamic. If we conclude now, you'll get $450,000 which is better than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation due to your inflation penalty. Let's finalize this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while you're right about having a stronger position due to inflation, I'm still early enough in the negotiation to seek a better deal. My 5% penalty means I need a larger share now to achieve fair value. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while protecting me from inflation effects. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

Alice has actually worsened her offer to me (from $450,000 to $400,000) despite facing inflation. This suggests she's testing how aggressively I'll negotiate.

Let me consider the dynamics:
- We're only in round 3 of 12 possible rounds
- Alice's money is now worth 9.75% less than round 1
- My money retains full value regardless of round
- Her bargaining position weakens with each round

Given that Alice faces increasing pressure with each round due to inflation, while I don't, I have incentive to continue negotiating. She's trying to get a better deal, but time works against her strategically.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I notice you actually decreased your offer to me despite your worsening position due to inflation. Let's be practical - with each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and you've already lost nearly 10% to inflation. My offer gives you $400,000 now, which is worth more than a larger nominal amount several rounds later. If we continue negotiating, your position only weakens. This is a reasonable offer given the asymmetric inflation pressure you face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to better reflect our positions. Yes, I face inflation pressure, but we're still early enough that I shouldn't accept a too unfavorable split. This offer of $575k to me and $425k to you accounts for both my inflation penalty and your stronger position. It's a reasonable compromise that lets us both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer where I would get $425,000 and she would get $575,000.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- We're now in round 5 of 12
- Alice's money has already lost 18.55% of its value since round 1
- My money retains full value regardless of round
- Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $425,000 for me

Alice is starting to concede more as inflation erodes her position, but she's still asking for a larger share ($575,000 vs my $425,000). Given that we're not even halfway through the possible rounds and my bargaining position continues to strengthen with each round, I can still improve my outcome.

The inflation pressure on Alice will increase further in subsequent rounds, which should lead to better offers for me.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 625000, 
""alice_gain"": 375000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate that you've improved your offer, which shows you understand the impact of inflation on your position. However, we need to be realistic about the dynamics here. We're now in round 6, and your share has already lost over 18% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your position will deteriorate significantly. My offer of $375,000 to you now is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of inflation. This split acknowledges both the time pressure you face and the fact that I don't lose value through inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation now - further delays will only reduce the real value of your share.""}"
