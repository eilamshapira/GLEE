"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But due to 20% inflation, if I reject, the $5000 would be worth only $4000 to me in the next round
4. Even if I make a more favorable offer next round, the inflation penalty means I'm likely to end up with less value

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fair nature of the current offer, I should accept.
