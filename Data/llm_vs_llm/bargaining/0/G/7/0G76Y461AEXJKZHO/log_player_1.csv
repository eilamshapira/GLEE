"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. Still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The original amount I would get is $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

I don't think this is a fair deal, so I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the 3rd round, the total depreciation is 20% + 20% = 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8).

The original amount of $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400 to me.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the depreciated value. I'll offer Bob $4,000, which is roughly 62.5% of the original $10,000, adjusted for the depreciation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split. Let's settle before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, my offer is getting better for you by the minute. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

For Round 4, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means it's worth $10,000 * 0.512 = $5,120 to me in terms of original value.

Bob's offer gives me $3,500, but considering the inflation, the actual value to me is $3,500 * 0.512 = $1,792.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially since Bob's offer is getting more skewed in his favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me in the 4th round, and now we're in the 5th round, the total depreciation is 20% + 20% + 20% + 20% = 59.2% (1 - 0.8^4), but to calculate the actual depreciation I should use 1 - (0.8^4) = 0.5904, so 1 - 0.5904 = 0.4096 or 59.04% less, the money I get is now worth 40.96% of its original value.

The original amount of $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.4096 = $4,096 to me.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the depreciated value. I'll offer Bob $5,500, which leaves me with $4,500.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is killing me. Let's settle before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous at this point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's rejection again.

For Round 6, the money I gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which means it's worth $10,000 * 0.3277 = $3,277 to me in terms of original value.

Bob's offer gives me $3,000, but considering the inflation, the actual value to me is $3,000 * 0.3277 = $983.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and Bob's offer, although seemingly low, is actually a significant portion of the remaining value to me.

However, I still think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less for me in the 6th round, and now we're in the 7th round, the total depreciation is even higher. To calculate it: 
1 - (0.8^6) = 0.6746 or 67.46% less, the money I get is now worth 32.54% of its original value, but to get the actual depreciation for this round I should calculate 1 - (0.8^7) = 0.7634 or 76.34% less, so the money I get is now worth 23.66% of its original value.

The original amount of $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.2366 = $2,366 to me.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the depreciated value. I'll offer Bob $6,000, which leaves me with $4,000.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is crippling me, let's end this before I'm left with nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm the only one who can save you from total loss. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's rejection again.

For Round 8, the money I gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round, which means it's worth $10,000 * 0.2097 = $2,097 to me in terms of original value.

Bob's offer gives me $2,500, but considering the inflation, the actual value to me is $2,500 * 0.2097 = $524.

At this point, I'm desperate to get something out of this deal. Bob's offer, although extremely low, is still better than nothing.

I think it's time to reconsider my strategy and accept an offer that, although unfavorable, is better than losing everything.
