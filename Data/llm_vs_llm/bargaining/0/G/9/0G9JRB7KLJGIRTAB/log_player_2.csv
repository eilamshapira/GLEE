"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the negotiation advantage of going first. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal for a 60-40 split where I would receive $400,000.

While Alice does have the first-mover advantage, a 50-50 split would be more equitable. Since I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, and we have plenty of rounds remaining (this is only round 1 of 12), I'll reject this offer to propose a more balanced division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is the most fair and equitable solution for both of us. This gives us each half a million dollars, which is a substantial amount. There's no reason either of us should receive more than the other in this situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I understand your perspective, so I'm willing to adjust my offer. How about a 55-45 split? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's revised proposal of a 55-45 split where I would receive $450,000.

While this is an improvement from her initial offer, we're still early in the negotiation (round 3 of 12), and I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. Since I'll have another opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this offer to continue negotiating toward a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Thank you for moving toward a more balanced split. I appreciate the progress we're making. I'm proposing a 48-52 split in your favor, which is very close to equal while still giving you a slight advantage. This seems like a fair compromise that recognizes your first-mover position while still being equitable for both of us.""}"
