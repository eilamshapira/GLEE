5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob! Since the money loses 10% of its value for you each round but stays the same for me, we're both better off deciding now rather than later. I'm offering you $4500 which is fair given the circumstances - if we go to another round, your share would effectively be worth less to you.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation affects my side.  Let's be reasonable and close this out.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. Due to the 10% inflation penalty you face each round, your $5000 from last round is now effectively worth only $4500 to you. I'm offering you $4000 now, which means we both compromise from our initial positions. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable deal considering the time pressure you face.",Alice,3,
