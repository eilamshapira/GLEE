"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Bob more than me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since the money loses 10% of its value for you each round but stays the same for me, we're both better off deciding now rather than later. I'm offering you $4,500 which is fair given the circumstances - if we go to another round, your share would effectively be worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation affects my side.  Let's be reasonable and close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. Due to the 10% inflation penalty you face each round, your $5000 from last round is now effectively worth only $4500 to you. I'm offering you $4000 now, which means we both compromise from our initial positions. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable deal considering the time pressure you face.""}"
