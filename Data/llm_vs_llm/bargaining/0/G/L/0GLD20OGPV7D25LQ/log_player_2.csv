"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since the money loses 10% of its value for you each round but stays the same for me, we're both better off deciding now rather than later. I'm offering you $4500 which is fair given the circumstances - if we go to another round, your share would effectively be worth less to you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation affects my side.  Let's be reasonable and close this out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. Due to the 10% inflation penalty you face each round, your $5000 from last round is now effectively worth only $4500 to you. I'm offering you $4000 now, which means we both compromise from our initial positions. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable deal considering the time pressure you face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
