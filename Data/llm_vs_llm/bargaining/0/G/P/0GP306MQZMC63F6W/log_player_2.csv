"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose value with each round, let's split it evenly at 5000 each and avoid losing money to inflation. This is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
2. Alice's money devalues more slowly than mine (5% vs 10% per round)
3. This gives me some leverage to ask for more than 50%

With my 10% inflation rate, waiting one round means my share would need to be about 5,555$ to equal today's 5,000$.
Alice's inflation is only 5%, so she might be more willing to wait.

However, the risk of extended negotiations could leave us both with nothing after 12 rounds. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

Given these factors, I'll accept this fair first offer rather than risk losing value to inflation in negotiations.
