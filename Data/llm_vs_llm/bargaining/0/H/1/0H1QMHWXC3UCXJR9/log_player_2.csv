"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me each round, my offer needs to reflect that. In round 2, the value of $1,000,000 is worth 80% of its original value to me. This means my effective money is $800,000.

Therefore, my offer:
```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's calculate the values again. The money's value to me is now significantly reduced.

*   **Round 1 Value for me:** $1,000,000
*   **Round 2 Value for me:** $800,000 (80% of Round 1)
*   **Round 3 Value for me:** $640,000 (80% of Round 2)
*   **Round 4 Value for me:** $512,000 (80% of Round 3)

I need to offer something that, to me, is greater than what I would expect to get if I rejected.

Therefore, my offer is:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000}
```"
