55.0,45.0,Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher portion for myself because I know I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round. This way we can both walk away with a fair share right now instead of losing value through delays.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we can settle quickly and minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand we both face inflation, but yours is significantly higher at 20% per round versus my 5%. If we don't agree now, your next round's value will drop even more. This 60-40 split actually gives you more real value than waiting another round. Let's finalize this deal now to minimize our collective losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 36% less value than in round 1, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer considers the urgency to settle and minimize further loss in real value for both of us. Let's end this now before it gets worse.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, we need to come to an agreement quickly. Your money is devaluing much faster than mine (nearly 50% already vs. my 14%). If we continue to the next round, your share will lose even more value. This 65-35 split actually gives you more purchasing power than waiting another round where you'd face even steeper inflation. Let's finalize this now to protect both our interests.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, with my share now worth 59.04% less than in round 1, and facing even steeper inflation next round, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This is our chance to settle before my share loses even more value. Let's agree now to protect what we can of our shares.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7, and your money has lost over 67% of its value while mine has only lost about 23%. If we go to round 8, your share will be worth even less. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than waiting another round with your extremely high inflation rate. Let's end this negotiation now before your share becomes almost worthless.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're now in round 8, and my share is worth 73.79% less than in round 1. Given the drastic inflation I'm facing, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This is our last chance to settle before my share becomes nearly worthless. Let's agree now to salvage what we can.",Bob,8,
