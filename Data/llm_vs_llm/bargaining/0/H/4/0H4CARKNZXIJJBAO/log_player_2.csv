"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher portion for myself because I know I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round. This way we can both walk away with a fair share right now instead of losing value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we both face inflation, but yours is significantly higher at 20% per round versus my 5%. If we don't agree now, your next round's value will drop even more. This 60-40 split actually gives you more real value than waiting another round. Let's finalize this deal now to minimize our collective losses.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to come to an agreement quickly. Your money is devaluing much faster than mine (nearly 50% already vs. my 14%). If we continue to the next round, your share will lose even more value. This 65-35 split actually gives you more purchasing power than waiting another round where you'd face even steeper inflation. Let's finalize this now to protect both our interests.
