"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round). I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth less for him in the next round
3. The split is not so unfair that it would likely trigger a long negotiation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer to me: $475,000 * 0.95 (5% inflation) = $451,250 effective value
2. My previous offer to Bob would have given him: $450,000 * 0.9 (10% inflation) = $405,000 effective value

Bob's offer is reasonable considering:
- It's close to a 50-50 split
- The inflation penalty means waiting longer will reduce value for both of us
- Bob made a fair counter-offer rather than an extreme one
- Further negotiation will only decrease the real value for both parties
