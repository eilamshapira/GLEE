5000.0,5000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way we each get $5000. Since there's no time pressure on my end due to inflation, I can be patient in our negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach a mutually beneficial agreement quickly.",Bob,2,
