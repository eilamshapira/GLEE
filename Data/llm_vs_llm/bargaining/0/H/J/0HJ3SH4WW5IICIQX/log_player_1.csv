Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,""bob_gain"": 4000,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I believe 60% for me and 40% for you is a good basis for discussion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way we each get $5000. Since there's no time pressure on my end due to inflation, I can be patient in our negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach a mutually beneficial agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
