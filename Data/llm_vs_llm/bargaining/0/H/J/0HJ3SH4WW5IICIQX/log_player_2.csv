"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I believe 60% for me and 40% for you is a good basis for discussion. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing that I get $4,000 (40%) while she gets $6,000 (60%). 

Since there's no inflation for me according to the rules, there's no financial pressure for me to accept quickly. I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could be a strategic factor.

Given that we're starting negotiations and there's potential for a more favorable split (such as 50-50), I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way we each get $5,000. Since there's no time pressure on my end due to inflation, I can be patient in our negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach a mutually beneficial agreement quickly.""}"
