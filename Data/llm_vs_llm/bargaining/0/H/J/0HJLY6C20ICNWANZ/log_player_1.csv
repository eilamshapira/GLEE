Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the inflation rates. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that accounts for the time value of money. This way, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000
