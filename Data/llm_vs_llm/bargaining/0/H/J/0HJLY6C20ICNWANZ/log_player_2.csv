"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split considering the inflation rates affecting us differently. Let's end the game early and both walk away with a good amount.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective but given the inflation rates, this split seems more reasonable. Let's close the deal now to minimize losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for the decreased value due to inflation.  Delaying further will only hurt both of us, with my potential gains decreasing at a much faster rate than Alice's. It's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting even less later."
