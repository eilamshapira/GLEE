"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable offer that I think Bob will accept, given that we both want to maximize our gains and there's no immediate inflation pressure for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives us each $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
