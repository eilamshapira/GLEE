"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 of the $100, while she keeps $60. 

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, but the total money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round. 

If I were to get a better split in the next round (say 50/50), I'd get $45 equivalent value, which is better than $40 now. However, if Alice rejects my next offer, we'd go to round 3 with another 10% inflation for me, making the money worth even less.

Given the uncertainty of future rounds and the guaranteed inflation penalty, I think accepting $40 now is reasonable.
