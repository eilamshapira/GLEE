This is a tough one! I'm feeling the pressure from the inflation.  Here's my thinking:

* **Time Pressure:** We are running out of rounds. 
* **Unknown Factor:** I still don't know how inflation is affecting Bob. He might be getting desperate too.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting a low offer is bad, but getting zero is worse.

I'll hold out one more round and hope Bob gets nervous."
