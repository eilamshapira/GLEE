Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers. While not ideal, accepting now guarantees me something before inflation eats away more of my potential gains."
