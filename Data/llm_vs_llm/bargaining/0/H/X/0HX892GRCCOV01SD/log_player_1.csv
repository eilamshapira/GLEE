Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, round 3. Let's calculate the inflation impact for me. My money is worth 5% less each round, so in round 3 it's worth 10% less than round 1 (5% * 2). I'll factor that into my offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze. My money is now worth 14.26% less than the original. Bob's money is worth 48.8% less. Bob is offering me $4000. I need to figure out if this is better than what I can expect to get in the next round, considering the inflation.

$4000 with a 14.26% reduction is worth $4000 * (1-0.1426) = $3429.60 in original value.

Rejecting and moving to round 5 means my inflation will be worse. It's likely I won't get much more than this, and might get less. I'll take the sure thing.
