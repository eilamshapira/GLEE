"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1. I'll start with a relatively fair split to encourage acceptance, considering the inflation factor.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. 550k for me, 450k for you. This accounts for potential inflation in later rounds. Let's lock this in!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer was a good starting point. Considering the inflation, I propose a slightly adjusted split: 520k for me and 480k for you.  This ensures a fairer deal as we move into later rounds. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob wants $520,000 and is offering me $480,000. This is round 2, so the value of my potential gains is 10% less than in round 1.

*   **Value of $480,000 now:** $480,000 * 0.9 = $432,000

It's still a decent amount, and going further will only diminish the value of the money even further. I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.
