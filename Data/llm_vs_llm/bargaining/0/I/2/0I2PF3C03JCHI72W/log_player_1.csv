"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split it 60/40. This is a generous offer considering inflation will erode the value of the money for both of us each round. Let's take this sure thing now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option and ensures we both benefit equally from this situation.  Let's not risk further inflation eroding the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
