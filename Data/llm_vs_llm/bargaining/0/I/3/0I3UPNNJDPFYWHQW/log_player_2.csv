"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
- The offer gives me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
- If I get $50 next round, it would actually be worth $45 to me
- Alice's opening offer isn't terrible, but I think I can do better even with inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. Let's not waste time as inflation affects us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal, but let's meet in the middle. This offer still benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Alice is offering me $45, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth about $36.45 to me
- If I reject and propose next round, the inflation will be even higher
- Alice seems willing to negotiate and has improved her offer
- The difference between rounds is getting costly due to inflation
- Further negotiation might result in diminishing returns for both of us

Given that waiting another round will cost me more in inflation, and Alice has made a reasonable compromise from her initial offer, I should accept.
