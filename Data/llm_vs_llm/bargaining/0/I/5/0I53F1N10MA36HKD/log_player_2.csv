"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you receive $999999 and I get $1. If you reject, you'll get to propose in Round 2 and can secure the same $999999 for yourself. Accepting now avoids any further delay â€“ it's an evenly rational outcome in this finite game. 
# Bob gain: 999999 
# Alice gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
