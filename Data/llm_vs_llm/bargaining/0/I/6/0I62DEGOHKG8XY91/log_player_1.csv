Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting your gain, I think it's fair that I get a bit more. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob is acknowledging the impact of inflation on my gains, his offer still heavily favors him. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of my potential earnings due to the decreasing value of the money. I need to hold out for a more balanced deal."
