"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonably fair offer, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering I'm making the first offer, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $45 now, it's worth $42.75 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's offer is reasonable, and continuing the negotiation will only decrease the real value of what I can get
4. Better to secure a decent amount now than risk further depreciation
