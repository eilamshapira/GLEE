"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair share. I believe this division is a good first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation, $100 will be worth $90 in the next round
4. So my maximum potential gain in round 2 would be from a $90 pot

While $40 isn't exactly a 50-50 split, it's not terrible considering:
- The inflation penalty for waiting
- The risk of further negotiations
- The possibility of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
