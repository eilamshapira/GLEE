"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation rate difference between us.

Given that I lose 5% value per round and Bob loses 10% value per round, I should propose a fair split that incentivizes Bob to accept now rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60/40 split because if Bob rejects and we go to another round, the total value decreases more for him than for me. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion now, which is better than waiting and losing 10% of the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation effects and Bob's behavior.

Due to inflation, money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Bob compared to round 1. If we continue to round 4, Bob will face 30% devaluation while I'll face 15%. This creates pressure for Bob to accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is more favorable to Bob than my first offer. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, this is actually a better deal for Bob than waiting another round, and it's more balanced than my initial offer."
