"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me (Bob) and 5% less for Alice with each passing round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the value is now 1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.
For Alice, the value is still $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $1,000,000. For me (Bob), it's now worth 1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $810,000 (19% less than the original).
For Alice, it's now worth 1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $902,500 (9.75% less than the original).

Alice's offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for her. Given the reduced value due to inflation, I'll consider the offer.
