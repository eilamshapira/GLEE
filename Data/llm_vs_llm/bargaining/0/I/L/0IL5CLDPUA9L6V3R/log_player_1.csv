"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly generous split in my favor, considering I need to account for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split that gives me a bit more to compensate for my inflation risk, while still offering Bob a substantial portion."
