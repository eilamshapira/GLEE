"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the inflation rates for both me and Alice.

Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice with each passing round, I should evaluate if the initial split of $65.52 for me and $34.48 for Alice is favorable enough to accept immediately.

Since this is the first round, the full $100 is still available, and no depreciation has occurred yet. The offer gives me approximately 65.52% of the total amount, which is significantly more than half.

Considering the depreciation rates, if I reject this offer, the total amount available for division in the next round would be less for both of us, potentially making future offers less valuable.

Given these considerations, my decision for Round 1 is:
