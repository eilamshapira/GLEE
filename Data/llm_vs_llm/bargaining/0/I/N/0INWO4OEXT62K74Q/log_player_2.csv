Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose I take $650000 and you take $350000. Your portion will decrease significantly due to the 20% reduction in value each round for you, so it's a good idea to accept a fair amount now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
