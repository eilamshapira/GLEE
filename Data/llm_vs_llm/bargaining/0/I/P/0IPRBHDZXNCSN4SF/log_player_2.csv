Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag out hurts us both due to inflation. I'm proposing a compromise - 55/45.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
