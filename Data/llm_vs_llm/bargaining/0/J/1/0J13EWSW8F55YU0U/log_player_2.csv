"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a perfectly equal split between us. This way we both get the maximum value without any inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer:

Alice is proposing an equal 50/50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give each of us $500,000. This is a fair offer that maximizes our joint outcome since we avoid any inflation penalty by settling in the first round.

If I reject, I could propose a different split in the next round, but the total would be reduced by 5% inflation to $950,000. This means even if I got a larger percentage in the next round, I'd need to secure more than 52.6% of the remaining money just to exceed what I'm being offered now.

Given that this is a fair split with no inflation penalty, I'll accept.
