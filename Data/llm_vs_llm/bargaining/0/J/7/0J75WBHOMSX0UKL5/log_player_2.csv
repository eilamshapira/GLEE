"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 62/38 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable starting point considering the inflation disadvantage I face in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration when making my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a more balanced split. It's in your best interest to accept, as the value of the money will decrease significantly for you in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value quickly for both of us.  A 50/50 split is now the fairest option.  I strongly suggest you accept. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value for both of us, a 50/50 split seems reasonable. Given the inflation rates, it's likely that the value will decrease even more in the next round, so I'll accept the offer.
