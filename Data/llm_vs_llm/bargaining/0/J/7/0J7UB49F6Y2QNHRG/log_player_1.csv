"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation penalties.

Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), I should offer a deal that gives him incentive to accept now rather than waiting. However, I also want a fair share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

With this offer, I'm giving Bob a substantial portion while keeping a slight advantage for myself. If Bob rejects, the total amount will be worth less to both of us in the next round, and he'll lose value faster than I will. This seems like a reasonable first offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates."
