"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the effects of inflation.

*   **My offer from Round 1:** $60 (worth full value then)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 2:** $50 (worth 5% less to me)

Let's calculate the relative value:

*   The value of Bob's offer is 95% of what it was in Round 1 for me. So, the actual value I gain is 50 * 0.95 = $47.5

Comparing the two:

*   I was offered $60 in the first round, so $47.5 is less than what I could have gotten in the previous round.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer in Round 2.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the further impact of inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4, considering the accumulated inflation.

*   **My offer from Round 1:** $60 (worth full value then)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 4:** $55 (worth 14.26% less to me)

To compare effectively, let's calculate the relative value of Bob's offer to me.

*   The value of Bob's offer is 85.74% of what it was in Round 1 for me. Therefore, the actual value I gain is 55 * 0.8574 = $47.157

Comparing the two offers:

*   I was offered $60 in the first round.
*   Bob's current offer is worth $47.157 to me.

Since $47.157 < $60, I should reject Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, time to make another offer in Round 5. Inflation is eating away at the value, so I need to adjust my strategy.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 6, accounting for the cumulative inflation.

*   **My offer in Round 1:** $60 (full value)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 6:** $60 (worth 22.62% less to me)

To make a comparison, let's calculate the present value of Bob's offer to me.

*   The value of Bob's offer is 77.38% of what it was in Round 1 for me. Thus, the effective value I gain is 60 * 0.7738 = $46.428.

Comparing the alternatives:

*   My initial offer provided me with $60.
*   Bob's current offer is equivalent to $46.428 for me.

As $46.428 < $60, rejecting the offer seems to be the optimal choice.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7. The value of the money is dwindling, so I'll need to be more aggressive.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 8, considering the cumulative impact of inflation.

*   **My offer in Round 1:** $60 (full value)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 8:** $65 (worth 30.17% less to me)

To determine the effective value of Bob's offer, we compute:

*   The value of Bob's offer is 69.83% of its value in Round 1 for me. Therefore, the actual value I gain is 65 * 0.6983 = $45.38

Comparison:

*   My initial offer was worth $60 to me.
*   Bob's current offer is worth $45.38 to me.

Since $45.38 < $60, I should reject.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 9. The clock is ticking, and the value is going down.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70

*   **My offer in Round 1:** $60 (full value)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 10:** $70 (worth 36.98% less to me)

To find the relative value of Bob's offer to me, we determine:

*   The value of Bob's offer is 63.02% of its value in Round 1 for me. Thus, the actual value I gain is 70 * 0.6302 = $44.114.

Comparing the alternatives:

*   My first offer was worth $60 to me.
*   Bob's current offer is worth $44.114 to me.

As $44.114 < $60, I should reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 11. With only two rounds remaining, I need to be even more assertive.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 12, which is the final round. The inflation effects are severe.

*   **My offer in Round 1:** $60 (full value)
*   **Bob's offer in Round 12:** $75 (worth 43.12% less to me)

Let's determine the effective value:

*   The value of Bob's offer is 56.88% of its original value. Thus, the actual value I gain is 75 * 0.5688 = $42.66

Comparison:

*   The initial offer provided me with $60.
*   Bob's present offer is worth $42.66 to me.

Since $42.66 is less than $60, and this is the final round, I should reject the offer, so that we both get nothing, and I don't get an even smaller amount of money.
