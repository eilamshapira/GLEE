"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice. 
If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
- My $40 would be worth 10% less ($36)
- Her $60 would be worth 5% less ($57)

While the offer isn't exactly equal, it's not terrible. Given that:
1. The money loses value faster for me (10%) than for Alice (5%)
2. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
3. I'll have better negotiating power making a counter-offer in round 2

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still accounting for the fact that the money is now worth less for both of us.

Given that we're in round 2:
- For me, money is worth 90% of original value
- For Alice, money is worth 95% of original value

I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I offer a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than the previous offer, and considering the depreciation rates, it's a fair proposal that gives both of us a good outcome rather than risking further rounds of depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice

With current inflation:
- My $45 is actually worth $36.45 (81% of $45)
- Alice's $55 is worth $49.64 (90.25% of $55)

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- Money will be worth even less (29% less for me, 14.75% less for Alice)
- My $45 would be worth even less
- We're already in round 3 of 12, and the value is decreasing quickly

Given that:
1. The offer is more balanced than the initial 40-60 split
2. Inflation is hitting me harder than Alice
3. Further negotiations will reduce the real value significantly
4. There's still a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I think it's wise to accept this offer now rather than risk further depreciation.
