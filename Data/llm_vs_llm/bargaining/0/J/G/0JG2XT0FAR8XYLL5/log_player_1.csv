"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation that affects both of us, while still being fair enough that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000}

I propose this split because we both face decreasing value over time, though at different rates. Since I face 5% inflation per round and Bob faces 10% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion that would be worth more to him now than a potentially larger amount in future rounds after inflation has reduced its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation we're both facing, while trying to find a more acceptable middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing this split because we're already in round 3, which means the money is now worth less to both of us due to inflation (5% less valuable for me per round, 10% less valuable for Bob per round). Since Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine, it's even more important for him to reach an agreement soon. This offer is more favorable to Bob than my previous one while still recognizing that I face less inflation pressure. I hope Bob will accept this reasonable compromise so we can both benefit before further inflation reduces the value for both of us."
