"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice's offer gives me $460,000 and herself $540,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. 

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me and $950,000 to Alice in the next round. Given these inflation rates, and the fact that we have multiple rounds ahead, I should consider whether I can get a better deal by negotiating.

Since this is just the first round and the offer isn't particularly favorable to me (I get 46% while Alice gets 54%), I believe I can negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 2. Since money is worth 10% less to me each round and 5% less to Alice, I should propose a division that recognizes this asymmetry but is still attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is more equitable than Alice's initial offer, and accepting this now would benefit both of us rather than continuing the negotiation where inflation reduces our total value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is now offering me $475,000, which is better than her initial offer of $460,000. However, due to inflation, the money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1. 

The actual value to me would be: $475,000 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $384,750

If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation for me will increase further. The difference between her current and previous offer shows she's willing to negotiate toward a more balanced split.

Given that we're already in round 3 with significant inflation accumulating, and Alice has improved her offer, this seems reasonable.
