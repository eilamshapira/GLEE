"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for Round 1: You get the entire $10000 and I get nothing. Since each passing round costs me 5% of value while you don’t lose any, I’m offering you the full amount now. I hope you’ll accept so we can avoid further delays. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice has offered me the entire $10,000, with her getting $0. This is extremely generous, but seems unusual. She's correct that she faces a 5% depreciation per round while I face no depreciation.

While this offer maximizes my gain, I should double-check if this is actually what Alice intended, as it seems unlikely someone would offer the entire amount to the other person.

Given the information provided, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
