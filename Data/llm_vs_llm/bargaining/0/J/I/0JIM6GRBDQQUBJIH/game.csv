700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: I take $700000 and you get $300000. Because the value of money falls by 20% for you each subsequent round, locking in $300000 now is a better deal than risking further loss on your side. I believe this is a fair starting offer, and I look forward to your response.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about depreciation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable 55-45 split. Even with your lower 5% depreciation rate, this offer gives you significant value while being fairer to both of us. Let's avoid dragging this out and agree to a reasonable middle ground.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a fair deal. However, given the dynamics of depreciation and the opportunities ahead, I believe I can secure a better effective outcome in the next round. Let’s continue negotiating, and I look forward to your next proposal.",Alice,2,reject
621000.0,379000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Based on the depreciation factors (my money multiplies by 0.95 each round and yours by 0.80) and using backward induction, if you reject, as proposer in round 4 you would secure an effective payoff of roughly $242700. To give you exactly that value this round, I’m offering you $379000 nominal (which, after your 0.64 discount factor in round 3, amounts to about $242560 effective), while I keep $621000 nominal (worth roughly $560570 to me). I believe this is a fair offer that reflects our future bargaining positions. I look forward to your response!",Alice,3,
