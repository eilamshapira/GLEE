"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: I take $700000 and you get $300000. Because the value of money falls by 20% for you each subsequent round, locking in $300000 now is a better deal than risking further loss on your side. I believe this is a fair starting offer, and I look forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $300,000 and Alice $700,000
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * I can make a counter-offer

A 20% depreciation is significant. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in round 2. Even with the depreciation, if I can secure a larger portion of the million, it would be more beneficial.

The current split (30-70) is too favorable for Alice. I should reject and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering our different depreciation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about depreciation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable 55-45 split. Even with your lower 5% depreciation rate, this offer gives you significant value while being fairer to both of us. Let's avoid dragging this out and agree to a reasonable middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Based on the depreciation factors (my money multiplies by 0.95 each round and yours by 0.80) and using backward induction, if you reject, as proposer in round 4 you would secure an effective payoff of roughly $242700. To give you exactly that value this round, Iâ€™m offering you $379000 nominal (which, after your 0.64 discount factor in round 3, amounts to about $242560 effective), while I keep $621000 nominal (worth roughly $560570 to me). I believe this is a fair offer that reflects our future bargaining positions. I look forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 379000 
# Alice gain: 621000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Current offer: $379,000 for me, worth $242,560 after 36% depreciation
2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 48.8% less for me (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8)
   * Next round money will be worth 14.3% less for Alice
   * Alice's calculation of my future bargaining position seems accurate

Alice's logic using backward induction is sound. While the nominal amount still favors her significantly, she's correct about the effective values given our different depreciation rates. If I reject, my bargaining position will weaken even further due to the much higher depreciation rate I face.

The rapid 20% depreciation per round for my side makes it risky to continue negotiating. While this isn't an ideal split, it's likely the best realistic outcome given the asymmetric depreciation rates.
