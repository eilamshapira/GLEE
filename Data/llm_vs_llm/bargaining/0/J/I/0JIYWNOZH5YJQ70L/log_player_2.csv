Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While the effects of inflation are hurting me more, holding out for a fairer offer is the best strategy."

Let's go for a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer and while Alice loses out due to inflation, it's becoming increasingly risky for me to make counter-offers."
