8500.0,1500.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal. I’m suggesting $8500 for me and $1500 for you. Considering that waiting further will cost you more (a 20% loss per round) compared with my 5% loss, accepting now gives you a much better deal than risking a delayed split. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I'm feeling generous. Considering the immediate 20% depreciation on your side and 5% on mine, this offer benefits you more in the long run. Take it or leave it!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
1900.0,8100.0,"Hi Bob, in this round the stakes continue to drop fast with each passing round. Given that if you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but your share will be discounted by an extra 20%, reducing its value considerably—I’m offering you 8100 and keeping 1900. In round 3, your 8100 is worth roughly 8100 × 0.64 = about $5184 in round-1 value, which is slightly more than what you could achieve by waiting for your turn in round 4. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome considering the heavy depreciation, so I hope you accept it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, the situation is deteriorating quickly. I am offering you 4000, this offer is better for you in comparison with my 6000 in round 4. This is the best I can do.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the pressure you're under with the devaluations, but I believe we can both do better if we continue. At 4000 for me and 6000 for you in round 4, I'm not convinced this reflects our respective depreciation rates and future opportunities. I’m countering with the view that if we move to the next round, I’ll be in a stronger position given that your money’s devaluation is more severe. Let’s carry on to round 5 and see if we can craft a division that better accounts for our respective losses over time. I’m rejecting this offer.",Alice,4,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, in round 5 I'm offering to split the $10000 as $3000 for me and $7000 for you. Remember, at this round your money is worth only 40.96% of its nominal value (due to the 20% depreciation compounded over four rounds) while mine is at about 81.45%. If you wait and get to propose in round 6, you'll face an even harsher discount—your money will then be worth only about 32.77% of its face value. In other words, accepting $7000 now gives you an immediate, higher effective payoff than any delay could secure. I believe this division fairly reflects the rapid depreciation affecting your share. I look forward to your response.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, This is a fair deal. 5000 for you, 5000 for me. It's the best we can do. Let's end this.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but given how much more your money has devalued this round (only about 32.77% of its original value) compared to my 77.38%, I’m confident I can craft an offer in Round 7 that gives you an outcome at least as good as your alternative while preserving even more value for me. Therefore, I must reject your 5000/5000 split and move to propose my own division in the next round.",Alice,6,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Bob, as we enter round 7 the pressure from inflation is really biting. Currently, my money is worth about 77.38% of its original value while yours is at roughly 32.77%—meaning that if we wait another round, your next opportunity will see your money devalued further to around 21% of its face value. With that in mind, I’m offering you $6500 on the nominal scale, which in today’s terms gives you an effective value of about 6500 × 0.3277 ≈ $2130. That is a clear improvement over what you can expect if you postpone your offer in round 8. I propose to take the remaining $3500. I believe this division fairly reflects the sharp difference in our depreciation rates and offers you a better outcome than waiting. I look forward to settling this efficiently.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, the situation is critical. Take this offer of 5500 for you, 4500 for me, or we both get nothing. Consider the value of your money.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort in trying to make the situation work, but I believe we can do even better this round. Although your proposal gives me $5500, after accounting for the 30.17% devaluation it effectively comes to roughly $3840, and your $4500 is worth only about $945 in today’s terms. Given that in the next round I'll have the opportunity to propose and structure the deal while the depreciation on my end may not be as steep, I think waiting could allow us both to secure a better real outcome. I must, therefore, reject your current offer and propose my term in round 9.",Alice,8,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Bob, here's my proposal for round 9. Given that at this stage my dollars are worth about 66.34% of their face value (0.95^8) while yours are worth around 16.78% (0.8^8), waiting further hurts you much more. If you reject and get to propose in round 10, even though you might claim almost the whole $10000 nominally, the devaluation at 13.42% (0.8^9) would leave you with roughly $1342 in effective value. By accepting my offer of $8000 nominal for you (which, at 16.78%, equals about $1342 in value) and $2000 nominal for me, you secure that same effective amount now, avoiding the risk of further devaluation. I believe this is the fairest option under our current conditions. I look forward to your acceptance so we can conclude this deal successfully.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, this is a last resort. 6000 for you, 4000 for me. Take it or lose everything.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, given the rapidly worsening depreciation for future rounds, securing 6000 for me and 4000 for you now offers the optimal outcome. My 6000 nominal dollars hold about 63% of their original value (roughly $3781 in today's terms), which is far better than risking even lower effective values in subsequent rounds. I accept your offer so that we both avoid further losses.",Alice,10,accept
