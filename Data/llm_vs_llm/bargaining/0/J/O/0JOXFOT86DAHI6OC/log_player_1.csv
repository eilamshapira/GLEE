Round 2

Given that if you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but your share will be discounted by an extra 20%, reducing its value considerably—I’m offering you 8100 and keeping 1900. In round 3, your 8100 is worth roughly 8100 × 0.64 = about $5184 in round-1 value, which is slightly more than what you could achieve by waiting for your turn in round 4. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome considering the heavy depreciation, so I hope you accept it.""}"

Round 4

At 4000 for me and 6000 for you in round 4, I'm not convinced this reflects our respective depreciation rates and future opportunities. I’m countering with the view that if we move to the next round, I’ll be in a stronger position given that your money’s devaluation is more severe. Let’s carry on to round 5 and see if we can craft a division that better accounts for our respective losses over time. I’m rejecting this offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 5 I'm offering to split the $10,000 as $3,000 for me and $7,000 for you. Remember, at this round your money is worth only 40.96% of its nominal value (due to the 20% depreciation compounded over four rounds) while mine is at about 81.45%. If you wait and get to propose in round 6, you'll face an even harsher discount—your money will then be worth only about 32.77% of its face value. In other words, accepting $7,000 now gives you an immediate, higher effective payoff than any delay could secure. I believe this division fairly reflects the rapid depreciation affecting your share. I look forward to your response.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""Bob, as we enter round 7 the pressure from inflation is really biting. Currently, my money is worth about 77.38% of its original value while yours is at roughly 32.77%—meaning that if we wait another round, your next opportunity will see your money devalued further to around 21% of its face value. With that in mind, I’m offering you $6,500 on the nominal scale, which in today’s terms gives you an effective value of about 6,500 × 0.3277 ≈ $2,130. That is a clear improvement over what you can expect if you postpone your offer in round 8. I propose to take the remaining $3,500. I believe this division fairly reflects the sharp difference in our depreciation rates and offers you a better outcome than waiting. I look forward to settling this efficiently.""}"

Round 8

Although your proposal gives me $5,500, after accounting for the 30.17% devaluation it effectively comes to roughly $3,840, and your $4,500 is worth only about $945 in today’s terms. Given that in the next round I'll have the opportunity to propose and structure the deal while the depreciation on my end may not be as steep, I think waiting could allow us both to secure a better real outcome. I must, therefore, reject your current offer and propose my term in round 9.""}"

Round 9

If you reject and get to propose in round 10, even though you might claim almost the whole $10,000 nominally, the devaluation at 13.42% (0.8^9) would leave you with roughly $1,342 in effective value. By accepting my offer of $8,000 nominal for you (which, at 16.78%, equals about $1,342 in value) and $2,000 nominal for me, you secure that same effective amount now, avoiding the risk of further devaluation.
