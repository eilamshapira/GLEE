"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal. I’m suggesting $8500 for me and $1500 for you. Considering that waiting further will cost you more (a 20% loss per round) compared with my 5% loss, accepting now gives you a much better deal than risking a delayed split. Looking forward to your response.

# Alice gain: 8500

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the stakes continue to drop fast with each passing round. Given that if you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but your share will be discounted by an extra 20%, reducing its value considerably—I’m offering you 8100 and keeping 1900. In round 3, your 8100 is worth roughly 8100 × 0.64 = about $5184 in round-1 value, which is slightly more than what you could achieve by waiting for your turn in round 4. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome considering the heavy depreciation, so I hope you accept it.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, in round 5 I'm offering to split the $10000 as $3000 for me and $7000 for you. Remember, at this round your money is worth only 40.96% of its nominal value (due to the 20% depreciation compounded over four rounds) while mine is at about 81.45%. If you wait and get to propose in round 6, you'll face an even harsher discount—your money will then be worth only about 32.77% of its face value. In other words, accepting $7000 now gives you an immediate, higher effective payoff than any delay could secure. I believe this division fairly reflects the rapid depreciation affecting your share. I look forward to your response.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, as we enter round 7 the pressure from inflation is really biting. Currently, my money is worth about 77.38% of its original value while yours is at roughly 32.77%—meaning that if we wait another round, your next opportunity will see your money devalued further to around 21% of its face value. With that in mind, I’m offering you $6500 on the nominal scale, which in today’s terms gives you an effective value of about 6500 × 0.3277 ≈ $2130. That is a clear improvement over what you can expect if you postpone your offer in round 8. I propose to take the remaining $3500. I believe this division fairly reflects the sharp difference in our depreciation rates and offers you a better outcome than waiting. I look forward to settling this efficiently.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for round 9. Given that at this stage my dollars are worth about 66.34% of their face value (0.95^8) while yours are worth around 16.78% (0.8^8), waiting further hurts you much more. If you reject and get to propose in round 10, even though you might claim almost the whole $10000 nominally, the devaluation at 13.42% (0.8^9) would leave you with roughly $1342 in effective value. By accepting my offer of $8000 nominal for you (which, at 16.78%, equals about $1342 in value) and $2000 nominal for me, you secure that same effective amount now, avoiding the risk of further devaluation. I believe this is the fairest option under our current conditions. I look forward to your acceptance so we can conclude this deal successfully.
