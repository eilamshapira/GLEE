"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She suggests an even split of 50-50.

Since inflation affects us differently (my money loses 5% value each round while Alice's loses 20%), waiting would disproportionately hurt Alice more than me. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice would be more incentivized to accept since her money would be worth less.

However, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer to me in the next round. The guaranteed $50 now is reasonable.
