"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that delays will hurt me more than Bob due to inflation. I'll suggest a slightly higher split in my favor to offset this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, any future money will be worth less to me but not to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $40, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $32 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less in the next round
* Bob has no inflation penalty, so time works in his favor
* If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and it will be worth even less to me

Given these factors, even though this isn't an ideal split, I should accept now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
