"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, we both lose value due to inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you took a larger share initially, I propose a reverse split this round. Accepting now would still be more than your last offer after inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000 worth 80% of original value = $360,000 in round 1 value
* If I reject and propose again, any future agreement will be worth even less (60% of original value)
* My last offer to Bob would have given me $550,000, but that's no longer available
* Getting $360,000 in real value is better than risking further devaluation
