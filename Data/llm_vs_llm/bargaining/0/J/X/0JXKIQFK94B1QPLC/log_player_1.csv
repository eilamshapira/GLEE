"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the value decreasing over time. However, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair, considering the game's dynamics. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
