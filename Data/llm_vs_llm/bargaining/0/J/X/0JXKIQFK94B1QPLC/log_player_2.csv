"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40.  This gives us both a decent share.  Consider that the value decreases over time so it's best to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the value decreasing over time. However, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair, considering the game's dynamics. Let's settle this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better split than your previous offer.  We are both losing value with every round and it seems fair to split closer to the middle.  I am willing to accept a little less than my original offer to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although the inflation has affected the value, it's better to secure this offer now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
