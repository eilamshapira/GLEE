"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an even split. Seems fair to both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, if I reject:
   * Next round the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,500 to me
   * My maximum possible gain would be less than now
4. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it
5. $5,000 now is better than a risky attempt at getting slightly more but with inflation
