"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly 50/50. This way, we both get a fair share, and considering the inflation, it's a reasonable deal for both of us.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your 50/50 split in round 2. Although the nominal amounts are equal, I appreciate your fairness and the need to settle quickly given the inflation affecting my share. Let's agree on the deal.""}"
