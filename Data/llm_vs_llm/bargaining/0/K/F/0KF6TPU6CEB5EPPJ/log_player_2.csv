"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and go to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I reject and propose a better split for myself in round 2, I'd need to offer Alice enough that she would accept, while giving myself more than the inflation-adjusted value of $40 (which would be $40/$0.9 = $44.44 in round 2 dollars).

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and considering that $40 is a substantial portion of the pot, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that gives me a better share while still being fair enough that Alice would likely accept it, considering she needs to factor in the potential inflation if she rejects.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Alice $45 which is a reasonable amount. While it's less than her initial offer to herself, accepting this now would be better for her than risking further inflation if we continue to another round. For me, getting $55 is substantially better than the $40 she initially offered, even accounting for the 10% inflation I'm experiencing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. I've just learned some important information:

1. Alice is not affected by inflation at all
2. I'm now experiencing 19% inflation compared to round 1
3. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55

Let me evaluate this offer:
- Due to 19% inflation, $45 in round 3 is worth $45 Ã— 0.81 = $36.45 in round 1 value to me
- The $40 Alice offered in round 1 would have been worth more to me than this current offer
- If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll experience even more inflation, likely around 27-29%

Since Alice doesn't face any inflation pressure, she can afford to be patient. My bargaining position has significantly weakened now that I know this asymmetry.

Given that the real value of this offer to me is less than her initial offer, and my position will only deteriorate further, I should accept.
