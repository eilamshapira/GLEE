700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm offering you $300000, which is a substantial amount. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. If we go to a second round, the total value to me drops by $50000, which means we both lose potential value.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and considering the inflation, it's a fair deal. If we proceed to the next round, the total value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to agree now.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 60/40 split. This gives you $400000, which is a significant increase from my first offer. Due to inflation, my $600000 is now worth only $540000 to me (after two rounds of 5% inflation). If we go to another round, we'll both lose more value. This is a fair compromise between our positions - you get 40% of the total, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts without further devaluation.",Alice,3,
