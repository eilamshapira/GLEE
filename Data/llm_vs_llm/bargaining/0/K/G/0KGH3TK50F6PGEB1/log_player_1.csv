"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm offering you $300,000, which is a substantial amount. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. If we go to a second round, the total value to me drops by $50,000, which means we both lose potential value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and considering the inflation, it's a fair deal. If we proceed to the next round, the total value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 60/40 split. This gives you $400,000, which is a significant increase from my first offer. Due to inflation, my $600,000 is now worth only $540,000 to me (after two rounds of 5% inflation). If we go to another round, we'll both lose more value. This is a fair compromise between our positions - you get 40% of the total, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts without further devaluation.""}"
