"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm offering you $300000, which is a substantial amount. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. If we go to a second round, the total value to me drops by $50000, which means we both lose potential value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'll make a reasonable offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and considering the inflation, it's a fair deal. If we proceed to the next round, the total value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 60/40 split. This gives you $400000, which is a significant increase from my first offer. Due to inflation, my $600000 is now worth only $540000 to me (after two rounds of 5% inflation). If we go to another round, we'll both lose more value. This is a fair compromise between our positions - you get 40% of the total, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts without further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is already reduced by 9.75%. If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value will decrease further.
