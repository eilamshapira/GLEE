"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth less now, this split gives you $4500 which is still worth $3600 to you - better to accept now than risk further depreciation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $4500 offered to me is indeed worth $3600.

Considering this, I think it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk further depreciation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
