"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

At first glance, getting $4,000 versus $6,000 seems unfair. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 5% less to me (so $10,000 becomes worth $9,500)
2. The money will be worth 20% less to Alice (so it becomes worth $8,000 to her)

This means I could potentially make a more favorable offer next round since Alice will be more pressured by the larger depreciation. However, she might still reject, leading to further depreciation for both of us.

Given that I can make a better offer next round when Alice's position is weaker, and that a 60/40 split isn't particularly favorable to me:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is now worth less to Alice (only $8,000 in value for her), I can leverage this to get a better deal. I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still leaving Alice with enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round where her money would depreciate by another 20%.
