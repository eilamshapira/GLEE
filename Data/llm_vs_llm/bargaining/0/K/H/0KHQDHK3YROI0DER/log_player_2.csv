"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this quick and smooth. I'll take 6000$ and you take 4000$. Fair enough to save us both from inflation? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $4000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * The money will be worth 5% less
   * $10000 * 0.95 = $9500 total value next round
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given that:
- A 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't terribly unfair
- The inflation penalty makes future rounds less attractive
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- The risk of multiple rounds could leave us both worse off
