Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. Given that delaying reduces the overall value for me by 5% every round, accepting now guarantees us both a fair and timely resolution. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle and split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Look forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
