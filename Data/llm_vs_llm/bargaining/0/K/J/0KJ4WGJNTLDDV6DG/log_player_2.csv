Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I get $600000 and you get $400000. Given that delaying reduces the overall value for me by 5% every round, accepting now guarantees us both a fair and timely resolution. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
