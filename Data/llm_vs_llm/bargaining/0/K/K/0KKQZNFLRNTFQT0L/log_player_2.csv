"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair starting offer. Let's secure a good amount now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round.

Current value for me: $450,000
Next round max value: $950,000 Ã— 0.95 = $902,500

While this isn't an equal split, it's a decent offer. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty. The potential upside of negotiating (potentially getting up to $902,500) outweighs the guaranteed $450,000 now.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.
