6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we secure our gains now by splitting $10000 into $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Due to the rapid depreciation on my side with each round, I believe this fair compromise is our best option. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, let's make it a fair split at $5000 each. This way, we both benefit equally, especially considering the changes that affect us with each round. I think it's a win-win scenario for both of us!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your proposal of an equal split. Even though my share now is effectively reduced to 80% of its nominal value, accepting $5000 now gives me an effective value of $4000. Considering that waiting for another round would likely diminish my share even more due to the inflation rate, I'm happy to accept your offer as a fair compromise given our respective discount rates at this stage.",Alice,2,accept
