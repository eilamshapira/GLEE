"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we secure our gains now by splitting $10,000 into $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Due to the rapid depreciation on my side with each round, I believe this fair compromise is our best option. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's make it a fair split at $5000 each. This way, we both benefit equally, especially considering the changes that affect us with each round. I think it's a win-win scenario for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your proposal of an equal split. Even though my share now is effectively reduced to 80% of its nominal value, accepting $5,000 now gives me an effective value of $4,000. Considering that waiting for another round would likely diminish my share even more due to the inflation rate, I'm happy to accept your offer as a fair compromise given our respective discount rates at this stage.""}"
