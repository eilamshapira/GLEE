"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, considering the devaluation I face. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The total amount is $1,000,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less for me, so the total value for me is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. If I accept the offer, I'll get $500,000, which is approximately 55.56% of the total value for me.

Given that Bob's offer is to split it equally, and considering the devaluation he faces (20% less), I think this is a reasonable offer.
