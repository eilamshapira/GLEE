"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer that's appealing enough for Bob to accept, considering the risk of inflation decreasing the value of the money for me in future rounds.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning is that offering Bob $400,000 in the first round is a substantial amount and should be tempting. I keep a larger share for myself to account for the potential inflation I'll face if we go to later rounds. I hope Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money I receive is now worth 10% less. Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $550,000 for me, $450,000 for him.

I need to decide if $550,000 with the 10% inflation hit is better than risking further rounds.

$550,000 * 0.9 = $495,000

Therefore I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
