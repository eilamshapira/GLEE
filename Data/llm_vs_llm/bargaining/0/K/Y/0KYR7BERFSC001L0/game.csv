,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your fair offer. However, since inflation affects you at 5% per round but doesn't affect me, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. With this split, you get $4500 now which is worth more to you than waiting another round, where even $5000 would be worth less due to inflation. This offer maximizes our combined benefit.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I understand your point about inflation, I believe we can still find a more equitable solution. Let's try again next round.",Alice,2,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a split where I get $4750. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it's still better for both of us than continuing to the next round.",Alice,3,
