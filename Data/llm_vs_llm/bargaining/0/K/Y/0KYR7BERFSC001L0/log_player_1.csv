"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fair offer. However, since inflation affects you at 5% per round but doesn't affect me, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. With this split, you get $4500 now which is worth more to you than waiting another round, where even $5000 would be worth less due to inflation. This offer maximizes our combined benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
