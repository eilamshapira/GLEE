"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I should take into account that inflation affects Alice more than me - with each round, the money is worth 5% less to her while it doesn't lose value for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice might be more willing to accept less than 5000 since her money would be worth 5% less. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

That said, a 50-50 split is fair in absolute terms, and Alice might reject an overly greedy counter-offer, leading to further rounds where we both potentially lose.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor but still aims to be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fair offer. However, since inflation affects you at 5% per round but doesn't affect me, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. With this split, you get $4,500 now which is worth more to you than waiting another round, where even $5,000 would be worth less due to inflation. This offer maximizes our combined benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a split where I get $4750. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it's still better for both of us than continuing to the next round. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer. She's proposing I get $5,250 and she gets $4,750, which is a better split for me than her initial 50-50 offer. She's acknowledging the inflation factor that affects her but not me.

If I reject this offer:
- We'll go to round 4 where I can make another proposal
- Alice will face approximately 15% inflation (compared to round 1)
- I could potentially negotiate for slightly more

However, Alice has already moved significantly from her initial position, and this offer is quite reasonable considering the circumstances. If I push too hard, we might end up going through multiple rounds where the total value for Alice continues to decrease, which isn't productive for either of us.

Given that this is already a favorable offer for me and represents a fair compromise, I'll accept.
