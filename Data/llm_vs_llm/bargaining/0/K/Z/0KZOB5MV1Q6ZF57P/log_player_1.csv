"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a proposal to divide $10,000 between Bob and myself, considering that if Bob rejects my offer, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, while its value doesn't decrease for Bob.

Given this asymmetric inflation, I should offer a fair split that Bob is likely to accept immediately, since delaying is disadvantageous for me but not for him.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is fair and gives Bob no incentive to reject and make a counter-offer, which would put me at a disadvantage due to the 20% inflation penalty I face."
