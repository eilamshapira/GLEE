"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my offer for dividing the $10,000.

Considering the 5% inflation per round for me, I should try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives Bob a good share while still securing a fair amount for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob countered with an offer that would give him the majority share. Since we're in round 3 now, the inflation effect is becoming more significant for me. Let me make a more balanced offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
