"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest an equal split, which is fair for both of us. If we delay, we'll both lose value due to the 20% inflation per round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She proposes a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. She makes a valid point about inflation - if I reject, the total value will decrease by 20% to $8000 in the next round
3. This is a perfectly fair offer that maximizes our collective gain
4. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in the next round, and we'd both lose money due to inflation
