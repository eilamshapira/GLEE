"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. 

She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice due to inflation.

This means in the next round, we're effectively dividing $8,000 from my perspective ($10,000 × 0.8) and $9,000 from Alice's perspective ($10,000 × 0.9).

If I reject now, I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,000 in the next round to make it worthwhile, accounting for the 20% loss in value.

Since Alice's offer gives me 40% of the total amount, and inflation will hurt me more than her in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
