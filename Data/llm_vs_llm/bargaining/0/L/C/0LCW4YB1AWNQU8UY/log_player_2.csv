"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, inflation will reduce the value by 5%, meaning the total would effectively be worth 9,500$ to me.

Let me think about whether to accept or counter-offer:
- If I accept now: I get 4000$
- If I reject and try for more: I'd be making an offer on 9,500$ (my value after inflation)

Since we have 12 rounds total and this is only round 1, I think I can try for a better distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer that takes into account the inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, giving us each $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined utility, and it ensures neither of us has to deal with the declining value from further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer with the updated inflation information.

Alice has offered me $4500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total. This is a $500 improvement from her first offer.

What's interesting is that I now know Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine (36% vs. my 9.75% after two rounds). This gives me some leverage in negotiations because time pressure affects Alice more than me.

If I reject this offer:
- Next round, the $10,000 would be worth about 14.75% less to me (assuming another 5% decline)
- For Alice, it would be worth even less (41% less than the first round)

Given Alice's high inflation rate, she's likely to become more willing to compromise in future rounds. However, $4500 is a decent offer already, and we're only in round 3 of 12.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice is facing significantly higher inflation than I am (36% vs. 9.75% after two rounds), I'll make an offer that acknowledges this asymmetry while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering a deal where I receive $5,200 and Alice receives $4,800. This reflects the fact that Alice has more time pressure than I do due to her higher inflation rate. It's fair considering our different positions, and accepting this offer would prevent both of us from experiencing further value depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has now offered me $4800, which is higher than her previous offers of $4000 and $4500. She's gradually increasing her offers.

Our inflation rates are very different:
- My inflation: 18.55% loss from original value
- Alice's inflation: 59.04% loss from original value

Alice is experiencing inflation more than three times faster than I am, putting her under much greater time pressure. At this rate, the money will become worth very little to her in just a few more rounds.

Her current offer of $4800 is decent, and she's clearly moving toward the middle. However, given her extreme inflation pressure, I think I can get an even better deal if I hold out a bit longer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the significant difference in our inflation rates (my 18.55% vs Alice's 59.04% after five rounds), I'll make an offer that acknowledges Alice's much greater time pressure while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself. This proposal considers that Alice has a strong incentive to reach an agreement quickly due to her extremely high inflation rate. If we continue negotiating, the value will decrease much more dramatically for her than for me. This offer represents a fair compromise given our asymmetric positions, and accepting it now prevents further value loss for both of us."
