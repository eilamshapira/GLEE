"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I would get $4500
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be $9000 (90% of $10000)
   * But Alice might reject that
3. $4500 is a reasonable offer (45% of total)
4. Risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation
