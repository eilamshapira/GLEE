"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While Alice is proposing to give me $4000, which is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total $10,000. Since I'm the one who needs to accept or reject, I have some leverage here. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, which could potentially be more favorable to me.

Given that we have 12 rounds total, there's still plenty of time to negotiate. I think I can reasonably push for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split while still leaving room for negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally, which seems fair to both of us. A 50-50 split gives us each $5,000 and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount."
