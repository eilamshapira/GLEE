5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $5500 while you receive $4500. Accepting this offer now ensures we both get full value without the effects of inflation kicking in, especially since my portion declines by 5% every round. I believe this is a fair starting split—looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation will hit us both, I believe a more even split is fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'd prefer to see if we can find a better deal in the next round. The current numbers would give me an effective value of around $3800 after the 5% depreciation, and I believe that as the proposer next round, I can craft a proposal that benefits both of us even more. Let's continue negotiating!",Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 every delay cuts down our future value—my money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. With further rounds, we risk even steeper losses. I’m offering you $4400 and keeping $5600 for myself. This deal secures us both a fair share before the impact of continued inflation worsens our outcomes. Let’s agree now and maximize our effective gains!",Alice,3,
