"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $5500 while you receive $4500. Accepting this offer now ensures we both get full value without the effects of inflation kicking in, especially since my portion declines by 5% every round. I believe this is a fair starting split—looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation will hit us both, I believe a more even split is fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'd prefer to see if we can find a better deal in the next round. The current numbers would give me an effective value of around $3800 after the 5% depreciation, and I believe that as the proposer next round, I can craft a proposal that benefits both of us even more. Let's continue negotiating!""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 every delay cuts down our future value—my money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. With further rounds, we risk even steeper losses. I’m offering you $4400 and keeping $5600 for myself. This deal secures us both a fair share before the impact of continued inflation worsens our outcomes. Let’s agree now and maximize our effective gains!""}"
