"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $5500 while you receive $4500. Accepting this offer now ensures we both get full value without the effects of inflation kicking in, especially since my portion declines by 5% every round. I believe this is a fair starting split—looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 every delay cuts down our future value—my money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. With further rounds, we risk even steeper losses. I’m offering you $4400 and keeping $5600 for myself. This deal secures us both a fair share before the impact of continued inflation worsens our outcomes. Let’s agree now and maximize our effective gains! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600
