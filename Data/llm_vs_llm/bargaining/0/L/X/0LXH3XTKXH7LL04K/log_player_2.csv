"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer:
- I (Bob) would receive $49
- Alice would receive $51

I need to consider if this is a fair offer. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to Alice, while its value doesn't change for me.

Since the split is nearly 50-50 and quite fair, and since there's risk in pushing for more (Alice might reject my counter-offer), this seems reasonable.
