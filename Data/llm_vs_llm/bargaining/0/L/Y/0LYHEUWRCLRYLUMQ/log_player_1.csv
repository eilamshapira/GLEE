"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, keeping in mind the asymmetric inflation rates that affect us differently.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because my money loses value much faster than yours. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that your money loses value faster than mine. To avoid further losses, I'm offering you a generous share in this round. With 450K for me and 550K for you, we can both secure our amounts immediatelyâ€”minimizing the devaluation risk. Let's settle now before the clock ticks further. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
