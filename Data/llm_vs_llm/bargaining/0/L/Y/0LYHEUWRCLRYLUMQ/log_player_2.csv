"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because my money loses value much faster than yours. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

To avoid further losses, I'm offering you a generous share in this round. With 450K for me and 550K for you, we can both secure our amounts immediatelyâ€”minimizing the devaluation risk. Let's settle now before the clock ticks further.""}"
