"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to account for the inflation affecting me while making a reasonable offer to Bob.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer of $50 for me and $50 for him.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Value to me:** The $50 offer is now worth 5% less than it would have been in Round 1. So, it's effectively worth $50 * 0.95 = $47.50 in Round 1 dollars.

*   **Future potential:** If I reject, I get to make an offer in Round 3. But, the money will be worth another 5% less *on top* of the previous 5%. I need to consider whether I can realistically get more than $47.50 (in Round 1 dollars) equivalent in the next round, considering Bob's likely counter-offer.

*   **Risk:** There's always the risk Bob could be even more demanding in the next round.

Given this, accepting $47.50 (in round 1 dollars) seems like a reasonable choice to avoid losing more value to inflation.
