"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round, this is actually a good deal for you - if you reject, your next round's dollars will be worth less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should reject because I can propose a better split for myself in the next round. Since Bob faces 20% inflation each round, they are more pressured to accept offers quickly. I can use this leverage to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Due to the 20% inflation you face each round, this 35$ is worth only 22.4$ if you wait another round. It's in your best interest to accept now rather than delay further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is better for both of us than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since Bob faces significant inflation pressure (their money is worth 48.8% less now), I can push for an even better deal in the next round. Bob's situation becomes worse with each rejection, while mine stays the same, giving me more bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: your $30 now is worth more than $45 in the next round due to your inflation. If we continue negotiating, your purchasing power will keep decreasing. This is your best option right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is impacting me, but I believe we can find a fairer split than this. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With Bob's money now worth 67.23% less, their bargaining position continues to weaken. Their $35 offer is worth even less to them than before, while I maintain my purchasing power. I can push for an even better split in the next round, as Bob's time pressure increases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Your inflation is now over 70%. This $25 now is worth more to you than $35 in the next round. We're running out of rounds, and your position will only get worse. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
