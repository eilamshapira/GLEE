"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this fair and simple. I propose you take $400000 and I take $600000. This way, you're getting a significant amount without the risk of losing value due to the inflation in the following rounds! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I take $400,000 while she takes $600,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I should consider the inflation factor. My money would be worth 10% less, while Alice's would be worth 5% less. 

If I counter-offer in round 2 with a more favorable split for me, Alice might reject it, leading to round 3 where the money would be worth even less for both of us.

The $400,000 now is worth more than a potentially larger amount in future rounds due to my higher inflation rate. While the split isn't 50/50, it's substantial enough given the inflation risk.
