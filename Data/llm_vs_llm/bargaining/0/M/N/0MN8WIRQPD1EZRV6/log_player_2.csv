"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end early 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 (40%) while keeping $6000 (60%)
2. This is not an equal split
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, the money will be worth 10% less next round
5. 10% of $10,000 = $1,000 loss in total value
6. My $4000 now is better than potentially getting $4500 or $5000 of depreciated money later

While the split isn't perfectly equal, the threat of inflation and the decent amount offered makes this a reasonable deal.
