60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a good portion while acknowledging my role as the first mover.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I appreciate your fairness, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable, considering my role as the proposer.  Let's see if you're open to a compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
70.0,30.0,"Given that I'm facing higher inflation (20%) compared to your 10%, I need a larger share to compensate for this disadvantage. This 70-30 split would give me an effective $56 after my inflation, while you'd still get $27 after yours. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"While I acknowledge the impact of inflation on both of us, a 50-50 split seems like the fairest solution, considering we are both now at a disadvantage compared to the initial round.  This way, we both get a fair share after accounting for the reduced value of the money.",Bob,4,
