"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable, considering my role as the proposer.  Let's see if you're open to a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is not attractive enough given the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing. With the 20% reduction, I would only effectively receive $32 (40 * 0.8), while Bob would get $54 (60 * 0.9). I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, 
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Given that I'm facing higher inflation (20%) compared to your 10%, I need a larger share to compensate for this disadvantage. This 70-30 split would give me an effective $56 after my inflation, while you'd still get $27 after yours. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While I acknowledge the impact of inflation on both of us, a 50-50 split seems like the fairest solution, considering we are both now at a disadvantage compared to the initial round.  This way, we both get a fair share after accounting for the reduced value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the current inflation rates, my $50 would be worth effectively $25.60 (50 * 0.512), and Bob's $50 would be worth $36.45 (50 * 0.729). While I'm getting less in real terms, continuing to negotiate would only make both our shares worth even less due to increasing inflation. It's better to secure a deal now than risk further devaluation of the money."
