"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that I'm facing higher inflation (20%) compared to your 10%, I need a larger share to compensate for this disadvantage. This 70-30 split would give me an effective $56 after my inflation, while you'd still get $27 after yours. This is fair considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""While I acknowledge the impact of inflation on both of us, a 50-50 split seems like the fairest solution, considering we are both now at a disadvantage compared to the initial round.  This way, we both get a fair share after accounting for the reduced value of the money.""}
