"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still fair, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I would gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the $4500 offered to me by Bob is actually worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I must weigh the immediate gain against the potential for a better offer in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind the devaluation of the money.

Since Bob's offer does not significantly favor me and considering the devaluation, I think I can negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money is devaluing, in the third round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the second round (which was already 5% less than the first round), so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. For Bob, it's 10% less than in the second round (which was 10% less than the first round), so it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

To make an attractive offer to Bob while also considering my own loss, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the devaluation but still tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Let's calculate the effective value considering the devaluation:
- For me, $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9025
- For Bob, $10,000 * 0.81 = $8100

Considering these values, I'll propose a split that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, hoping he'll accept to avoid further losses.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the devaluation:
- The money I gain is worth 5% less in the first round, then another 5% in the second, and another 5% in the third, and now another 5% in the fourth, which totals to a devaluation of (0.95)^4 = 0.8145 of the original value.
- The money Bob gains is worth 10% less in the first round, then another 10% in the second, and another 10% in the third, and now another 10% in the fourth, which totals to a devaluation of (0.9)^4 = 0.6561 of the original value.

Bob's offer of $4200 to me, considering the devaluation, is effectively $4200 * 0.8145 = $3420.9.

Given this significant devaluation and Bob's offer not being in my favor, I must consider whether accepting this offer is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

However, since the devaluation affects Bob more severely, I might still have room to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the devaluation:
- For me, the money is now worth (0.95)^5 = 0.7738 of the original value.
- For Bob, the money is now worth (0.9)^5 = 0.5905 of the original value.

Given this, I'll aim to make an offer that takes into account the significant devaluation for both of us but still tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since Bob's losses are more substantial, I might be able to negotiate a slightly better split for myself.

However, I also need to be mindful of not pushing too hard, as Bob might decide to hold out for a better offer in subsequent rounds, despite the devaluation.

Let's propose a split that acknowledges the devaluation but tries to be reasonable:
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This split is even, considering the original amount, but given the devaluation, it effectively favors me slightly more due to the differing devaluation rates. However, it's a straightforward and fair offer that might appeal to Bob given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the devaluation:
- The money I gain is worth (0.95)^6 = 0.7358 of the original value.
- The money Bob gains is worth (0.9)^6 = 0.5314 of the original value.

Bob's offer of $4000 to me, considering the devaluation, is effectively $4000 * 0.7358 = $2943.20.

At this point, the devaluation is quite significant, especially for Bob. However, his offer still does not favor me and seems to take advantage of my situation without considering the mutual loss due to inflation.

Given the substantial devaluation and the fact that Bob's offer does not improve my position significantly, I must weigh the risks of further devaluation against the potential for a better offer.

Considering the trend, it seems that Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation without making significant concessions. I might need to consider accepting an offer soon, but this one does not seem favorable enough.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the devaluation:
- For me, the money is now worth (0.95)^7 = 0.6983 of the original value.
- For Bob, the money is now worth (0.9)^7 = 0.4783 of the original value.

Given the significant devaluation, especially for Bob, I'll make an offer that tries to balance my desire for a fair share with the reality of the devaluation. Since Bob's losses are more substantial, I might be able to negotiate a better split for myself, but I also need to consider the overall value of the money decreasing.

Let's propose a split that acknowledges the devaluation and tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement, albeit with a slightly better position for me due to the circumstances:
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, reflecting the differing devaluation rates and the fact that Bob's position has weakened more significantly due to the higher devaluation rate of his share. However, it's still a compromise, considering the original amount and the goal of reaching an agreement before further devaluation occurs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the devaluation:
- The money I gain is worth (0.95)^8 = 0.6634 of the original value.
- The money Bob gains is worth (0.9)^8 = 0.4305 of the original value.

Bob's offer of $3800 to me, considering the devaluation, is effectively $3800 * 0.6634 = $2525.92.

At this point, the devaluation is severely impacting both of us, but especially Bob. His offer, however, does not reflect a willingness to compromise or acknowledge the significant loss in value he is experiencing. Instead, it seems to favor him more than ever, despite his greater loss due to inflation.

Considering the substantial devaluation and the fact that Bob's offer does not improve my position significantly, I must decide whether to accept this unfavorable offer or risk further devaluation.

Given the trend and the significant devaluation, I'm starting to consider that any offer might be better than risking further loss. However, this offer seems particularly one-sided.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the devaluation:
- For me, the money is now worth (0.95)^9 = 0.6302 of the original value.
- For Bob, the money is now worth (0.9)^9 = 0.3874 of the original value.

Given the severe devaluation, especially for Bob, I'll make an offer that tries to balance my desire for a fair share with the reality of the situation. Since Bob's losses are more substantial and continuing to grow, I might be able to negotiate a better split for myself. However, I also need to consider the overall value of the money decreasing rapidly.

Let's propose a split that acknowledges the devaluation and tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement, albeit with a better position for me due to the circumstances:
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

This offer gives me a larger share, reflecting the differing devaluation rates and the fact that Bob's position has weakened significantly. However, it's still a compromise, considering the original amount and the goal of reaching an agreement before further devaluation occurs.

I'm hoping that Bob will see the reason in accepting this offer, given the significant losses he's experiencing and the potential for even greater losses if we continue without an agreement."
