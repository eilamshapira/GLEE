"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will reduce my gains due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage, which is reasonable since I'm making the first offer. If Bob rejects this offer, the next round's value will be worth 10% less to me, so this is a good starting point that should be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
