"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, which is a fair 60-40 split considering that I need to act quickly due to inflation affecting my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer since I know I'm more affected by inflation than Bob (10% vs 5% per round), but this split still gives Bob too much advantage. I'll make a more balanced counteroffer in the next round considering our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a more balanced split, taking into account that I'm more affected by inflation (10% per round) than Bob (5% per round). This 55-45 split is fair and should be attractive to Bob while protecting my interests against the higher inflation rate I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with my higher inflation rate (27.1% loss vs Bob's 14.26%), this 42-58 split is even more unfavorable to me. The real value I would receive is significantly lower than what Bob would get. I'll make a more equitable offer next round that better accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

Given that my money is now worth about 34.4% less than round 1 (while Bob's is only about 18% less), I need to increase my nominal share to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm experiencing. This 58-42 split helps balance out the real value each of us would receive, considering our different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even though it's not ideal, we're already in round 6 and my inflation penalty is getting severe (40.95% loss). If I reject, my next offer would be worth even less to me, and there's no guarantee Bob would accept. With this 4000$ offer, accounting for my 40.95% inflation, I'll get effectively about $2362, which is better than risking further rounds where my money would be worth even less. It's time to secure some value rather than risk getting nothing after round 12."
