"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  It's important to push for a larger share for myself quickly as each round makes the potential gain less valuable.
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my initial offer suggests he might be aiming for a larger portion of the money.  
* **Slight concession:** I reduced my initial ask slightly to incentivize Bob while still aiming for a favorable split for myself."
