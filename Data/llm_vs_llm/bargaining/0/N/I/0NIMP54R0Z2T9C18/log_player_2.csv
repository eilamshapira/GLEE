"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer.

Alice is offering me 450,000$ out of 1,000,000$, which is 45% of the total amount. While it's slightly less than a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount.

Key considerations:
1. This is just the first round, so I have more opportunities to negotiate
2. There's no inflation for me, so the money's value won't decrease
3. We have 11 more rounds, but if we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing
4. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round

Since this is the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate for a better deal without any risk of inflation on my side, I'll reject this offer and try to get a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself while still keeping it reasonably fair for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage (52.5%) while still being close to fair
2. It's not too greedy, which increases chances of acceptance
3. Alice still gets a substantial amount ($475,000)
4. If Alice rejects, we still have 10 rounds to negotiate, but the risk of getting nothing increases"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 477500 
# Alice gain: 522500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $477,500 (47.75% of the total)
2. This is better than her first offer ($450,000)
3. Due to inflation, Alice's portion ($522,500) is actually worth about $471,556 to her (after 9.75% reduction)
4. My portion maintains its full value as I'm not affected by inflation
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but the risk of getting nothing increases
6. Alice's portion is being affected by inflation, which might make her more eager to reach a deal

Since this offer is better than her first one, and considering that inflation is affecting her portion but not mine, this seems like a reasonable deal. The risk of continued negotiation might not be worth the potential gains.
