5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fairly even split with a slight advantage to me since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't. This is fair since if we delay, my share becomes worth less. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm offering an even 50/50 split. This way, we both benefit equally from the full amount right away with no losses due to inflation. Let's make it a win-win and conclude the deal!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5900.0,4100.0,"Bob, I need to reject a 50/50 split because of the inflation I face. With each round, my share loses 10% value while yours doesn't. A fair split needs to account for this disadvantage. At 5900/4100, this compensates somewhat for the 20% inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for even more to offset increasing inflation penalties.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. I'm adjusting my offer slightly in your favor. This proposal acknowledges the value reduction you've faced, aiming for a fairer split considering the circumstances. Let's finalize this now so both of us benefit.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6300.0,3700.0,"Bob, I appreciate the improved offer, but it still doesn't adequately account for the inflation effect. I've now lost 30% of my value through inflation while you've lost nothing. A fair division needs to compensate for this structural disadvantage. This offer of 6300/3700 accounts for the inflation I've faced and will face if we continue. Let's agree now - further delays only force me to ask for even more to maintain fairness.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Alice, I acknowledge the inflation impact you've highlighted. Here's an offer that provides a notable advantage in your favor, compensating for the losses you've been experiencing. This considers both our positions fairly. I hope we can agree on this and bring the negotiation to a successful conclusion.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, I appreciate the improvement, but your offer of 5600/4400 doesn't sufficiently account for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. I've now lost over 40% of my purchasing power, which requires a more significant adjustment. My offer of 6800/3200 more fairly compensates for this structural disadvantage. Let's agree now - the longer we negotiate, the more I need to compensate for inflation, making it harder to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, understanding the inflation impact is crucial, and I'm proposing a split that leans more towards your side, compensating for your loss in value. This is a substantial offer designed to acknowledge your position and conclude the deal fairly. I hope this meets us both in a reasonable middle ground. Let's make this work now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7350.0,2650.0,"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair solution, but 5800/4200 still doesn't adequately compensate for my inflation penalty, which is now over 50%. My purchasing power is severely diminished with each round. This offer of 7350/2650 accounts for this reality and presents our best chance at a fair agreement. We have only 3 rounds left, and further delays will make it increasingly difficult to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I realize that inflation has significantly reduced the value of your share. This offer aims to provide a substantial advantage to you, considering the current situation. With only a few rounds left, I believe this is a fair proposal for both of us. Let's agree and finish this positively.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
7900.0,2100.0,"Bob, we only have one round left after this. My inflation penalty is now over 60%, which means I need a much larger nominal amount to get a fair value. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing. This offer of 7900/2100 reflects the severe inflation penalty I face. Even with this split, due to inflation, my effective value is only about 3060 while you get 2100. Let's agree now rather than both walking away with nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Alice, we've reached the final round and I understand how inflation has drastically affected your share. This offer leans towards your advantage, acknowledging the inflation impact. I believe this still gives us both a reason to agree rather than leave empty-handed. Let's finalize this and both walk away with something valuable.",Bob,12,
