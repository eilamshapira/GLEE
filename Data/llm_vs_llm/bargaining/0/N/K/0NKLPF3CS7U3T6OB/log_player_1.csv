At 5900/4100, this compensates somewhat for the 20% inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for even more to offset increasing inflation penalties.""}"

I've now lost over 40% of my purchasing power, which requires a more significant adjustment. My offer of 6800/3200 more fairly compensates for this structural disadvantage. Let's agree now - the longer we negotiate, the more I need to compensate for inflation, making it harder to reach an agreement that benefits us both.""}"

Even with this split, due to inflation, my effective value is only about 3060 while you get 2100. Let's agree now rather than both walking away with nothing.""}"
