"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fairly even split with a slight advantage to me since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't. This is fair since if we delay, my share becomes worth less. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm offering an even 50/50 split. This way, we both benefit equally from the full amount right away with no losses due to inflation. Let's make it a win-win and conclude the deal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to reject a 50/50 split because of the inflation I face. With each round, my share loses 10% value while yours doesn't. A fair split needs to account for this disadvantage. At 5900/4100, this compensates somewhat for the 20% inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for even more to offset increasing inflation penalties. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900

I'm adjusting my offer slightly in your favor. This proposal acknowledges the value reduction you've faced, aiming for a fairer split considering the circumstances. Let's finalize this now so both of us benefit.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the improved offer, but it still doesn't adequately account for the inflation effect. I've now lost 30% of my value through inflation while you've lost nothing. A fair division needs to compensate for this structural disadvantage. This offer of 6300/3700 accounts for the inflation I've faced and will face if we continue. Let's agree now - further delays only force me to ask for even more to maintain fairness. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300

I hope we can agree on this and bring the negotiation to a successful conclusion.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the improvement, but your offer of 5600/4400 doesn't sufficiently account for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. I've now lost over 40% of my purchasing power, which requires a more significant adjustment. My offer of 6800/3200 more fairly compensates for this structural disadvantage. Let's agree now - the longer we negotiate, the more I need to compensate for inflation, making it harder to reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800

This is a substantial offer designed to acknowledge your position and conclude the deal fairly. I hope this meets us both in a reasonable middle ground. Let's make this work now.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair solution, but 5800/4200 still doesn't adequately compensate for my inflation penalty, which is now over 50%. My purchasing power is severely diminished with each round. This offer of 7350/2650 accounts for this reality and presents our best chance at a fair agreement. We have only 3 rounds left, and further delays will make it increasingly difficult to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.

Let's agree and finish this positively.""}"

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we only have one round left after this. My inflation penalty is now over 60%, which means I need a much larger nominal amount to get a fair value. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing. This offer of 7900/2100 reflects the severe inflation penalty I face. Even with this split, due to inflation, my effective value is only about 3060 while you get 2100. Let's agree now rather than both walking away with nothing.
