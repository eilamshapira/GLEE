"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I need to account for the higher inflation rate that affects my gains (20% per round vs Bob's 5%).

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair while accounting for my higher inflation risk. If Bob rejects this offer, my next possible gain will be worth 20% less, while his will only be worth 5% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

My original offer would have given me $6000, which was rejected.
Bob's counter-offer is $4500 for me, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3600 (4500 * 0.8).

If I reject and make a new offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth even less (another 20% drop for me)
- Bob's inflation is only 5%, giving him a stronger position
- The game could continue with further value erosion

Given that my effective gain of $3600 is still substantial, and continuing would lead to even more value loss for me due to the asymmetric inflation rates, I should accept this offer.
