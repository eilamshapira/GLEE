"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $444,444 and she gets $555,556 of the $1,000,000.

This is close to a 45/55 split. While it's not a 50/50 split, it's reasonably fair. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 20% to $800,000.

If I reject and propose a perfect 50/50 split in the next round ($400,000 each), I would actually get less than the $444,444 Alice is offering me now. Plus, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation.

Given this analysis, I should accept this offer.
