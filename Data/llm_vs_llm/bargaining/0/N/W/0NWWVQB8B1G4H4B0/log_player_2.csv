"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me is now 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.
The value of the money for Alice is now 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

I'll make an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still reasonable for Alice.
