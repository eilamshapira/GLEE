"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I should account for the inflation penalty that affects me (5% less value each round).

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if Alice accepts my offer immediately, the money would be worth 5% less to me.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that this is a fair division, I'll accept.
