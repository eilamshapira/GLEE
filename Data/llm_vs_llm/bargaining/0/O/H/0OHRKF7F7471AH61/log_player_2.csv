"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 20% less to me. So, effectively, it's worth $8,000 to me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, given the ongoing inflation, the money is worth even less to me now. Let's calculate that again:

*   **Initial Value:** $10,000
*   **Inflation over 3 rounds:** 20% per round, so 1 - (1 - 0.2)^3 = 48.8%
*   **Effective Value to Bob:** $10,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $5120

So I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""alice_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, the inflation continues to erode the value for me. Let's calculate:

*   **Initial Value:** $10,000
*   **Inflation over 5 rounds:** 20% per round, so 1 - (1 - 0.2)^5 = 67.232%
*   **Effective Value to Bob:** $10,000 * (1 - 0.67232) = $3276.8

Given how much the value has diminished for me, I have to be more aggressive.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The value of the money is continuing to decrease for me with each round.

Let's recalculate:

*   **Initial Value:** $10,000
*   **Inflation over 7 rounds:** 20% per round, so 1 - (1 - 0.2)^7 = 79.02%
*   **Effective Value to Bob:** $10,000 * (1 - 0.7902) = $2098

I have to try to get as much as possible.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""alice_gain"": 3000
}
```"
