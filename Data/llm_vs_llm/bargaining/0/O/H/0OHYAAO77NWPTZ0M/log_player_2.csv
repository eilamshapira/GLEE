"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $350,000 and keeping $650,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - Next round the money will be worth 5% less for me
   - For Alice, it will be worth 20% less
4. This means in the next round, the maximum value for me would be $950,000
5. The current offer of $350,000 is substantial, but I believe I can get a better deal given Alice's higher inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice faces a much steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), I'm in a stronger negotiating position. However, I should still offer her enough to make it worth accepting rather than moving to another round where she'd face heavy depreciation.

If she rejects my offer, in the next round the money would be worth:
- For her: $800,000 (20% less)
- For me: $950,000 (5% less)

I'll offer a split that gives me a better share than her first offer, but still leaves her with enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round with her steep inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's a better deal for me than her initial offer
2. For Alice, $400,000 now is better than risking another round where her purchasing power would significantly decrease
3. The total still adds up to $1,000,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me
   - With 9.75% inflation, this is worth about $406,125 in round 1 value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4:
   - I'll face 14.25% inflation (another 5%)
   - Alice will face 48% inflation (another 20%)
   - The money will be worth significantly less for both of us

3. This offer ($450,000) is better than Alice's initial offer ($350,000)
   - Even accounting for inflation, I'm getting more value
   - Alice has made a significant concession

4. Given the accelerating inflation penalties and the reasonable improvement in my share, continuing the negotiation might lead to diminishing returns
