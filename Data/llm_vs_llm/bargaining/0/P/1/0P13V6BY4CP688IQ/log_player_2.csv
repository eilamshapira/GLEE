"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
* I'm offered $30 out of $100
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
* $30 now is better than $37.5 in the next round (as I'd need that much to equal $30 due to inflation)
* There's also risk Alice might reject my counter-offer

While $30 is a smaller share, the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive than risking a better deal later.
