"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more balanced split that's still very favorable to you. If you reject, both of us will lose value due to inflation, with me losing more than you (20% vs 5%). This is a win-win proposal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
