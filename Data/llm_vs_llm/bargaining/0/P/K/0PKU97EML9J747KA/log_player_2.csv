"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $200,000 and she gets $800,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. For Alice, the inflation is only 5%
5. $200,000 now is better than $250,000 in the next round (due to inflation)

While the split isn't very equal, the high inflation rate for me (20%) makes waiting costly. If I reject, I'd need to secure a significantly higher amount next round to make up for the inflation loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because despite the inflation penalty, I believe I can propose a more balanced split in the next round that would still be acceptable to Alice, given her lower inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice faces only 5% inflation, so her next round minimum acceptable amount would be around $760,000 (equivalent to $800,000 from this round)
2. I need to offer something that's better for her than waiting another round
3. A more balanced split would be fair, but I need to account for our different inflation rates

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""This is a more balanced split that's still very favorable to you. If you reject, both of us will lose value due to inflation, with me losing more than you (20% vs 5%). This is a win-win proposal.""}"
