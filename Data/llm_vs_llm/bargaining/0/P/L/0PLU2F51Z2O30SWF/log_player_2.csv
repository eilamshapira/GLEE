"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- This is a fair and equal division
- There's no inflation effect for me, but I don't know about Alice
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- We have 12 rounds, but risking multiple rounds could end with both getting nothing
- A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

This seems like a reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in doing so, and this is a fair split.
