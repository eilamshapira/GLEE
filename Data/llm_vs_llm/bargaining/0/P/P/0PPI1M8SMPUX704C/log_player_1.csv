"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start the game by making a fair offer to Bob while considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion of the money, with a slight advantage to me. Since the money loses 5% value for me each round, I have an incentive to reach an agreement quickly. If we move to the next round, the total value would be worth less to me, so this offer aims to find a fair balance that Bob would accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
