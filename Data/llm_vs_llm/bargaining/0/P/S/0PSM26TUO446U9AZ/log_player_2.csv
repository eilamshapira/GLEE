Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation impact on your share, I propose that I take $6500 and you take $3500. This accounts for your reduced value and still provides a fair division. Let's settle here. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500
