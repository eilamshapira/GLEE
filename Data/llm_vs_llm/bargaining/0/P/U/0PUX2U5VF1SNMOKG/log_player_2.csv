"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Alice has offered me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself. While this isn't an even 50-50 split, it's a relatively fair offer, especially for a first round. I have a few considerations:

1. This is a decent amount of money that's not too far from an even split
2. We have 12 rounds, but there's risk in rejecting as we could end up with nothing
3. By accepting now, we both get a substantial amount and avoid the risk of a breakdown in negotiations

While I could reject and counter with a more favorable split, this offer is within a reasonable range and securing $450,000 is better than risking getting nothing through prolonged negotiations.
