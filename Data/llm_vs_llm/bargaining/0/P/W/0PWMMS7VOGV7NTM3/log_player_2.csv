"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $49 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $49 now > $47.50 (95% of $50) next round, even if I could get $50

This is a fairly reasonable offer. While slightly in Alice's favor, the cost of inflation makes rejecting risky. I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
