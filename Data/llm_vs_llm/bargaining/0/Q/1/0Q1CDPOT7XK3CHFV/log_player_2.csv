"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%) in future rounds, this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject this offer:
   * The $100 will be worth 20% less for me next round ($80 effective value)
   * I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
   * If Alice rejects, the value decreases again

2. Current offer:
   * I get $40 immediately
   * Alice gets $60
   * No risk of further devaluation

3. Analysis:
   * The 60-40 split isn't exactly equal
   * But if I reject, I need to get significantly more than $40 next round to make up for the 20% devaluation
   * If Alice rejects my counter-offer, I'll be in an even worse position

Given the asymmetric devaluation rates and the risk of further rounds, this offer is actually reasonable. While not perfect, it's better than risking further devaluation.
