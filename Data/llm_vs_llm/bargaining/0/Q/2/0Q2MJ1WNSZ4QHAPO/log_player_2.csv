"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split favoring me slightly to account for the inflation I'm facing. This is a reasonable offer, and we can avoid losing money as time goes on. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round's $100 will be worth 20% less to me ($80 real value)
3. Alice's opening offer is fairly reasonable, giving me 45% of the pot
4. Rejecting means I need to make a better deal while working with less effective money
5. There's risk in rejection as we don't know Alice's inflation rate

Given the significant inflation penalty and the relatively fair initial offer, accepting seems wise. The potential gain from negotiating isn't worth the guaranteed 20% loss in value.
