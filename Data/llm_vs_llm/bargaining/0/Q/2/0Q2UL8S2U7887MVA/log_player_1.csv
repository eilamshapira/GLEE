"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair and reasonable starting point, offering Bob a slightly smaller share. It leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, but also signals my willingness to split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I am proposing an even split this time. After Bob's rejection of my previous offer, I am willing to compromise and offer a 50/50 split. This demonstrates fairness and signals a willingness to work together to reach an agreement before the value of the money further diminishes."
