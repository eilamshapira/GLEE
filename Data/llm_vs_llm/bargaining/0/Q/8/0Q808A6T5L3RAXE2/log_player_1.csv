"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that waiting will hurt Bob more than me due to the higher inflation rate on his side. It's better for him to accept a slightly smaller amount now than to wait and lose more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Due to inflation, if I accept this offer:
- I would get $45, but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $42.75
- Bob would get $55, but it's worth 20% less, so effectively $44

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The inflation will be even worse (10% for me, 40% for Bob from original value)
- I could propose a new split, but Bob might reject again

Since Bob's money devalues faster than mine, and this offer still gives me a reasonable amount even after inflation, I'll accept.
