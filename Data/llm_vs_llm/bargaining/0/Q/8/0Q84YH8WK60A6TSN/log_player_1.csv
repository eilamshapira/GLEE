"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering we both want to maximize our gains and there's inflation for Bob's money value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a fair division that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that if we move to another round, his money will be worth less due to the 5% inflation penalty he faces."
