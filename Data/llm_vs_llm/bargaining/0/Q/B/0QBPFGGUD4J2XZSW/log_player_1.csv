"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. My money is worth less now. Let's calculate:

*   **My Gain (now):** $4500
*   **Effective Value for me (20% less than Round 1):** The value of the $4500 is now only worth $4500 * (1 - 0.20) = $4500 * 0.80 = $3600

Considering the inflation effect and the fact that I have fewer rounds remaining, I will make a decision to accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
