""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round while you don't. This means my money loses value if we delay, putting me at a disadvantage. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and allows us to finish the game efficiently.""}"
