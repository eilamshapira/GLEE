"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round while you don't. This means my money loses value if we delay, putting me at a disadvantage. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and allows us to finish the game efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice.

Alice is offering me $450,000 of the $1,000,000, which is 45%. She's arguing that she deserves more because she faces a 5% inflation penalty each round while I don't lose any value.

This is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject and we go to the next round, her money would indeed be worth 5% less to her. Since I don't face inflation, I could propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, but Alice might reject that.

Given that I'm already being offered a substantial amount ($450,000), and there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a much better offer from me in the next round (since any delay hurts her more than me), I'll accept this offer.
