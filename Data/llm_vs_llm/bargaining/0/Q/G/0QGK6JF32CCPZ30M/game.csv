60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation affecting me. You get a solid $40, and I get $60 to offset potential losses from inflation if we delay.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation affects you more, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself to ensure I don't lose value over time. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to 40% inflation for me in this round, I need a higher nominal amount to get fair value. My $65 is actually worth only $39 to me now due to inflation. This offer is quite reasonable considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on your value, I'm willing to offer you a substantial amount, but I also need to protect my own interests since my value remains unaffected by inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, with 59% inflation affecting me this round, my $75 is only worth about $30.75 to me in real value. Your $25 maintains its full value. This is actually a very balanced offer in real terms. Let's reach an agreement before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to make a more favorable offer to you, but I still need to prioritize my own unchanged value. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late.",Bob,6,
