"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation affecting me. You get a solid $40, and I get $60 to offset potential losses from inflation if we delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects you more, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself to ensure I don't lose value over time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me reason about this: Bob's offer gives me $45, but due to 20% inflation in round 2, that's actually worth $36 to me. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation. However, I need to be careful about prolonging the negotiation too much due to the compounding inflation effect."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to 40% inflation for me in this round, I need a higher nominal amount to get fair value. My $65 is actually worth only $39 to me now due to inflation. This offer is quite reasonable considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your value, I'm willing to offer you a substantial amount, but I also need to protect my own interests since my value remains unaffected by inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me reason about this: Bob's offer of $40 to me, after 48.8% inflation, would only be worth about $20.48 to me in real value. This is far too low. Even with increasing inflation, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. However, I need to be mindful that with each round, my bargaining position weakens due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, with 59% inflation affecting me this round, my $75 is only worth about $30.75 to me in real value. Your $25 maintains its full value. This is actually a very balanced offer in real terms. Let's reach an agreement before inflation erodes more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to make a more favorable offer to you, but I still need to prioritize my own unchanged value. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let me explain my reasoning: With 67.23% inflation in this round, my $35 would be worth about $11.47 in real value. If I reject and continue to the next round, inflation will be even higher (about 73.78%), meaning I would need an even larger nominal amount to get the same real value. Given that we have a limited number of rounds and Bob's position gets stronger with each round due to inflation only affecting me, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less real value in later rounds."
