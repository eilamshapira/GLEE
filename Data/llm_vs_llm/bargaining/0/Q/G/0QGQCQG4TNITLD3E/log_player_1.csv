"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  Since we're both losing value with each round, we need to move towards a faster resolution. This offer is still fair, considering your potential loss is double mine. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation difference makes this offer less attractive. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%) and helps us both avoid further value loss. It's a fair compromise - let's conclude this now.""}"
