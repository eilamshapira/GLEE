Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%) and helps us both avoid further value loss. It's a fair compromise - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
