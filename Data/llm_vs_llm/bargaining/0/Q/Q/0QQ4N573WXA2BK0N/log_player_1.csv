Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of an even 50-50 split. This is a fair outcome for both of us, and there's no reason to risk further negotiations when we can both walk away with a significant amount right now."
