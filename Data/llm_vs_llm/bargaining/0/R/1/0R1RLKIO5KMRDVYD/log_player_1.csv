"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. Even though my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I think this is the fairest solution. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose money, so let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
