"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share, but we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer doesn't seem entirely fair to me. Alice is proposing to take 60% of the money while giving me 40%. I need to consider the inflation rates - my money depreciates faster (10% per round) than Alice's (5% per round).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $4000 would be worth only $3600 to me after 10% inflation. I should propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, acknowledging our different inflation rates while still aiming for fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. Even though my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I think this is the fairest solution. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose money, so let's make a deal now.""}"
