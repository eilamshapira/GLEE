"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of an equal split of $5,000 each.

Given that I face 5% inflation per round, waiting means my share becomes less valuable. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for more, the value would be affected by inflation.

With an equal split now, I get a guaranteed $5,000 with no inflation penalty. This is fair and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing after 12 rounds.
