"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while still securing a good deal for myself. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to the 20% inflation on his side."
