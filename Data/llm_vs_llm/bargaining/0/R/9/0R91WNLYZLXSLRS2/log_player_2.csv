"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. I need to consider if this is fair given the inflation rates.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where my money would be worth 20% less, but Alice's only 10% less. This asymmetric inflation puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

While I could counter-offer in the next round, the declining value means I should be strategic about prolonged negotiations.

Given the significant inflation penalty for me and the reasonable portion being offered, I'll accept this offer.
