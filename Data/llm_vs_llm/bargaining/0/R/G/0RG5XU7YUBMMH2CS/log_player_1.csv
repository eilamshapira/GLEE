Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation affecting us, I propose we split it evenly at 50-50 this round. It's getting urgent to settle, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's getting too risky to keep rejecting.  While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
