512820.0,487180.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a prompt agreement: I get $512820 and you get $487180. Given that each round delays the deal and reduces the value by 5%, this split reflects our respective positions—with a slight edge for the proposer. I believe it’s a fair division that saves us both from unnecessary discount losses. Let’s agree now and secure our shares!",Alice,1,

490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose I get $510000 and you get $490000. This is a fair division that acknowledges the time value of money and ensures we both benefit. Let's secure our shares now before the value depreciates further. Don't let greed cost us both!",Bob,2,
