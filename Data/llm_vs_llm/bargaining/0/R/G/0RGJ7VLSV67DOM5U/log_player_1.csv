"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 512820, ""bob_gain"": 487180, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a prompt agreement: I get $512,820 and you get $487,180. Given that each round delays the deal and reduces the value by 5%, this split reflects our respective positions—with a slight edge for the proposer. I believe it’s a fair division that saves us both from unnecessary discount losses. Let’s agree now and secure our shares!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose I get $510000 and you get $490000. This is a fair division that acknowledges the time value of money and ensures we both benefit. Let's secure our shares now before the value depreciates further. Don't let greed cost us both! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
