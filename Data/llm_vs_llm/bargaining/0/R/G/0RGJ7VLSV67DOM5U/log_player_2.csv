Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a prompt agreement: I get $512820 and you get $487180. Given that each round delays the deal and reduces the value by 5%, this split reflects our respective positions—with a slight edge for the proposer. I believe it’s a fair division that saves us both from unnecessary discount losses. Let’s agree now and secure our shares! 
# Bob gain: 487180 
# Alice gain: 512820
