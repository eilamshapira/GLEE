Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, it's my turn. Let's account for the lost value. My inflation is now at 40% (20% + 20%), and Bob's is at 10% (5% + 5%). I need to secure more to account for that.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""Bob, my inflation is hitting hard. I need $65 to compensate. You still get $35, which is more than fair considering your inflation is lower. Let's end this now!""

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This round's offer takes into account the reduced value of money for me more than ever. Let's agree and end this now!

# Bob gain: 60
