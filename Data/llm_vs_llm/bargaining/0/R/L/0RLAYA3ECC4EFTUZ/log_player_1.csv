"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement soon due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair, Alice. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. We both get a good amount, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45 with 5% inflation, so effectively $42.75
2. If I reject, my next offer will be subject to 10% inflation for me
3. Bob has proposed a relatively reasonable split
4. Waiting longer risks further value loss and potential deadlock

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer as I believe I can still negotiate a better deal despite the inflation penalty.
