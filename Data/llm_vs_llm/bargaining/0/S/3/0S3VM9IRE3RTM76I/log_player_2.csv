"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. 

Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, if I reject this offer, the total money will still be worth $1,000,000 next round, but it will only be worth $800,000 to me. If I make a counter-offer next round, I'd need to get at least $500,000 to match what I'm being offered now ($400,000).

This offer gives me 40% of the total, which isn't terrible given the inflation pressure. I need to decide if it's worth the risk to reject and counter-offer.
