Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's make this a win-win! I'll take $60 and you get $40. Fair deal to start with?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), waiting longer hurts you more. I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
