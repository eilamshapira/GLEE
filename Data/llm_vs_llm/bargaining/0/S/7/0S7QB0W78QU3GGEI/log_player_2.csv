"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this a win-win! I'll take $60 and you get $40. Fair deal to start with? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Given the inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Alice), if I reject this and we continue to later rounds, the total value decreases more rapidly for Alice than for me.

Since this is just the first round and I have the advantage in terms of inflation rate, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer now. Given the inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Alice), time pressure affects Alice more than me. I should leverage this but still be fair enough that she's likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since the money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), waiting longer hurts you more. I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's go for an equal split this round. $50 each seems fair and reasonable, considering the inflation. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now proposing an equal split of $50 each.

Current inflation status:
- My inflation: 9.75% less value than round 1
- Alice's inflation: 36% less value than round 1

If I reject, we move to round 4 where my inflation would be around 14.75% and Alice's would be around 49%. The gap continues to widen in my favor with each round.

However, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and while I could potentially get more in later rounds due to the inflation difference, there's also risk in continuing. Alice might be less willing to compromise further.

Given that we're already in round 3 and this is a reasonable offer, I'll accept.
