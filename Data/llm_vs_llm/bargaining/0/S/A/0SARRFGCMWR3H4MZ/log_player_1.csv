"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer to Bob, considering the time pressure and inflation factors.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable and gives us both substantial value. Since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now maximizes your outcome. If we go back and forth, we both risk getting nothing.""
