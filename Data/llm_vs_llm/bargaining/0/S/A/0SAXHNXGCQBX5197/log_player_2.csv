"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. But I need to consider the inflation factor that affects only me.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I proposed the same 5000/5000 split in round 2, my 5000 would only be worth 4000 to me due to inflation.

Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty per round while Alice faces none, this first-round 50-50 split is actually the best I can do in terms of real value to me. If I reject, any future negotiations would result in me getting less effective value.
