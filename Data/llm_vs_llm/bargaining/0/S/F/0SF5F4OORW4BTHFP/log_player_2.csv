"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start considering the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, as inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% each round, which means I should value offers in earlier rounds more highly.

Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an even split, getting 400,000$ now is better than risking further rounds with inflation.

Let me think about the next round: if I reject this and make a counter-offer, the total value to me would only be 800,000$ due to 20% inflation. Even if I were to get 60% of that in the next round, it would be 480,000$ which is only slightly better than taking 400,000$ now.

Given the uncertainty of whether Alice would accept my counter-offer and the guaranteed loss from inflation, I'll accept this offer.
