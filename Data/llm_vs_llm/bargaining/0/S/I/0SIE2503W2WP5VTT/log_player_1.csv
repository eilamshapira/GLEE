Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's secure our gains now. My offer reflects a fair split, but delaying further will cost me 5% per round due to inflation. Accept this 55/45 split so we both come away with a substantial amount without further erosion of value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
