"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my potential gains will be worth 5% less
   * $40 now > $38 (95% of $40) in the next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation and potentially worse outcomes. $40 is a reasonable offer - it's not too far from a 50-50 split.
