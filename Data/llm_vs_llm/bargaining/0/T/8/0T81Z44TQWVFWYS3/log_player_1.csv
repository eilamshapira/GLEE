"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly, as inflation will hurt my share in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation hurts your share more than mine. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $450,000, it's actually worth $360,000 to me (450000 * 0.8).

If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less (only 64% of original value). This means I'd need to secure a much larger nominal amount to make up for the inflation.

Bob's offer, while not ideal, gives me a significant portion while avoiding further inflation penalties. If I reject, I risk getting even less in real terms due to the mounting inflation effect.
