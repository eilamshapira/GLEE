5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I'm proposing a split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is actually the best for both of us since the money loses more value for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round. If we delay, we both lose. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good deal.",Alice,1,
