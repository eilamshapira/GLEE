"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is actually the best for both of us since the money loses more value for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round. If we delay, we both lose. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good deal.""}"
