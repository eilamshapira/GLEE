"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I'm proposing a split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is actually the best for both of us since the money loses more value for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round. If we delay, we both lose. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4500 while she gets $5500.

She makes a valid point about inflation - my money loses value faster (10% per round) than hers (5% per round). If I reject and we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for me.

If I reject, I could counter-offer in the next round, but the total pot would effectively be worth less to me due to inflation. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth, especially to me.

Given these inflation rates, accepting now is likely better than extending negotiations where my position weakens further with each round.
