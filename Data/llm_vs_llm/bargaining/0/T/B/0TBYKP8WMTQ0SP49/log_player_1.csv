Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the 20% inflation, my offer is 525k for me and 475k for you. It's a fair split considering the reduced value. Let's end this now before it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
