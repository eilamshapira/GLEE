5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you while still accounting for my 5% inflation rate. This is a fair compromise - my inflation is hurting me more with each round, and you're facing an even steeper 20% inflation. Let's reach an agreement now to minimize our mutual losses.",Alice,3,
