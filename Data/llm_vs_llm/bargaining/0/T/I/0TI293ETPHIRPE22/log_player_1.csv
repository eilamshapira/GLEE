Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation each round. If we both reject offers, we both lose money due to inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a split that is fair after factoring in my inflation. Accepting this offer is better than risking further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you while still accounting for my 5% inflation rate. This is a fair compromise - my inflation is hurting me more with each round, and you're facing an even steeper 20% inflation. Let's reach an agreement now to minimize our mutual losses.""
