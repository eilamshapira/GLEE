"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation each round. If we both reject offers, we both lose money due to inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to face inflation, I have no way of verifying that. Even if she does, her offer is significantly skewed in her favor. It's worth risking one round of inflation to see if I can negotiate a better deal.  My goal is to secure at least a 50/50 split after accounting for my inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a split that is fair after factoring in my inflation. Accepting this offer is better than risking further losses for both of us.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** My initial offer aims for a near-even split after my 20% inflation is factored in (5200 / 1.2 = ~4333). This means I'm essentially seeking a 50/50 split of the original value.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** By highlighting the potential losses for both of us due to inflation, I am urging Alice to consider a more balanced deal. My offer presents a compromise that, while favoring me slightly, is significantly fairer than her initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you while still accounting for my 5% inflation rate. This is a fair compromise - my inflation is hurting me more with each round, and you're facing an even steeper 20% inflation. Let's reach an agreement now to minimize our mutual losses. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now acceptable for a few key reasons:

* **Inflation Impact:** While Alice claims a 5% inflation rate, which is unverifiable, the confirmed inflation rates significantly impact us both. My potential gains are dwindling rapidly, making each additional round increasingly risky.
* **Offer Value:** Accepting 4800 in this round, after a 36% inflation hit, equates to roughly 3077 of the original value. This is still below a 50/50 split of the original amount, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to reject offers in the hope of a slightly better deal is too risky at this point.  Alice might not offer a better deal, and the losses from inflation would continue to escalate.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer now secures a reasonable amount, even if not ideal, and avoids further potential losses."
