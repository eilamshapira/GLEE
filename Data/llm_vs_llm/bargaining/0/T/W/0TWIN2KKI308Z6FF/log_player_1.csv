Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Remember that due to inflation, delaying further rounds reduces the value for both of us, so this equal division makes sense now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
