"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the full $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

If I counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split, but I need to consider that Alice might reject it as well, leading to further devaluation through inflation.

Given that I'd be losing $500 in value by moving to the next round, and that my counter-offer would need to give Alice enough to accept, I'll reject this initial offer as I believe I can achieve a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Remember that due to inflation, delaying further rounds reduces the value for both of us, so this equal division makes sense now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Considering inflation, I'm still giving you a good portion. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4,300 while she gets $5,700.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1. This means that the $4,300 Alice is offering is equivalent to about $3,881 in round 1 value ($4,300 Ã— 0.9025).

If I reject and go to round 4, the inflation penalty will increase further, and the entire $10,000 will be worth even less to me. Additionally, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept my next offer.

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation penalty is significant, and Alice has improved her offer from round 1 (from $4,000 to $4,300). Given the diminishing value of future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
