"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the inflation penalty I face in future rounds.

Alice has offered me $400,000 (40%) while taking $600,000 (60%). If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value to me decreases by 20%.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to me due to inflation. This means even if I propose and Alice accepts a deal where I get 50% in round 2, I'd only receive $400,000 in effective value - the same as Alice's current offer.

Since there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in round 2, and further delays would only reduce the money's value to me, I should accept this initial offer.
