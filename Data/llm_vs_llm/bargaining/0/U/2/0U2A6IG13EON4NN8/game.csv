714285.0,285715.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division now: I'll take $714285 and you'll get $285715. This reflects a fair split based on our respective discount factors. Accepting now avoids any further loss in value for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,1,

809524.0,190476.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I’ll take $809524 and you get $190476. Given the inflation penalties—my money now is worth 80% of its Round 1 value and yours 60%—if you reject this offer, you’d be the proposer in Round 4. But then, to secure my acceptance, you’d have to offer me nearly $714286 (so I'd get an effective 0.7×714286 ≈ $500000), leaving you only about $285714 nominal, whose effective value is 0.4×285714 ≈ $114286. Since that’s worse for you than the effective payoff of 0.6×190476 ≈ $114286 here, it makes sense for you to accept now. I believe this division is the fair reflection of our discount rates and avoids further losses. What do you think?",Alice,3,
