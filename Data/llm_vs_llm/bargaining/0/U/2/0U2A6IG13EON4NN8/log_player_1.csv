Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 714285, ""bob_gain"": 285715, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division now: I'll take $714,285 and you'll get $285,715.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split of $1000000. This way, we both maximize our gains before inflation hits us harder. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 809524, ""bob_gain"": 190476, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I’ll take $809,524 and you get $190,476. Given the inflation penalties—my money now is worth 80% of its Round 1 value and yours 60%—if you reject this offer, you’d be the proposer in Round 4. But then, to secure my acceptance, you’d have to offer me nearly $714,286 (so I'd get an effective 0.7×714,286 ≈ $500,000), leaving you only about $285,714 nominal, whose effective value is 0.4×285,714 ≈ $114,286. Since that’s worse for you than the effective payoff of 0.6×190,476 ≈ $114,286 here, it makes sense for you to accept now. I believe this division is the fair reflection of our discount rates and avoids further losses. What do you think?""}"
