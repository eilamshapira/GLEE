Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division now: I'll take $714285 and you'll get $285715. This reflects a fair split based on our respective discount factors. Accepting now avoids any further loss in value for both of us. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 714285

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,""alice_gain"": 500000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split of $1,000,000. This way, we both maximize our gains before inflation hits us harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I’ll take $809524 and you get $190476. Given the inflation penalties—my money now is worth 80% of its Round 1 value and yours 60%—if you reject this offer, you’d be the proposer in Round 4. But then, to secure my acceptance, you’d have to offer me nearly $714286 (so I'd get an effective 0.7×714286 ≈ $500000), leaving you only about $285714 nominal, whose effective value is 0.4×285714 ≈ $114286. Since that’s worse for you than the effective payoff of 0.6×190476 ≈ $114286 here, it makes sense for you to accept now. I believe this division is the fair reflection of our discount rates and avoids further losses. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 190476 
# Alice gain: 809524
