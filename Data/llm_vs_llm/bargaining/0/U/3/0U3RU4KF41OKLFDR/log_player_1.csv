"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 37.77, ""bob_gain"": 62.23, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the 10% per round loss in value we both face if the negotiations drag on, I propose we split the $100 right now as $37.77 for me and $62.23 for you. Waiting would only shrink the pie further, and this offer reflects the outcome we’d expect if both of us continued rationally on future rounds. I hope you’ll see the merit in securing a good deal immediately and accept this proposal.""}"
