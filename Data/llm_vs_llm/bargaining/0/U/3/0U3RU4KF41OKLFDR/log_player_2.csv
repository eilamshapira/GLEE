"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the 10% per round loss in value we both face if the negotiations drag on, I propose we split the $100 right now as $37.77 for me and $62.23 for you. Waiting would only shrink the pie further, and this offer reflects the outcome we’d expect if both of us continued rationally on future rounds. I hope you’ll see the merit in securing a good deal immediately and accept this proposal. 
# Bob gain: 62.23 
# Alice gain: 37.77 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
