"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer of 4500 is worth 10% less to me, so it's effectively 4500 * 0.9 = 4050.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:
For me: 10000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 8100
For Bob: 10000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 9025

I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 4300, ""bob_gain"": 5700}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money I gain is worth 27.1% less, so the offer of 4000 is effectively:
4000 * (1 - 0.271) = 4000 * 0.729 = 2916

This is a relatively low offer, considering the inflation. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:
For me: 10000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 7290
For Bob: 10000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 8573.75

I'll make an offer that's slightly more generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept.
