"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if Alice accepts in round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable amount offered, I'll accept this offer.
