"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100. Since I'm Alice and I'm affected by the 5% inflation per round, I need to be strategic.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we divide the money with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. This is a fair offer considering that if we go to additional rounds, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, while it remains the same for you. I believe this split acknowledges both our positions in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3 and the money I receive is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer to account for this.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. This is a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I'm facing. Since each round reduces the value of my share by 5%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a better deal than my initial proposal while still compensating me for the inflation risk I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","As we're now in round 5, the money I receive is worth about 19% less than in the first round due to compounding inflation. I need to adjust my offer accordingly while trying to reach a compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose that I receive $52 and you receive $48. This is a more balanced offer that accounts for the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing. I've moved significantly from my initial position, reducing my request by $8 since the first round. Since each round reduces the value of my share by 5%, continuing this negotiation much longer will significantly hurt me while not affecting you. This offer represents a fair compromise given our different positions regarding inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 39 
# Bob gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 7, and the inflation effect on my share is becoming quite significant - approximately 27% less value than in the first round. I need to be pragmatic while still trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a perfectly equal split of $50 each. Despite the inflation disadvantage I face, I'm willing to move to this balanced position in the interest of reaching an agreement. This is a significant concession from my initial position, and represents a fair and principled solution. With each round, the money becomes less valuable to me while remaining the same for you, so I hope we can conclude our negotiation with this equitable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
