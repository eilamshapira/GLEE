This is my first offer. I'm taking a large share, but leaving Bob with something.  It's a fair starting point considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still taking a majority. Bob rejected my initial offer, so I'm demonstrating flexibility. However, I still need to secure a substantial share to make this worthwhile considering the inflation."
