"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $100,000 for me and $900,000 for Alice
2. This is only round 1, and I have more opportunities
3. If I reject, money will be worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice next round
4. The split is very unfavorable (10%-90%)
5. Given Alice's money depreciates faster than mine, she has more incentive to reach a deal sooner

I'll reject this offer since it's too low, and I can make a counter-offer next round. The depreciation affects Alice more than me, so I have some leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I'll make a more balanced offer but still give her a decent portion to encourage acceptance. Since we're in round 2, the money has already depreciated once.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's much more equitable than the previous 90-10 split
2. I still give Alice a slight advantage to make it attractive
3. If she rejects, her portion will depreciate more quickly than mine
4. It's a reasonable offer that shows willingness to compromise while maintaining my interests"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $100K to $200K, but it's still a very unbalanced split (20-80)
2. The money has depreciated:
   - For me: -9.75% (so $200K is worth about $180.5K in round 1 terms)
   - For Alice: -19% (so her $800K is worth about $648K in round 1 terms)
3. We still have 9 rounds left
4. Alice's money is depreciating almost twice as fast as mine
5. Her slight improvement in offer shows she's willing to negotiate, but not enough yet

Given that Alice's money is depreciating faster and the offer is still quite unfavorable, I'll reject and make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000}

My reasoning:
1. We're in round 4, so:
   - My money has depreciated by about 15% from round 1
   - Alice's money has depreciated by about 28% from round 1
2. My previous 450K-550K offer was rejected, so I'm making a small adjustment
3. The split is still favorable to Alice (52.5%-47.5%) which should make it attractive
4. Given the faster depreciation rate for Alice, accepting this offer would be better for her than waiting
5. If she rejects, her portion will continue to depreciate more quickly than mine

This is a fair offer that accounts for the depreciation rates and should encourage agreement before the money loses too much value for both of us."
