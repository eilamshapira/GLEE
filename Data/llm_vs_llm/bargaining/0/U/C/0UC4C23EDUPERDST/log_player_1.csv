"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that each round reduces the value by 5% for me and 20% for Bob, I should propose a fair but strategic split. Since Bob's money devalues much faster than mine, he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a substantial $400,000. This is a reasonable first offer because:
1. It's a significant amount for Bob that will be worth much less if he waits
2. The 60-40 split is not too greedy and shows willingness to share fairly
3. If Bob declines, his counter-offer will be worth less to both of us, especially to him"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $400,000 at 95% value = $380,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 80% value = $480,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * Values will decrease further (90% for me, 60% for Bob)
   * Bob will be under more pressure due to his higher inflation rate
   * However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given that:
- Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount
- The effective values are relatively close ($380K vs $480K)
- Further delays will reduce both our values significantly
- There's risk in continuing negotiation
