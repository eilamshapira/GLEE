"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of the $100, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair division that gives us equal shares. Since inflation doesn't affect my value (0% inflation for me), there's no particular advantage for me in waiting to make a counter-offer in the next round.
