"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money 60/40. Since inflation will affect future rounds for me, it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to adjust my offer considering the inflation pressure on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a more balanced split that gives you a reasonable amount while accounting for the fact that I'm facing 20% inflation with each round."
