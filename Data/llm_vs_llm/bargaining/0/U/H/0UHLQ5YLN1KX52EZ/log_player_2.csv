"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Given that:
1. I don't know Alice's inflation rate
2. We have limited rounds 
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. I can make a counter-offer if I reject

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, especially since it's still early in the game.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to make it attractive for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it. It's not too greedy, considering we need to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and the money's value isn't decreasing for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45
2. She's experiencing significant inflation (36% less value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation
4. We've used 3 rounds out of 12
5. Her $55 is now worth significantly less to her due to inflation

Given that Alice is experiencing heavy inflation and has improved her offer to me, while I'm not affected by inflation at all, this seems like a reasonable deal. If I reject, she might become more aggressive in her demands in future rounds to compensate for her inflation losses.
