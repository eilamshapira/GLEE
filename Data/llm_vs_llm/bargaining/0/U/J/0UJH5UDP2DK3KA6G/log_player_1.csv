Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm making the first move and taking initiative in our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split. Let's go 55-45 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 
At 5% inflation, my $45 would be worth $42.75 in terms of round 1 value.
Bob's previous rejection of my 60-40 split suggests he won't accept a very uneven split in my favor if I reject.
If we continue to the next round, any gains would be worth even less due to further inflation.
$42.75 is less than my initial proposal but still a significant portion, and continuing might lead to worse outcomes.
