Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 70

Even with inflation, accepting 30 dollars is a bad outcome for me. I need to try and push for a better deal, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a risky move, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. However, I'm hoping Alice might be feeling the pressure of the inflation as well and will accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk getting an even worse one later."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the money is plummeting, and it's highly unlikely I'll secure a better deal at this point. Accepting a 25/75 split is far from ideal, but waiting will likely result in an even smaller share."
