"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer in the first round.

Given that we have inflation concerns, I should account for that. Bob's money loses 20% value each round, while mine doesn't lose value. That gives me some negotiating leverage since waiting is more costly for Bob than for me.

I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage to me:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

This gives Bob a reasonable share while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation asymmetry."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that takes into consideration our negotiation so far.

Bob rejected my 60/40 split and countered with 50/50, but his position weakens with each round due to inflation. The money is now worth 20% less to him compared to round 1, while my value remains unchanged.

I'll propose a slightly better offer for Bob than my first one, but still advantageous to me given the inflation dynamics:

{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42}

This gives Bob a bit more than my original offer while recognizing that I have a stronger position due to the inflation asymmetry."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
