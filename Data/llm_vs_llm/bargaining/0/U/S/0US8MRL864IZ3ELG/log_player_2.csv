"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round and mine doesn't lose any value:

* If we go to next round:
  * Alice's $5000 would only be worth $4000 to her
  * I could offer her a lower amount and she might accept
  * The threat of further devaluation gives me leverage

I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, taking advantage of the depreciation of Alice's share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and she knows that going to the next round will devalue her share further, I can offer her less than 5000 while still making it attractive for her to accept.

Her $5000 from round 1 would now only be worth $4000 to her. I can offer her $4500, which is better than what she'd get if she rejects and we go another round (where her share would devalue further).

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor, which is fair considering the depreciation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $6000, which is better than my previous proposal
2. She's taking $4000, which for her is now worth only $2560 (due to 36% depreciation)
3. If I reject:
   * We go to next round
   * Her money will depreciate further (by 48%)
   * But I risk her making an even worse offer later

This is actually a good offer for me - I get 60% of the total, which is more than I proposed last round. While I could potentially get more by rejecting, the risk isn't worth it as this is already a favorable split.
