"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is an equal split of $5,000 for each of us. Let me think about this strategically.

Since the money loses 10% of its value for Alice each round but maintains its value for me (0% decrease), I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

If we move to round 2, Alice will value the total amount at $9,000 (10% less), while I still value it at $10,000. This gives me leverage to ask for more than 50%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the 10% inflation that Alice experiences.

Since Alice now values the total pot at $9,000, I can offer her the same subjective value that she offered me in the previous round while taking more for myself.

If Alice gets $5,500, that's worth $4,950 to her now (due to 10% depreciation). This is approximately the same subjective value she offered me in round 1, while I get $4,500.

However, I could also be slightly more aggressive since I have the inflation advantage. I'll propose a division that gives me a bit more while still being reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500, which is worth about the same to you as $5,000 would have been in the previous round due to your 10% inflation. This is a fair adjustment that accounts for the changing value of money for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered me $5,800 and she would take $4,200. This is actually quite favorable to me compared to the initial 50-50 split she offered in round 1.

Since the money doesn't lose value for me but has already lost 19% of its value for Alice, she's making a rational concession. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where the money will be worth even less to her (approximately 27% less than the original value).

This offer gives me 58% of the total money, which is a good outcome for me. While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's also a risk that we continue going back and forth, which primarily hurts Alice but doesn't guarantee me a better outcome.
