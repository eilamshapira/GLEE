"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you get $6000 and I get $4000 out of the $10000. Given that waiting will reduce my share's value by 20% each round, I believe itâ€™s in both our interests to agree now. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $6,000 while she takes $4,000, which is a 60-40 split in my favor.

I need to account for the 10% inflation per round that affects my portion. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me.

Alice's offer gives me $6,000 now. If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $6,666 in the next round to break even (since $6,666 after 10% inflation would be worth about $6,000).

This is actually a pretty favorable offer for me, giving me 60% of the pot. Since waiting would decrease the value through inflation, and there's uncertainty about future negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
