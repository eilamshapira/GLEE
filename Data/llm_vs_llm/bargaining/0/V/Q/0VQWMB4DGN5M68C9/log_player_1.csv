"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation risk if we move to the next round.

This is a fair 50-50 split. I believe offering an equal division is the most reasonable approach for the first round, as it demonstrates good faith and fairness. For me, accepting a lower amount in later rounds would be less desirable due to the 20% inflation penalty I'd face."
