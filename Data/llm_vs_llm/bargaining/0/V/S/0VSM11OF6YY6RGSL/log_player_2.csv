"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice is offering me $100,000 while keeping $900,000 for herself.

If I reject:
- The money will be worth 10% less to me next round
- But only 5% less to Alice
- I can make a counter-offer
- We still have 11 rounds left

$100,000 now is better than $90,000 next round, but this initial offer is quite unfair. Given that we have many rounds left and I can make the next offer, I'll reject this highly uneven split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice has more to lose from delays due to her lower inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split which is much more equitable than the previous 90-10 split, while still giving me a slight advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Alice's new offer is $150,000 for me and $850,000 for her.

Due to inflation:
- My $150,000 is actually worth $121,500 (81% of original value)
- Next round it will be worth even less (29% total reduction)
- There are still 9 rounds left

While Alice has increased her offer from $100,000 to $150,000, it's still a very uneven split (85-15). Given that:
1. We still have many rounds left
2. The inflation difference between us is only 5% per round
3. This is still a very unfair split

I will reject and make a more reasonable counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 4 and inflation is becoming a real concern, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Alice while still maintaining fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a completely equal 50-50 split. This is a very fair offer that should be hard to reject on principle. Since Alice seems to be driving a hard bargain, this equal split demonstrates good faith and should help reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much value for both of us."
