"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a careful backward‐induction analysis of the alternating‐offer game with discounting only for you (Alice) and no discounting for Bob, the unique subgame perfect equilibrium outcome is that Bob ends up receiving the entire $100, and you receive nothing. (This result is driven by the fact that every round of delay costs you 20% of the value, giving Bob all the bargaining power. For any offer that gives you a positive amount, Bob can always profit by waiting one round and proposing his own division that leaves you less, so he will only agree to a proposal that gives him $100 immediately.) 

Thus, in Round 1 as Alice the equilibrium proposal is to offer Bob the full $100:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100}

Note that this is the theoretical subgame perfect equilibrium in this setting."
