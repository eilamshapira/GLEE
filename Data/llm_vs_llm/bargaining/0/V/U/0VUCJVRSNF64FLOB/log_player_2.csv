"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me (meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me). For Alice, it would decrease by 5% (making it worth $950,000 to her).

Given this asymmetric inflation penalty, and considering that I'd get a substantial amount ($400,000) with this offer, I'll accept rather than risk further devaluation.
