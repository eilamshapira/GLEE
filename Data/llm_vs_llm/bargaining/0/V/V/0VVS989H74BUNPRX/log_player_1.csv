"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face, while still being fair to Bob.

""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,000 because if we delay, the money will be worth much less for you due to your 20% inflation rate. This is a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while avoiding value loss for both of us.""
