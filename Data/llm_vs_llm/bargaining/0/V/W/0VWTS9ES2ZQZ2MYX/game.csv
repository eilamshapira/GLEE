60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's start with a more balanced split. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? This gives me a slight edge, accounting for my inflation, while still giving you a substantial amount. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, since we're both feeling the pinch of inflation, how about we adjust to 55-45 in my favor this round? This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's find a middle ground.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, let's try to find a deal here. How about 52 for me and 48 for you? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to consider the rapidly decreasing value for me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, given the significant inflation rates we're facing, I propose we split it 52-48 in my favor this round. This should balance out the value loss for both of us. Let's reach an agreement soon.",Alice,5,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, it's getting tight. Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with it. We're both losing value rapidly.",Bob,6,
