"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount. I'll propose a 50/50 split of the original $10,000, but taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me.
