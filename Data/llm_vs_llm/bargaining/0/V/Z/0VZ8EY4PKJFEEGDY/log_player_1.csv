"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair initial offer that acknowledges both players need to agree quickly due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover but still offers Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $40 with 5% inflation, so effectively $38
- If I reject, next round I can make a new offer but will face another 5% inflation
- Bob's inflation is higher at 20%, but he's still trying to get a larger share
- We have 10 more rounds left

Given that my inflation rate is lower than Bob's, and we still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's inflation rate is higher (20%) than mine (5%), and he rejected my first fairly generous offer, I'll adjust my offer slightly but keep it reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm offering a slightly higher split in my favor compared to my first offer, considering that Bob's money is devaluing faster and we both need to reach an agreement before too many rounds pass."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $35 with 14.26% inflation, so effectively about $30
- Bob's money is worth 48.8% less, so his $65 is worth much less to him
- The inflation rates are accelerating significantly
- We have 8 more rounds left, but the value is deteriorating quickly
- Bob's inflation rate is much higher than mine, which gives me some negotiating power

Given that my inflation rate is still much lower than Bob's, and his offer gives me an even smaller share than before, I'll reject this offer. The gap between our inflation rates suggests I should be getting a larger share, not smaller.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's inflation rate (48.8%) is significantly higher than mine (14.26%), and we're already in round 5, I need to make an offer that acknowledges this reality while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept before the money loses too much value.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor because:
1. My money devalues much slower than Bob's
2. We need to reach an agreement soon before further inflation
3. Given the inflation rates, this split actually gives Bob more real value than his last offer would have given me"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $30 with 22.62% inflation, so effectively about $23.21
- Bob's $70 is worth 67.23% less, so effectively about $22.94 to him
- The inflation is severely impacting both of us, but much more so for Bob
- We have 6 rounds left, but the value is deteriorating rapidly
- Bob's offer gives me less than before, despite his money being worth much less

Even though the money is rapidly losing value, Bob's offer is getting worse for me while his own inflation rate is much higher. This doesn't make strategic sense. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since my inflation rate is much lower.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the severe inflation rates (mine at 22.62%, Bob's at 67.23%) and that we're now in round 7, I need to make a compelling offer that reflects these economic realities.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm proposing this 65-35 split because:
1. Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine (67.23% vs 22.62%)
2. With only 5 rounds left after this, we need to reach agreement soon
3. Due to the difference in inflation rates, this split actually gives us similar effective values
4. Bob's previous offers have been unreasonable given the inflation dynamics
5. This offer gives Bob a chance to secure some value before his share becomes worth even less"
