"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 5% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose taking $5,500 for myself and giving $4,500 to Bob. This is a fair split that's slightly in my favor but not too greedy, which increases the chances Bob will accept. If he declines, my next opportunity will be worth less due to inflation, so I want to make this initial offer attractive enough for acceptance."
