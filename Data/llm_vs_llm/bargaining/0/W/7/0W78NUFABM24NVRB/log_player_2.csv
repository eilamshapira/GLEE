"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject Alice's 50-50 split offer:
- The money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
- I can make a counter-offer, but Alice could reject it
- Future rounds mean more value lost to inflation for me

The current offer gives me $500,000. If I reject and the game goes another round, even if I manage to get a bigger share, I'll lose 10% of whatever amount I end up with.

A fair 50-50 split right now seems better than risking value loss through inflation in subsequent rounds. The offer is reasonable and I'd rather secure $500,000 now than gamble on getting more later with guaranteed depreciation.
