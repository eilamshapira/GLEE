"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first offer: I'll take $55 and you get $45. Let's settle now to avoid any inflation loss on my end. I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: I get $45, Alice gets $55
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * I'll get to make the next offer
   * $100 will only be worth $90 to me in the next round

The offer gives me a decent portion (45%), but I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer. However, the 10% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more than $45 in the next round just to break even ($45/0.9 = $50).

Given the inflation risk and that $45 is a reasonable offer, I'll accept.
