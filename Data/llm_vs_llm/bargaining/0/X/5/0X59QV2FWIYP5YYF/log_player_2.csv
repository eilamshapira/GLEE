"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is the fairest division that respects both of our interests equally. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm fine with resolving this now with a 50-50 split. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, she mentions that inflation doesn't affect her, which means delaying might hurt me more than her.

With 10% inflation per round, if I reject this offer, the $10,000 will be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. If we eventually split it 50-50 in a later round, I'd get less than $5,000.

Since this is a fair initial offer and inflation works against me, I'll accept.
