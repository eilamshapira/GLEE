"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will make an offer that I believe Bob will find reasonable, considering the potential for the money to lose value over time due to inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation impact. Bob's offer is less appealing now, and my potential gains are diminishing. Let's calculate my actual gain.
If I accept, I'd receive $40. This is worth 5% less than the first round, so it's equivalent to $40 / 1.05 = $38.10 from round 1.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Remembering that the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in round 1, and I don't know Bob's inflation impact, I'll try to make an offer that's more appealing to him while still giving me a decent share.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is really starting to bite for both of us! Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $35.
*   **My inflation:** My money is worth 14.26% less than round 1. So $35 is worth $35 / (1 - 0.1426) = $40.82 in round 1 money.

This is not great, but the rounds are running out and the money is losing value fast. I will accept
