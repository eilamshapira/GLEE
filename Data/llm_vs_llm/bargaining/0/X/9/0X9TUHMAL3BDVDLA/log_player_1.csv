"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 357143, ""bob_gain"": 642857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing we settle immediately with a division that factors our future discounts. If we delay, my share drops by 20% each round and yours by 10%. In equilibrium terms, you’d be entitled to 64.3% of the pie when it’s your turn to propose; therefore, to avoid further loss, I propose you get $642,857 and I get $357,143. I believe this is fair given our time preferences—let’s close the deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was too generous. I'm proposing we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering our different discount rates. Accept now and we both get a share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 357143, ""bob_gain"": 642857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're in round 3. Remember, if you reject my proposal, you'll be the proposer in round 4, but due to your 10% discount rate, your best outcome remains effectively $642,857 in nominal terms. To avoid further losses from continued delay (and my 20% discount factor), I'm offering you exactly that amount now, leaving me with $357,143. Let's settle now before the pie shrinks any further for both of us.""}"
