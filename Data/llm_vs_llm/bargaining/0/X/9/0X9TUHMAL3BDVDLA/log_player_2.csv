"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing we settle immediately with a division that factors our future discounts. If we delay, my share drops by 20% each round and yours by 10%. In equilibrium terms, you’d be entitled to 64.3% of the pie when it’s your turn to propose; therefore, to avoid further loss, I propose you get $642857 and I get $357143. I believe this is fair given our time preferences—let’s close the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was too generous. I'm proposing we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering our different discount rates. Accept now and we both get a share of the money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're in round 3. Remember, if you reject my proposal, you'll be the proposer in round 4, but due to your 10% discount rate, your best outcome remains effectively $642857 in nominal terms. To avoid further losses from continued delay (and my 20% discount factor), I'm offering you exactly that amount now, leaving me with $357143. Let's settle now before the pie shrinks any further for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143
