"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83.33, ""bob_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67. Given that waiting means a 5% drop for me and a 20% drop for you in the next round, accepting today maximizes our payoffs. Looking forward to a quick agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the drop in value, I'm proposing a fairer split. I get 60, you get 40. Take it or leave it, the value will drop significantly if we keep waiting. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but given our respective discounting—my value only dropping 5% per round while yours drops 20%—I expect that by waiting until round 3 when I can propose the split, I can secure a better effective outcome for myself. Therefore, I'll have to reject your 40/60 offer.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83, ""bob_gain"": 17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are even higher due to further discounting. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but your cake will be worth only 80% of $100, and given our differing discount rates, your best continuation value is roughly $16.67 in today's terms. To make accepting worthwhile for you, I’m offering $17, leaving me with $83. I believe this offer gives you a slight improvement over waiting. Let’s settle now before further value is lost!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the situation is getting desperate. This is my final offer: I get 55, you get 45. Take it. We can't afford to wait any longer! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your offer of $45 for me might seem appealing at first glance, the discounting dynamics work strongly in my favor if we continue. In round 4 I’d effectively receive about 45 × 0.8574 ≈ $38.58 in round-1 value. If I reject and get to propose in round 5, my money will be discounted by only about 18.55% (since 0.95⁴ ≈ 0.8145), and I can leverage the fact that your funds would be discounted even more (roughly 59.04% discount, since 0.8⁴ ≈ 0.4096). Under the standard alternating-offers logic, as the proposer I can secure roughly 83% of the remaining pie’s value, translating into an effective payoff well above what your offer gives me. For these reasons, I must reject your 45/55 offer. I look forward to proposing a division that reflects the advantage my position offers in the next round.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83.33, ""bob_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 5 the discounting is becoming severe. Accepting now gives you a nominal $16.67, which—at your current discount factor of 0.4096—translates to about $6.83 in round-1 value. If you reject and become the proposer in round 6, you'll face an even steeper discount (only 0.3277 of the nominal value), leaving you with a similar effective payoff. In light of this, I'm offering you $16.67 and keeping $83.33 for myself. I believe this offer reflects our respective alternatives accurately. Let's agree now to avoid further losses!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the last chance. We split it evenly, 50/50. If you reject, we both get nothing. Choose wisely. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, since this is the final round and rejecting means we both end up with nothing, I will accept your offer. Even though my money is worth 22.62% less than in round 1, a 50-dollar share still has a higher effective value than nothing. Let's conclude the game on these terms.""}"
