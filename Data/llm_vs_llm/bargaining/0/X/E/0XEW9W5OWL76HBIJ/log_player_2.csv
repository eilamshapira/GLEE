"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67. Given that waiting means a 5% drop for me and a 20% drop for you in the next round, accepting today maximizes our payoffs. Looking forward to a quick agreement!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are even higher due to further discounting. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but your cake will be worth only 80% of $100, and given our differing discount rates, your best continuation value is roughly $16.67 in today's terms. To make accepting worthwhile for you, I’m offering $17, leaving me with $83. I believe this offer gives you a slight improvement over waiting. Let’s settle now before further value is lost! 
# Bob gain: 17 
# Alice gain: 83

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the discounting is becoming severe. Accepting now gives you a nominal $16.67, which—at your current discount factor of 0.4096—translates to about $6.83 in round-1 value. If you reject and become the proposer in round 6, you'll face an even steeper discount (only 0.3277 of the nominal value), leaving you with a similar effective payoff. In light of this, I'm offering you $16.67 and keeping $83.33 for myself. I believe this offer reflects our respective alternatives accurately. Let's agree now to avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 16.67
