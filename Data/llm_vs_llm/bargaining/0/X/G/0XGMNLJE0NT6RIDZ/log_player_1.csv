"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the standard first-mover advantage in negotiation games.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer.  Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob offers me $45 while keeping $55
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $55 is actually worth $49.50 to him (10% less)
3. My $45 is worth the full $45 to me (no inflation effect)
4. If I reject, we go to another round, but I'm not sure how much more inflation will affect Bob

Since the split is relatively fair and I don't know how inflation might affect future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
