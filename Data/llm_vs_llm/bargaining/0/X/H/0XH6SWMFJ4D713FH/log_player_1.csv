"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 450000 * 0.8 = 360000
Bob gain: 550000 * 0.8 = 440000

I think I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""My turn, 52/48 seems reasonable, don't wait too long""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is rising, 58/42 is a better compromise now 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values would be:
Original value * (0.8)^3 = 0.512
Alice gain: 420000 * 0.512 = 215040
Bob gain: 580000 * 0.512 = 297280

I'm not satisfied with this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth (0.8)^4 = 0.4096 of its original value.
