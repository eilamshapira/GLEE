"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer, but is still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than risking inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable offer that acknowledges my first-mover position while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $450,000 is actually worth $405,000 (90% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth only 80% in the next round
3. If Bob rejects my next offer, we'll keep losing value with each round
4. $405,000 is still a significant amount, and the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation is considerable

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation effect makes it better to secure this amount now rather than risk further devaluation in future rounds."
