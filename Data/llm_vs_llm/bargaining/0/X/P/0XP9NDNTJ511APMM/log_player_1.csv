"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make a proposal to Bob to divide $1,000,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us each round. I want to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, especially considering it's Round 1.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the reduced value of the money. For me, $500,000 in this round is worth 80% of what it was in round 1. For Bob, $500,000 is worth 90% of what it was in round 1.

Calculating the values:

*   My value: $500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 (in round 1 dollars)
*   Bob's value: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 (in round 1 dollars)

Given these values, Bob is getting a better deal than I am. It's early in the game still, and I think I can get a better offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, round 3. The inflation is starting to bite. This round, my money is worth 64% of the initial value, and Bob's is worth 81%.

To make the offer more appealing to Bob, while still accounting for the inflation and my need to secure a decent amount, I'll adjust my proposal slightly. I also want to make sure it's higher than the equivalent value of his last offer to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Round 4. The inflation is getting worse.

*   My money is worth 52% of the initial value.
*   Bob's money is worth 72.9% of the initial value.

Let's calculate the current values of Bob's offer, in round 1 dollars:

*   My value: $520,000 * 0.52 = $270,400
*   Bob's value: $480,000 * 0.729 = $349,920

Bob is still getting more than I am in initial value terms, even with the offer. Since the game is moving towards the middle, I'm going to push for a better offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 5. Inflation is really hitting hard now. I need to be more careful.

My money is now worth 40.96% and Bob's is worth 65.61% of what it was in round 1.

I'll try to make an offer that's tempting for Bob, while still netting me a decent amount.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Round 6. The pressure is on.

* My money is worth 32.77% of the initial value.
* Bob's money is worth 59.05% of the initial value.

Calculating the values of Bob's offer, in round 1 dollars:

* My value: $510,000 * 0.3277 = $167,127
* Bob's value: $490,000 * 0.5905 = $289,345

Bob is still getting significantly more than I am, in terms of the initial value of the money. I'm running out of rounds, but I need a better deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Round 7. We're more than halfway through. I really need to consider accepting a deal soon, but I'll make one more attempt to get a slightly better offer.

My money is worth 26.21% of the initial value, and Bob's is worth 53.14% of the initial value.

I'll try to offer something that gives a little more to Bob, but still gives me a reason to accept:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
