"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I face in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45. This is slightly in my favor because if we go to additional rounds, my money will be worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... With the 5% inflation, if I accept this offer of $50, it would actually be worth $47.50 to me (50 * 0.95), while Bob gets the full $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, any money I get will be worth even less due to additional 5% inflation. This is not ideal, but further delays could make my position worse.
