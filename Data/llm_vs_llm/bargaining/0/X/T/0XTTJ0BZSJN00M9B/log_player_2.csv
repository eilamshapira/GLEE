"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only 1% of the total amount. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, keeping in mind that time pressure affects me more than Alice due to the 5% inflation penalty per round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slightly favorable split for myself to compensate for the time pressure I'm under. This is a fair offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while recognizing that I need to secure a good deal quickly due to the 5% inflation penalty affecting only my gains."
