Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on our shares, I propose a split of 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This offer takes into account the decreasing value of money over rounds and aims for a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
