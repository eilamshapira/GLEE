Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's try to find a fairer offer given the inflation affecting me. Remember, the money I receive now is worth 10% less than in Round 1, and *another* 10% less than it would have been in Round 2. Therefore, it's worth 81% of what it would have been in Round 1.
