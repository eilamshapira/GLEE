"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in our favor. Considering that the value decreases each round, accepting this now ensures a substantial amount for both of us. Letâ€™s avoid the penalty of inflation and settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice's offer, I would get $400,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 from my perspective.

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is a significant amount. If I reject, I would need to secure substantially more than $421,053 ($400,000/0.95) in the next round just to break even, accounting for the 5% inflation penalty.

While 60/40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer more attractive than risking a negotiation where each round reduces the real value of my potential gains.
