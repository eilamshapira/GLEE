"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. 20% less means the total pot will be worth $8,000 in round 2
5. I could try to negotiate for more, but there's a risk of losing value

Since this is a relatively low offer (only 40%), and I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate while the money value is still high, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the need for cooperation due to the time pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split and avoid losing value to inflation""}"
