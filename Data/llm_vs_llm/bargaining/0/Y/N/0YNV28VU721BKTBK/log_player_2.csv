"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer and move to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me
2. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair

Since this is a fair split at full value, rejecting would mean I'd be negotiating with less total value in the next round. Even if I tried to get more, 90% of a larger share might end up being worth less than 50% of the full amount now.
