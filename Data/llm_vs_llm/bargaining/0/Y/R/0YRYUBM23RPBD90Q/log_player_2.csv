"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500
}
```
My reasoning is as follows:

*   **Inflation:** I need to account for the 20% loss in value I will experience if we go to another round.
*   **Alice's Previous Offer:** Alice's previous offer of 6000 for herself suggests she wants a significant portion.
*   **Fairness vs. Inflation:** I'm offering slightly more than half to try and secure a deal now and avoid further losses due to inflation. I am betting Alice may be more rational in trying to avoid further inflation, even if she gets less than her original offer.

I am hoping this split is acceptable to Alice, considering the circumstances."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
