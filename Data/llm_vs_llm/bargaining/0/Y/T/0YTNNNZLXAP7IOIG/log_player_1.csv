"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me consider this game carefully. The inflation rates are different for us - mine is higher (20% per round) while Bob's is only 5%. This means that time works against me more than it works against Bob. If we don't reach an agreement quickly, the value decreases for both of us, but more rapidly for me.

Given this pressure, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the $10,000. This is fair and gives us both equal amounts, which should be acceptable to Bob given that he has less time pressure than I do."
