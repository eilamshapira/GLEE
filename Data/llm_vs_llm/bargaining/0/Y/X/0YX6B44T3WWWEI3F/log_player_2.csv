"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, I'm open to negotiations 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of 40 dollars for me and 60 dollars for her. Given that we're starting in round 1 and inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, accepting now would give me $40. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be worth less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. We both face inflation risks with each round, so an equal division would be best for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point on fairness, but I took the risk of making the first offer. I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is closer to 50-50, but still reflects my initiative 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $42, but due to inflation, it's worth 19% less to me now, so effectively about $34. If I reject and we continue to the next round, the inflation will increase to 27.1% for me.

Interestingly, Alice isn't affected by inflation according to what you've told me. This gives her a significant advantage as rounds progress.

Given this asymmetric inflation situation and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I should accept this offer.
