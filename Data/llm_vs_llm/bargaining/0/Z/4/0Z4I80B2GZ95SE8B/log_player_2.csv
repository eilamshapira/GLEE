"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle immediately to avoid any loss from inflation. I propose an even split of $10000, giving us both the full value without delay. I look forward to your quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. 

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on my portion, meaning any amount I'd receive would be worth 20% less to me. If I were to counter-offer and get $6,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $4,800 to me due to inflation (80% of $6,000).

Since I'd need to get significantly more than $6,250 in the next round just to beat the current $5,000 offer (since $6,250 Ã— 0.8 = $5,000), accepting the even split now seems reasonable.
