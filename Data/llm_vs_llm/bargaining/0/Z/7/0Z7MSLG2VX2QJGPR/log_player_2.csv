Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer would give me $4200, which is worth considerably less than it was in Round 1.  It's still beneficial to hold out for a better deal, even considering the shrinking pot."
