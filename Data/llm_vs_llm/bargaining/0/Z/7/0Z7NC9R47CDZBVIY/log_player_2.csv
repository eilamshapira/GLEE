"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. 4000$ now is better than potentially getting 5000$ next round which would be worth 4500$ to me due to inflation
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued inflation and potential further rejections makes this a reasonable offer
