"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. We both have interest in resolving this quickly since we face inflation penalties, though yours is higher at 20% compared to my 10%. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair, and considering the inflation penalties, it's reasonable to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money.
