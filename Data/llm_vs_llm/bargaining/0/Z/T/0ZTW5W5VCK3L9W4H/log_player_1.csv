"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the value decreases more for you each round, take 450k now to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value for me, I'll have to think carefully. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the value of the money is decreasing by 10% each round for me, I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

In Round 1, the value was $1,000,000.
In Round 2, the value for me was $900,000 (10% less).
In Round 3, the value for me is $810,000 (10% less than $900,000).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 460000, 
""bob_gain"": 540000, 
""message"": ""I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Here's an offer that gives you a bit more to account for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money for me has decreased significantly. 

In Round 1, the value was $1,000,000.
In Round 2, the value for me was $900,000 (10% less).
In Round 3, the value for me was $810,000 (10% less than $900,000).
In Round 4, the value for me is $729,000 (10% less than $810,000), which is approximately 27.1% less than the original value.

Bob's offer of $470,000 is still a significant amount, but I need to weigh it against the potential losses in future rounds.
