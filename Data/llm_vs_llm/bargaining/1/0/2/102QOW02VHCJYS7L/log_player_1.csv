Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the rounds are progressing, and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. While not ideal, accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value."
