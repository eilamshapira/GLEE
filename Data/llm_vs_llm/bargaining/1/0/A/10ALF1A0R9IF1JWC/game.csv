650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 65-35 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round (mine is 5% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover.",Alice,1,

950000.0,50000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, as you know, while waiting will cost you about 5% per round, my funds remain unaffected. If you reject this offer, youâ€™d be proposing in round 3 and, due to inflation, even if you could claim nearly the whole pot then, its real value would drop to roughly $950000. To avoid further loss and settle swiftly, I'm offering you $950000 now while I take $50000. I believe this is a fair outcome given the circumstances. Please accept.",Bob,2,
