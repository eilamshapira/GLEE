"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll approach this negotiation strategically, considering the 5% inflation per round for me. A reasonable first offer should be favorable to me while still being acceptable enough that Bob might consider it.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 65-35 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round (mine is 5% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, as you know, while waiting will cost you about 5% per round, my funds remain unaffected. If you reject this offer, youâ€™d be proposing in round 3 and, due to inflation, even if you could claim nearly the whole pot then, its real value would drop to roughly $950000. To avoid further loss and settle swiftly, I'm offering you $950000 now while I take $50000. I believe this is a fair outcome given the circumstances. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 950000 
# Bob gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
