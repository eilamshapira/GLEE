"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 65-35 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round (mine is 5% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50000, ""alice_gain"": 950000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, as you know, while waiting will cost you about 5% per round, my funds remain unaffected. If you reject this offer, youâ€™d be proposing in round 3 and, due to inflation, even if you could claim nearly the whole pot then, its real value would drop to roughly $950,000. To avoid further loss and settle swiftly, I'm offering you $950,000 now while I take $50,000. I believe this is a fair outcome given the circumstances. Please accept.""}"
