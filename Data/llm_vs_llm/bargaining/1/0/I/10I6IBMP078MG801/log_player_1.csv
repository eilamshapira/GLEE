"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. This offer is made now to avoid the steeper devaluation you'll face in future rounds. Let's both secure a fair amount—please accept!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally to account for the devaluation affecting both of us. This seems fair given the game's dynamics. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 96, ""bob_gain"": 4, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the overall stakes are already dented by inflation. If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 4, where your money only retains 40% of its value. In this offer I get $96 and you get $4, which gives you an effective value of $2.4 (0.6 × 4), just a bit better than what you'd secure in round 4. I believe this small share is in your best interest given the rapid devaluation you face. Let's settle now!""}"
