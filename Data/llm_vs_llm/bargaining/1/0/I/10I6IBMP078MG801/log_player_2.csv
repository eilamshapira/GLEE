"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. This offer is made now to avoid the steeper devaluation you'll face in future rounds. Let's both secure a fair amount—please accept! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally to account for the devaluation affecting both of us. This seems fair given the game's dynamics. Let's agree on this and end the game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the overall stakes are already dented by inflation. If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 4, where your money only retains 40% of its value. In this offer I get $96 and you get $4, which gives you an effective value of $2.4 (0.6 × 4), just a bit better than what you'd secure in round 4. I believe this small share is in your best interest given the rapid devaluation you face. Let's settle now! 
# Bob gain: 4 
# Alice gain: 96
