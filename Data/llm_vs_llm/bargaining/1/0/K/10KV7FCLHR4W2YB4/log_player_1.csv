Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I propose that I receive $900,000 and you receive $100,000. Let's settle this quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. There's no reason for an uneven split when we're both equal participants. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
