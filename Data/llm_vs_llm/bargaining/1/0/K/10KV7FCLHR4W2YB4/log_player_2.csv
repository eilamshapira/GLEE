"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose that I receive $900000 and you receive $100000. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that's more equitable. A 90-10 split heavily favoring Alice is not fair, especially when we both have equal negotiating power in this situation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. There's no reason for an uneven split when we're both equal participants.""}"
