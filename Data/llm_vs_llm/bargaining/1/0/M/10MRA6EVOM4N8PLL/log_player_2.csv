"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This seems fair considering the effort and time we've put into this game. Let me know what you think!

# Alice gain: 600000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the higher inflation impact on my side, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable. Let's see if we can agree on this and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims a higher inflation impact, we have no way to verify that. Accepting a worse deal than my previous offer isn't rational.  I'll try to push for a more even split, but I need to be mindful that time is running out and getting something is better than nothing."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. With the inflation hitting me harder, a 53/47 split in my favor seems fair. Let's agree on this and end the game before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still unacceptable. Even with her supposed higher inflation, accepting less than what I was offered in Round 1 is a bad deal. The pressure is on, but I'm hoping she'll become more agreeable as we approach the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm sticking with a 51/49 split. This is my final offer - let's be done with this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're down to the wire here. Given the severe inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This is my final offer before we lose it all. Let's agree and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with only 5 rounds remaining and my potential gains shrinking rapidly, it's too risky to hold out for more. Accepting a 52/48 split in Alice's favor is better than walking away with nothing."
