"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. Given the high inflation rate Bob faces (20% per round), $400,000 now is worth more than potentially getting more in later rounds
3. If Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 5% less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $427,500 to me now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth another 5% less for me
   - It will be worth another 20% less for Bob
   - This significantly weakens Bob's negotiating position

3. While $427,500 is substantial, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. Bob's high inflation rate (20%) means he's losing value much faster than I am, which should make him more willing to accept a better offer for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob rejected my first 60-40 split and countered with a 45-55 split, I'll adjust my offer slightly but maintain a position that favors me due to our inflation differences.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this 55-45 split because:
1. It's more favorable to Bob than my initial offer
2. Bob's money has already lost 40% of its value (20% Ã— 2 rounds), while mine only lost 10%
3. If Bob rejects, his next round money will be worth another 20% less
4. This is a reasonable compromise that should be attractive given his higher inflation rate
5. It's better for Bob than continuing further rounds where his value deteriorates significantly"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, my $500,000 is worth about $428,700 (85.74% of original value)
3. For Bob, his share is worth only about $256,000 (51.2% of original value)
4. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth another 5% less for me
   - Next round money will be worth another 20% less for Bob
   - Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken significantly

The fact that Bob is willing to take a 50-50 split when his money is losing value much faster suggests he's feeling pressure from the inflation. However, this asymmetric inflation means I still have a stronger position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can get a better deal next round as Bob's position continues to weaken more rapidly than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. My money has lost about 19% value (5 rounds of 5% decline)
2. Bob's money has lost about 67% value (5 rounds of 20% decline)
3. Bob has shown willingness to accept a 50-50 split even with his severe value loss
4. His negotiating position is very weak now due to the compounding inflation

I'll make a stronger offer in my favor:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This 65-35 split might seem aggressive, but:
1. For Bob, $350,000 now is worth more than $500,000 next round due to his 20% inflation
2. We're approaching halfway through our 12 rounds
3. If Bob refuses, his next round's money will be worth another 20% less, while mine only 5% less
4. The difference in our inflation rates makes this more fair than it appears at face value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $580,000, which due to inflation is worth about $448,804 to me (77.38% of original value)
2. For Bob, his $420,000 is worth only about $137,634 (32.77% of original value)
3. Bob has significantly moved from his previous 50-50 split to a 58-42 split in my favor
4. If I reject:
   - We're halfway through our 12 rounds
   - Next round money will be worth another 5% less for me
   - Next round money will be worth another 20% less for Bob

This is a notable improvement from Bob's previous offers, and he's showing significant movement in my direction. However, given that:
1. His negotiating position is extremely weak due to his severe value loss
2. We still have 6 rounds left
3. His inflation rate is still 4x mine

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can still achieve a better outcome in the next round, as Bob's position continues to deteriorate much faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. My money has lost about 27% value (7 rounds of 5% decline)
2. Bob's money has lost about 74% value (7 rounds of 20% decline)
3. Bob's last offer of 58-42 shows he's becoming more desperate
4. His money is losing value at 4x my rate
5. We have 5 rounds left

I'll push for an even stronger position:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This 70-30 split is justified because:
1. For Bob, $300,000 now is worth more than $420,000 next round due to his 20% inflation
2. The severe asymmetry in our inflation rates means Bob needs to close the deal soon
3. If he refuses, his next round's value loss will be another 20%, while mine only 5%
4. Even though this might seem aggressive, the time pressure and inflation differential makes this a rational offer for both parties"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $620,000, which due to inflation is worth about $432,946 to me (69.83% of original value)
2. For Bob, his $380,000 is worth only about $79,686 (20.97% of original value)
3. We have only 4 rounds left
4. Bob has moved to a 62-38 split, continuing to move in my direction

However:
1. Bob's money is now worth only about 21% of its original value
2. His negotiating position is extremely weak
3. If I reject, his next round money will be worth another 20% less, while mine only 5% less
4. Given that his money is losing value 4x faster than mine, and we still have 4 rounds, I can push for better

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can achieve a better outcome in the next round. Bob's rapidly deteriorating position and the remaining rounds give me leverage to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the extremely dire situation for Bob:
1. My money has lost about 35% value (9 rounds of 5% decline)
2. Bob's money has lost about 83% value (9 rounds of 20% decline)
3. Bob's last offer of 62-38 shows continued movement in my direction
4. We have only 3 rounds left
5. Bob's money is worth only 17% of its original value

I'll make an aggressive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

This 75-25 split is rational because:
1. For Bob, $250,000 now is worth more than $380,000 next round due to his 20% inflation
2. We're running out of time (only 3 rounds left)
3. If Bob refuses, his next round's value will drop another 20%, while mine only 5%
4. The extreme difference in our inflation rates (20% vs 5%) means Bob needs to close soon
5. Even though this split seems uneven, given the inflation rates, this is actually more fair than it appears

If Bob rejects this, his negotiating position in the next round will be catastrophically weak with his money worth only about 13% of original value."
