"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential future offers and the effect of inflation.

In the first round, the total amount of money is $1,000,000. If I accept Alice's offer, I will get $400,000.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in the next round. So, the total amount of money will still be $1,000,000, but its value will decrease for both of us.

Let's calculate the value of the money in the next round:
- For me (Bob), the money will be worth 80% of its original value, which is 0.8 * $1,000,000 = $800,000.
- For Alice, the money will be worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000.

Considering that I have 12 rounds to make a decision and the significant difference in inflation rates, I should try to get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. 

Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

My proposal for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me $550,000 and Alice $450,000. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, it's now her turn again to make a proposal. 

Given the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. 

For me (Bob), the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, which means its value is 64% of the original value (100% - 36% = 64%). 
For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which means its value is 90.25% of the original value (100% - 9.75% = 90.25%).

Alice's offer gives me $450,000 and her $550,000. Considering the decreased value of the money for me, this offer might not be as bad as it seems.

To evaluate this offer, I need to consider the actual value of the money I would receive, taking into account the inflation. 
The value of the money I would receive is: $450,000 * 0.64 = $288,000 (in terms of the original value).

However, I should also think about the potential future offers and the fact that the value of the money will continue to decrease for both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 3, it's now my turn again to make a proposal.

Considering the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased further for both of us.

For me (Bob), the money is worth 36% less than in the first round in Round 3, and now it's worth 20% less than that, so the total decrease is 36% + 20% = 56% less than the original value, which means its value is 44% of the original value (100% - 56% = 44%).
For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round in Round 3, and now it's worth 5% less than that, so the total decrease is 9.75% + 5% = 14.75% less than the original value, which means its value is 85.25% of the original value (100% - 14.75% = 85.25%).

My proposal for Round 4 is:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This offer gives both me and Alice $500,000. Given the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm trying to make a fair offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my offer in Round 4, it's now her turn again to make a proposal. 

Given the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased further for both of us. 

For me (Bob), the money is worth 59.04% less than in the first round, which means its value is 40.96% of the original value (100% - 59.04% = 40.96%). 
For Alice, the money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, which means its value is 81.45% of the original value (100% - 18.55% = 81.45%).

Alice's offer gives me $350,000 and her $650,000. Considering the decreased value of the money for me, this offer seems quite unfavorable.

To evaluate this offer, I need to consider the actual value of the money I would receive, taking into account the inflation. 
The value of the money I would receive is: $350,000 * 0.4096 = $143,360 (in terms of the original value).

Given the low value of this offer and the fact that I still have several rounds left to negotiate, I think I can try to get a better deal.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 5, it's now my turn again to make a proposal.

Considering the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased further for both of us.

For me (Bob), the money is worth 59.04% less than in the first round in Round 5, and now it's worth 20% less than that, so the total decrease is 59.04% + 20% = 67.24% less than the original value in Round 5, but since the previous decrease was 59.04%, the new total decrease is 59.04% + (20% * (100% - 59.04%)) = 59.04% + (20% * 40.96%) = 59.04% + 8.19% = 67.23% less, which means its value is 32.77% of the original value (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%).
For Alice, the money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round in Round 5, and now it's worth 5% less than that, so the total decrease is 18.55% + 5% = 23.55% less than the original value, which means its value is 76.45% of the original value (100% - 23.55% = 76.45%).

My proposal for Round 6 is:
{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}

This offer gives me $420,000 and Alice $580,000. Given the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm trying to make a reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."

For Alice, the money is worth 26.49% less than in the first round in Round 7, and now it's worth 5% less than that, so the total decrease is 26.49% + 5% = 31.49% less than the original value, which means its value is 68.51% of the original value (100% - 31.49% = 68.51%).

My proposal for Round 8 is:

The value of the money I would receive is: $250,000 * 0.1678 = $41,950 (in terms of the original value).

At this point, I have to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might not get a better offer in the future rounds. Given the very low value of this offer, I should think about accepting it to get at least some value, rather than risking getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
