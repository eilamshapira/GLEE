"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $4,000 now > ($10,000 * 0.9) * my potential share next round

While 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't entirely ""fair"", accepting $4,000 now is better than risking a lower effective value in the next round due to inflation. If I reject, even if I propose a better split next round, the 10% inflation will reduce my real gains.
