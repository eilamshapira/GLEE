"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it fairly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer and the impact of inflation.

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which would give me $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'd get to make a counter-offer, but due to 20% inflation, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me.

For example, if I rejected and then proposed (and Alice accepted) that I get $60, it would only be worth $48 to me (60 Ã— 0.8), which is less than the $50 I'm being offered now.

Given the fair split and the certainty of inflation affecting my gains, accepting now is better than rejecting.
