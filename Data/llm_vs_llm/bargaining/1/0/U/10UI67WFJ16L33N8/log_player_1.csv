"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing that we settle right away to avoid any potential inflation risks. In this offer, I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000 so that you don’t have to face any uncertain devaluation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances. Looking forward to your acceptance. –Alice""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's make this a fair split for both of us. We both get $500000. This way, we both avoid the risk of inflation equally, and there's no need for further negotiations. Hope you agree with this proposal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
