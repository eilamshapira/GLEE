"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that we settle right away to avoid any potential inflation risks. In this offer, I receive $550000 and you receive $450000 so that you don’t have to face any uncertain devaluation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances. Looking forward to your acceptance. –Alice

# Alice gain: 550000
