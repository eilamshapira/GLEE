"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for myself when making the offer. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself, assuming Bob is rational. However, I want to increase the likelihood of acceptance early on before inflation erodes the value too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. For me, $45 now is worth 80% of $45 from the first round, which is $36 in original value.

Bob's $55 is worth 95% of its original value, so approximately $52.25

I will reject this offer. I'd rather make my own offer and try to get a better deal.

```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, so I need to be more strategic. Since Bob offered me $45 (worth $36 to me), I need to offer him something that's still attractive to him, but gives me more. I'll try a more balanced approach, leaning slightly in my favor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's perspective:** \$40 now is worth (100% - 48.8%) = 51.2% of the original value. So, \$40 * 0.512 = \$20.48 in original dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** \$60 now is worth (100% - 14.26%) = 85.74% of the original value. So, \$60 * 0.8574 = \$51.44 in original dollars.

This is becoming a very bad deal for me. I'm essentially getting only \$20.48. I will reject this and try to squeeze out a little more for myself in the next round, even though the value is decreasing rapidly.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, this is getting critical. The inflation is really hurting me. I need to make an offer that Bob will hopefully accept, but I also need to secure something worthwhile for myself. I'll offer a slight concession to Bob, while still trying to get as much as I can.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down:

*   **Alice's perspective:** $40 now is worth (100% - 67.23%) = 32.77% of the original value. So, $40 * 0.3277 = $13.11 in original dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** $60 now is worth (100% - 22.62%) = 77.38% of the original value. So, $60 * 0.7738 = $46.43 in original dollars.

This is a terrible deal for me! It's clear that Bob is playing hardball, and the inflation is killing me. I will reject and try to get a better deal for myself;

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I am running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I need to make a deal. I will make a final, slightly more generous offer to Bob in the hopes that he will accept it.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
