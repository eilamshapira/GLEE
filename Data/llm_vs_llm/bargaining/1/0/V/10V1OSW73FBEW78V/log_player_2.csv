Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the money is losing value, Alice's offer is barely better than my previous one (which she rejected). It seems likely she's feeling the effects of inflation more strongly than she's letting on.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential winnings decrease for both of us. It's getting riskier to hold out for a significantly better deal. 

I'll aim for a more aggressive counter-offer in the next round, hoping that the increasing pressure will push Alice towards a more agreeable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is clearly impacting Alice more severely than me. Holding out seems to be the stronger strategy at this point, as her offers are slowly getting closer to a more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 

I'm holding firm on this offer for now. The trend suggests Alice's offers will continue moving in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is fair, and while I was hoping for a slightly better outcome, the rapidly increasing inflation for Alice makes this an acceptable compromise. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share before the money loses even more value."
