"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob. I need to consider the inflation for both of us and the fact that we only have 12 rounds. To start, I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. Let's analyze this quickly.

*   **My perspective:** I would get $4000. This is worth 20% less than in round 1.
*   **Round 1 offer worth:** My initial offer of $5500 is now worth $5500 * 0.8 = $4400 (in current value).

Bob's offer of $4000 is less than the current value of my round 1 offer, but we are only in Round 2. If I reject this offer, next round I will have to offer Bob something that is worth even more to him, since the money is worth even less.

Let's compare this to what I would get next turn if I give bob 6000$.
6000 * 0.8 = 4800$. It would be more than the current offer.

I will reject, but I will need to make a reasonable offer next turn.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, round 3. Inflation is hitting us both hard, so I need to be strategic. This time, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still aim for a decent chunk for myself considering the diminishing returns with each round. I will calculate how much value is lost if we go to the next round, and offer something that is close to what I think he would accept.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```"
