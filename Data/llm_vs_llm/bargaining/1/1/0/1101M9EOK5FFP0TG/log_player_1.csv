"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good portion while considering that Bob might be tempted to go to the next round, where the total value would decrease by 20%.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it
3. If Bob rejects, the next round will be worth only $800,000 total, making this a compelling offer"
