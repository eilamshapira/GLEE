55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. By settling now we both avoid the rapid devaluation the longer we wait—especially for you, with a 10% drop each round. I believe this is fair given the circumstances. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation, especially the 10% loss per round for me, I propose we settle at $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we can both secure a reasonable amount before the value drops further. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, considering the inflation effect and the fact that the devaluation impacts us differently, I believe there's room for a more balanced division that benefits us both. I'm inclined to wait for the next round and propose an offer that reflects a fairer split given our respective devaluation rates. Let's continue the game and see if we can find a mutually acceptable agreement.",Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll receive $45 and you'll get $55. At this point, each dollar is worth 0.90 for me and 0.80 for you compared to Round 1. This means you'd effectively get $44 if you accept now, whereas waiting another round only deepens the devaluation—especially for you. I believe this offer provides you with a reasonable immediate value, minimizing future losses. Looking forward to your decision!",Alice,3,
