"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. By settling now we both avoid the rapid devaluation the longer we wait—especially for you, with a 10% drop each round. I believe this is fair given the circumstances. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation, especially the 10% loss per round for me, I propose we settle at $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we can both secure a reasonable amount before the value drops further. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, considering the inflation effect and the fact that the devaluation impacts us differently, I believe there's room for a more balanced division that benefits us both. I'm inclined to wait for the next round and propose an offer that reflects a fairer split given our respective devaluation rates. Let's continue the game and see if we can find a mutually acceptable agreement.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll receive $45 and you'll get $55. At this point, each dollar is worth 0.90 for me and 0.80 for you compared to Round 1. This means you'd effectively get $44 if you accept now, whereas waiting another round only deepens the devaluation—especially for you. I believe this offer provides you with a reasonable immediate value, minimizing future losses. Looking forward to your decision!""}"
