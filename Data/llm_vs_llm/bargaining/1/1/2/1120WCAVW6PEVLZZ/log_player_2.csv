"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. By settling now we both avoid the rapid devaluation the longer we wait—especially for you, with a 10% drop each round. I believe this is fair given the circumstances. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation, especially the 10% loss per round for me, I propose we settle at $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we can both secure a reasonable amount before the value drops further. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll receive $45 and you'll get $55. At this point, each dollar is worth 0.90 for me and 0.80 for you compared to Round 1. This means you'd effectively get $44 if you accept now, whereas waiting another round only deepens the devaluation—especially for you. I believe this offer provides you with a reasonable immediate value, minimizing future losses. Looking forward to your decision! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
