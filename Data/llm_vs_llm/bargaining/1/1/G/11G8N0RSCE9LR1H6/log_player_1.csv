"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the declining value of the money each round. Since this is the first round, I'll offer a relatively fair split, but with a slight advantage for myself to account for potential future rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My initial offer was rejected, and now Bob is offering me $480,000. Let's calculate the value of that offer considering the 5% inflation for me:

$480,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $480,000 * 0.95 = $456,000

Since the original amount was $1,000,000, I had proposed $550,000. Bob's offer is now worth $456,000 to me. While it's less than I initially wanted, rejecting it means further inflation. Let's see what that means for Bob's offer, if I reject it. He is getting:

$520,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000

So, if I reject this offer. This will be the base value for round 3.

Given the risk of further losses, and the fact that Bob is only gaining $468,000 to my $456,000, I'll accept the offer.
