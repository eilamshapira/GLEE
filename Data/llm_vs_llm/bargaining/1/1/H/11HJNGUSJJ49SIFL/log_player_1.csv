"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, reflecting the value lost to inflation on your side.  Let's get this done and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting: While this split gives Bob more than me, due to the 20% inflation penalty, rejecting and going to the next round would make any future gains worth even less to me. If I got $4000 in the next round, it would only be worth $3200 to me due to 40% total inflation. Better to accept $4000 now (worth $3200 to me due to 20% inflation) than risk further devaluation of my share."
