"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. Since it's the first round, I'll try to be somewhat generous but also ensure I get a good portion.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's proposing a 60/40 split in his favor. I need to consider the inflation. The money for me is now worth 80% of its original value, and for Bob it's worth 90%.

Let's calculate the actual value:

*   **Alice's gain if I accept:** $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000
*   **Bob's gain if I accept:** $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000

Since I have 10 rounds left (including this one), I'll reject, hoping to get a better offer later, considering the inflation will only worsen.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I need to adjust my offer. My money is now worth only 80% of what it was in round 1, and Bob's is worth 90% of what it was in round 1. I need to make an offer that is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but also gives me more than his previous offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and countered. Let's analyze the situation carefully, considering the severe inflation effects:

*   **Alice's current value:** 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%
*   **Bob's current value:** 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%

*   **Alice's gain if I accept:** $450,000 * 0.512 = $230,400
*   **Bob's gain if I accept:** $550,000 * 0.729 = $400,950

$230,400 is very low, and the amount of rounds left is diminishing. I need to make a gamble, but I can't accept such a low amount.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, round 5. Inflation is really biting now. I need to make a more appealing offer to Bob. I'll try to be more generous this time, but still aim for a decent outcome for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is still lowballing me, and the inflation is getting brutal. Let's see the numbers:

*   **Alice's current value:** 100% - 67.23% = 32.77%
*   **Bob's current value:** 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%

*   **Alice's gain if I accept:** $480,000 * 0.3277 = $157,296
*   **Bob's gain if I accept:** $520,000 * 0.5905 = $307,060

That's an extremely low amount for me. We are halfway through the rounds. I have to reject and try to get more next round.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting critical. Inflation is eating away at the value rapidly. I need to make a realistic offer to Bob to avoid getting nothing.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
