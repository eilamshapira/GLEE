"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. But due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
4. If I reject, $50 will become worth $40 to me in the next round
5. To beat this offer, I'd need to get significantly more than $50 in the next round, and Alice might reject that

Given the inflation penalty and the fairness of the current offer, I should accept.
