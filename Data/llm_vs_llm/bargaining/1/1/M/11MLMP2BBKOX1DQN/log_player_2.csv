While the split is not perfectly equal, considering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer ensures that we both receive a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, the value of the money will decrease further, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer. Therefore, it's in our best interest to accept the current proposal."
