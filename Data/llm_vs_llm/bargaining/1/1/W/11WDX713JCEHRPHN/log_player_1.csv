"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a more balanced split. This way we both get a good portion, and it's better to agree soon before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
