"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a fair start! Let's take this offer. I'm offering you a substantial 40, and inflation will hurt us both if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she's keeping $60. If I reject this and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total value for me will be equivalent to $80. 

Even with the reduced value, I could potentially get a better deal in the next round. If I were to offer something like a 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $40 (after 20% inflation), which is the same as what I'm being offered now, and Alice might accept that as a fair deal.

Given that we have multiple rounds available and I could potentially get a better deal even accounting for inflation, I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but accounting for the fact that we've already lost some value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a more balanced split. This way we both get a good portion, and it's better to agree soon before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""}"
