"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk I face - if we delay, my share will be worth less in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's a 50-50 split and less than my initial proposal, with the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, delaying further would reduce my real gains significantly. A $5,000 share now (worth $4,000 after my 20% inflation) is better than risking further rounds where my purchasing power would continue to decrease at a higher rate than Bob's."
