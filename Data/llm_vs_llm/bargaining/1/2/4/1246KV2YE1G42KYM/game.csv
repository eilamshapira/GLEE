60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both have equal bargaining power at this point and inflation hasn't had a significant impact yet.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, your previous offer of $45 was actually worth only $36 to me. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this. This 65-35 split would give me an effective value closer to a fair division, considering the inflation impact.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation impact on your side, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 58-42 split is my new offer, considering I'm not affected by inflation. This is as far as I'm willing to compromise for now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, let me explain the math: With nearly 50% inflation for me, I need a much larger nominal amount to get a fair value. Even with this 75-25 split, the $75 is only worth about $38.40 to me in round 1 terms due to inflation, while your $25 maintains its full value. This offer is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation impact, but I still think you're asking for too much. A 60-40 split is my new offer. Considering the significant inflation on your side, this 40 might be worth less to you, but I'm not willing to give up more than this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the inflation is getting severe. With 67% inflation, even this 85-15 split would only be worth about $28 to me in real terms, while your $15 keeps its full value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both get nothing. This offer is actually fair when accounting for the inflation effect.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency and the severe inflation impact on your side. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $15. A 65-35 split is my new offer. This might be a low real value for you, but it's the most I'm willing to compromise.",Bob,8,
