"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both have equal bargaining power at this point and inflation hasn't had a significant impact yet. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation effect makes this offer worse for me than it appears. With 20% inflation, the $45 I would receive is only worth $36 in round 1 terms. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, your previous offer of $45 was actually worth only $36 to me. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this. This 65-35 split would give me an effective value closer to a fair division, considering the inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation impact on your side, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 58-42 split is my new offer, considering I'm not affected by inflation. This is as far as I'm willing to compromise for now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 48.8% inflation, the $42 I would receive is only worth about $21.50 in round 1 terms, which is far too low. We need to reach a deal that better accounts for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, let me explain the math: With nearly 50% inflation for me, I need a much larger nominal amount to get a fair value. Even with this 75-25 split, the $75 is only worth about $38.40 to me in round 1 terms due to inflation, while your $25 maintains its full value. This offer is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation impact, but I still think you're asking for too much. A 60-40 split is my new offer. Considering the significant inflation on your side, this 40 might be worth less to you, but I'm not willing to give up more than this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 67.23% inflation, the $40 I would receive is only worth about $13.11 in round 1 terms, which is extremely unfair. Bob's $60 maintains its full value, making this offer very unbalanced when accounting for inflation. We're running out of rounds, but I need a much better offer to compensate for the severe inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time and the inflation is getting severe. With 67% inflation, even this 85-15 split would only be worth about $28 to me in real terms, while your $15 keeps its full value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both get nothing. This offer is actually fair when accounting for the inflation effect.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the urgency and the severe inflation impact on your side. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $15. A 65-35 split is my new offer. This might be a low real value for you, but it's the most I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't ideal (the $35 is only worth about $7.34 in round 1 terms due to 79.03% inflation), we're running out of rounds and the inflation penalty is getting worse. If we continue negotiating, my effective value will decrease even further. Better to accept this smaller amount now than risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
