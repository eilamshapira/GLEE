"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both have equal bargaining power at this point and inflation hasn't had a significant impact yet.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, your previous offer of $45 was actually worth only $36 to me. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this. This 65-35 split would give me an effective value closer to a fair division, considering the inflation impact.

# Alice gain: 65

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let me explain the math: With nearly 50% inflation for me, I need a much larger nominal amount to get a fair value. Even with this 75-25 split, the $75 is only worth about $38.40 to me in round 1 terms due to inflation, while your $25 maintains its full value. This offer is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the inflation is getting severe. With 67% inflation, even this 85-15 split would only be worth about $28 to me in real terms, while your $15 keeps its full value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both get nothing. This offer is actually fair when accounting for the inflation effect.
