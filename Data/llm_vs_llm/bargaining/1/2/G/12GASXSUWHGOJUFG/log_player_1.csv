"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **First Offer Advantage:** I'm aiming for a slight advantage as Alice proposing first.
*   **Considering Inflation:** I'm factoring in the 0% inflation for me and the 5% inflation for Bob if we go to later rounds. This will make my offer more attractive to him now.
*   **Fairness:** I'm starting with a seemingly ""fair"" offer that isn't too greedy, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
*   **Room to Negotiate:** I have some room to concede if Bob rejects the offer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, which he rejected. While his money is worth less now (5% less), accepting this deal would still be a loss for me compared to my initial proposal. I believe I can get a better offer by making a counter-proposal in the next round. I'm banking on the accumulating inflation impacting Bob more significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Increased Demand:** I'm increasing my share slightly compared to my initial offer, reflecting the risk and the fact that we're further into the game.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. This makes my offer more palatable to him, even though my numerical gain is lower than what he proposed in Round 2 for himself.
*   **Still Reasonable:** The offer is still not overly greedy and provides Bob with a decent return, making it more likely to be accepted. I am hoping he understands that the relative value of the money is changing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to offer me less than I initially proposed for myself, and his inflation is becoming significant. 14.26% less value for Bob means he's receiving a significantly lower ""real"" value than the face value. I still believe I can get a better deal by holding out. My primary goal remains to obtain more than 50% as long as I can."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Aggressive Offer:** I'm making a more aggressive offer, demanding 60% for myself.
*   **Inflation is Key:** Bob's money is now worth even less (almost 20% less than in round 1 by my estimation based on the previous round). The pressure is on him.
*   **Still Avoiding Zero:** I am careful to leave Bob with a significant amount that is better than getting nothing after round 12.
*   **Middle Ground in Rounds:** We are close to the halfway point, so I need to start pushing for a deal that benefits me. I want to see how desperate he is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slowly creeping up, the inflation affecting him is making it less appealing. A 22.62% reduction in the value of his money means that his real gain from receiving 52 is (52 * (1-0.2262)), which is effectively around 40.26. I initially wanted 55, and the clock is still ticking, but the diminishing value of his share, plus the fact that I made a recent counter offer of 60, still makes this deal unattractive to me. I still think I can get closer to 60, especially with his losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Pushing Further:** I'm increasing my demand again. The inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains.
*   **Leveraging Inflation:** I need to capitalize on Bob's increasingly diminished returns. He must be feeling the pressure.
*   **Risk Assessment:** I know I'm risking getting nothing if we reach round 13, but I believe Bob is more motivated to avoid that outcome than I am, as his money loses more value.
*   **High Stakes:** It is round 7, so time is of the essence. I suspect that Bob has been expecting me to cave and is surprised that I am continuing to increase my own share of the split. This might make him feel like he needs to act now or he is in danger of losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Bob finally offers 50/50:** After a lot of back and forth, Bob offers an equal split.
*   **Significant Inflation for Bob:** A 30.17% reduction in value is substantial. This means that for every dollar Bob gets, he is actually getting about 70 cents worth of value.
*   **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We only have 4 rounds left. The risk of ending up with nothing is increasing rapidly.
*   **Practical Decision:** While I was aiming for more, getting 50% at this stage, while Bob has significant inflation, is a reasonable outcome. Accepting this offer minimizes my risk and guarantees a decent return.

I was aiming for more, but the risk of getting nothing is too great at this point."
