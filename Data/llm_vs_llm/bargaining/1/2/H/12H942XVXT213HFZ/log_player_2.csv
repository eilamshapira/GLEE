"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
* $4,000 now vs potentially more but worth less later
* With 5% inflation, even if I get $5,000 next round, it would be worth $4,750

While the split isn't completely equal, $4,000 guaranteed now is a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty for waiting. Getting a significantly better deal might be difficult.
