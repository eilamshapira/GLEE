"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob. I need to consider the inflation rates for both of us. Since this is round 1, there's no inflation yet. To maximize my chances of Bob accepting, I need to offer him a reasonable amount while prioritizing my own gain.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
