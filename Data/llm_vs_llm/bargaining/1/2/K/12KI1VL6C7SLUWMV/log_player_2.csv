"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000, Alice gets $600,000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   * $400,000 now is better than $500,000 in the next round if Alice rejects
   * Alice would likely reject a very uneven split in my favor
3. This is a reasonable first offer:
   * 40/60 split is relatively fair
   * Money is worth more now than later
   * Alice has more to lose from rejection (10% vs 5% depreciation)

I'll accept this offer because it's fair enough and the time depreciation makes waiting risky.
