"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. It's important to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Previous Offer:** Bob rejecting my previous offer (where he would have received a significant share despite the inflation) suggests he may be aiming for a larger portion. By slightly adjusting the previous offer in my favor, I'm hoping to reach an agreement before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Severely Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money has decreased significantly. Waiting any longer will result in even less value, even if I could secure a slightly larger share in a future round.
* **Bob's Unlikely Shift:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger portion. It's doubtful his position will change significantly in further rounds, especially with the accelerating inflation working against him."
