"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider inflation rates carefully here. Since my inflation is higher at 20% per round compared to Bob's 5%, I should try to reach a deal sooner rather than later.

Let me propose a fair division that Bob would likely accept:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split, which seems fair to start with. If Bob rejects this offer, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but with our different inflation rates, we both lose value by delaying."
