"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- The $10,000 will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
- It will only be worth 5% less for Alice
- I'll get to make the next proposal
- $4000 now is better than $5000 that's worth 20% less ($4000)

Given that:
1. The value decay affects me much more harshly than Alice (20% vs 5%)
2. $4000 is a substantial portion (40%) of the total
3. If I reject, the money will be worth significantly less in the next round

While the split isn't perfectly equal, the high inflation rate for me makes accepting now more valuable than trying to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds.
