"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I accept now: I get $40
If I reject and offer next round: The total value is worth 20% less to me, so the $100 would be equivalent to $80 for me. Even if I could get more than 50% of that $80 in the next round, it might not exceed $40.

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable initial offer, I'll accept.
