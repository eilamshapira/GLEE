"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering that I want to achieve a fair division while also accounting for inflation that affects me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this split because inflation affects me by 5% each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This is a fair offer that gives us both a good portion while maximizing our combined value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, in light of the inflation affecting both of us, I propose we split it evenly. This way we both secure a fair share while considering the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split, given the inflation factors.

In round 2, my money is worth 5% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth 20% less. If I reject and we go to round 3, my money will be worth another 5% less (total 10% less than round 1).

Given that:
1. Bob is offering me exactly half of the total amount ($50)
2. Bob is actually more affected by inflation than I am (20% vs. 5%)
3. If I reject, I'll face additional inflation in the next round
4. The difference between this offer and my initial proposal is only $5

This is a reasonable offer that gives me a fair share while avoiding further depreciation of value.
