"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should be inclined to accept rather than risk the 10% inflation penalty in the next round."
