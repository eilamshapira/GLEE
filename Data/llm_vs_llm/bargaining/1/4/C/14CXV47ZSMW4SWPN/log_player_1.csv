"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that there's 20% inflation per round for me, I should aim for a fair but favorable first offer to avoid losing value. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's substantial enough to be attractive for me considering potential inflation, but still fair enough that Bob might accept it. If he declines, my next opportunity to make an offer would be in round 3, where the money would be worth 40% less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $3600
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
- We don't know Bob's future inflation rates, but we know his current rate is 10%
- There's also the risk of running out of rounds and getting nothing

While this isn't as much as I proposed, given the inflation pressure and the risk of further delays, this is actually a reasonable offer. The effective value I'm getting ($3600) is still substantial, and waiting would significantly reduce any future gains.
