555556.0,444444.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $555556 and you get $444444. Given that each round’s delay reduces the available money by 20%, this split reflects the fair division based on our alternating offers. Accepting now secures you $444444 rather than risking further devaluation. Looking forward to concluding this efficiently!",Alice,1,

320000.0,680000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you $320000, which is a fair deal considering I'm making the offer.  If we wait any longer, the pot shrinks. Don't get greedy, take the deal now.",Bob,2,

555555.0,444445.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 3: I propose that I receive $555555 and you receive $444445. With today’s pot effectively worth only 64% of $1000000, these amounts reflect our fair split based on our alternating offers and the cost of further delay. Accepting now guarantees you an effective value of about $284444, which is at least as good as your expected outcome if you wait until Round 4. Let’s settle this now before even further devaluation strikes!",Alice,3,
