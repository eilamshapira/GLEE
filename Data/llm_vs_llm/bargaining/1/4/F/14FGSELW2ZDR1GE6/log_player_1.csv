"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 555556, ""bob_gain"": 444444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $555,556 and you get $444,444. Given that each round’s delay reduces the available money by 20%, this split reflects the fair division based on our alternating offers. Accepting now secures you $444,444 rather than risking further devaluation. Looking forward to concluding this efficiently!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you $320000, which is a fair deal considering I'm making the offer.  If we wait any longer, the pot shrinks. Don't get greedy, take the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 555555, ""bob_gain"": 444445, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 3: I propose that I receive $555,555 and you receive $444,445. With today’s pot effectively worth only 64% of $1,000,000, these amounts reflect our fair split based on our alternating offers and the cost of further delay. Accepting now guarantees you an effective value of about $284,444, which is at least as good as your expected outcome if you wait until Round 4. Let’s settle this now before even further devaluation strikes!""}"
