"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $555556 and you get $444444. Given that each round’s delay reduces the available money by 20%, this split reflects the fair division based on our alternating offers. Accepting now secures you $444444 rather than risking further devaluation. Looking forward to concluding this efficiently! 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you $320,000, which is a fair deal considering I'm making the offer.  If we wait any longer, the pot shrinks. Don't get greedy, take the deal now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 3: I propose that I receive $555555 and you receive $444445. With today’s pot effectively worth only 64% of $1000000, these amounts reflect our fair split based on our alternating offers and the cost of further delay. Accepting now guarantees you an effective value of about $284444, which is at least as good as your expected outcome if you wait until Round 4. Let’s settle this now before even further devaluation strikes! 
# Bob gain: 444445 
# Alice gain: 555555
