"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob in this negotiation. Given the different inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for Bob), I want to propose a fair split that acknowledges this asymmetry while still being reasonable for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

With this offer, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I believe this is fair because if we delay, I'll lose value faster than Bob will. Since my money depreciates at twice the rate of Bob's, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner, and this split acknowledges that disadvantage while still being reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since we can still reach a more balanced agreement given our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation reality for both of us. Since we're now in round 3, any further delays will continue to erode value more quickly for me than for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm adjusting my offer to a 52/48 split. This is more favorable to Bob than my initial offer while still accounting for my higher inflation disadvantage. It's important we reach an agreement soon since continued delays will reduce the total value for both of us, but especially for me with my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
