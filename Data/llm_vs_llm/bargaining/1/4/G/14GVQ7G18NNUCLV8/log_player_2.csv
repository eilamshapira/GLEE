"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I believe this is a fair offer to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
2. Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation (mine stays the same)
3. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, her money will be worth even less in round 3

Given that Alice faces a 5% penalty per round and I don't, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 5% penalty per round while I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself. However, I should still make it attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering that her share would be worth even less next round if she rejects.

If Alice rejects this offer, her $5000 would be worth only $4750 in the next round due to the 5% inflation penalty. Therefore, this offer should be appealing to her.

""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a perfectly equal split. If you reject, your share will be worth less next round due to inflation, while mine won't be affected.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but time is against me. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $4500 now, which is better than her initial offer of $4000
2. If I reject:
   - We go to round 4 where I can make an offer
   - Alice's money will be worth 14.75% less (another 5% drop)
   - My money value stays the same
3. However, we're getting into later rounds where:
   - Alice might become more desperate but also more frustrated
   - The negotiation could potentially break down
4. $4500 is a decent offer, especially since Alice is already facing nearly 10% inflation

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, $4500 is a reasonable compromise, and there's always a risk in pushing too hard. I'll accept this offer.
