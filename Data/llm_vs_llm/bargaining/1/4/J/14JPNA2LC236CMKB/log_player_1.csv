"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer from Bob is 400,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 5% less, so it's equivalent to 400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each passing round, and it's already been two rounds, the money I gain is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.

To maximize my gain, I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer from Bob is 420,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 420,000 * 0.8574 = 359,908.80.

Considering this, I think this offer is not very favorable to me, but I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease if I reject it.

However, I still think I can get a better deal if I wait or make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth even less now, and Bob's offers haven't been very favorable, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the original amount, hoping that Bob will accept it due to his own losses from inflation.
