"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round for me.

For my first offer, I need to be mindful that the longer this negotiation takes, the less value I'll receive due to inflation. A fair opening offer should acknowledge this disadvantage while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because while an even 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, I face a 5% inflation penalty if we go to another round. This slight advantage to me helps offset that risk, while still giving Bob a substantial portion that should be acceptable to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be strategic now, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. At this point, the money is already worth 10% less to me than in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation I've already experienced. Given that Bob rejected my initial 55-45 split and countered with one favoring himself, I need to increase my portion to compensate for the 10% inflation penalty I now face. This offer still leaves Bob with a substantial amount while helping me recover some of the value I've lost due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more strategic now. With the compounding inflation penalty, the money is worth about 19% less to me than in the first round. Bob is clearly trying to leverage my inflation disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38}

I'm increasing my requested portion to compensate for the significant inflation penalty I now face. If we continue this pattern, I'll lose even more value. This offer gives Bob a still substantial amount while helping offset my inflation disadvantage. I hope we can reach an agreement soon as further delays continue to erode my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation penalty now reaching approximately 27% compared to the first round, I need to adjust my strategy. Bob seems to be deliberately prolonging negotiations to take advantage of my weakening position.

{""alice_gain"": 64, ""bob_gain"": 36}

I'm offering this division to account for the significant inflation penalty I've accumulated. My effective value from this would be around 47 after accounting for inflation, which is fairly reasonable. I hope Bob recognizes that continuing to delay is creating an increasingly unfair advantage, and we can reach an agreement on this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
