"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $45 and her $55. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's important to consider that with each passing round, Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty while I face none.

If I reject this offer, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round. However, Alice might then reject my proposal, leading to further rounds where her money loses more value. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Given that the split isn't extremely unfair and considering the inflation dynamics, I'll make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while being fair enough that Alice should accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is reasonable considering that if Alice rejects this offer, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth 5% less to her. Since I don't face inflation penalties, this split acknowledges my stronger position while still giving Alice a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me less than her original proposal, which I already rejected. This is an interesting development.

Let me analyze the situation:
- Alice is now offering me $40 (down from $45 in round 1)
- She's taking $60 (up from $55 in round 1)
- She's already experiencing 9.75% inflation on her money
- If I reject, we go to round 4, and her inflation will increase further

This offer is actually worse for me than her initial offer, which doesn't make strategic sense given the inflation pressure she's under. If I reject, I can make another proposal where I have leverage due to her increasing inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer of 55/45 and then proposed an even worse offer for me (40/60), I need to adjust my strategy. Alice seems to be taking a hard stance despite her inflation penalty. However, her penalty is increasing with each round, which strengthens my position.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Alice receives $40. This is fair considering several factors:
1. Alice's money is now worth about 15% less due to inflation if we continue to the next round
2. She rejected a more generous offer previously and countered with a worse one
3. The longer we negotiate, the stronger my position becomes due to the asymmetric inflation penalties

This offer gives her a clear incentive to accept rather than continue negotiations where her share will be increasingly devalued."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has rejected my offer again and is now offering me even less ($38), while taking more for herself ($62). This is puzzling behavior given that she's now facing an 18.55% inflation penalty.

Let me analyze this situation carefully:
- Alice's offers are getting worse for me with each round
- Her inflation penalty is significantly increasing
- She seems to be negotiating quite aggressively despite her disadvantage
- If I reject, I can make another proposal in round 6, with her inflation approaching 25%

Given that her offers are trending in a worse direction for me despite her increasing penalty, and considering I don't face any inflation, continuing negotiations seems strategic.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alice's negotiation strategy is unusual given her growing inflation penalty. She's consistently rejecting my offers and then proposing worse terms for me. This suggests she may be willing to accept significant inflation losses to secure a larger nominal amount.

Given that we're now in round 6 and Alice's inflation penalty is approaching 25%, I'll adjust my proposal to reflect this reality while still maintaining a firm position.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm proposing I receive $65 and Alice receives $35. My reasoning:

1. Alice's inflation penalty is now very substantial (approaching 25%)
2. She has consistently rejected reasonable offers
3. The actual value of $35 to Alice now is roughly equivalent to getting $46 in round 1
4. If she rejects this offer, her next round inflation will make any amount even less valuable to her
5. I face no inflation penalty, so time strongly favors my position

This offer recognizes the economic reality of our situation while still giving Alice a meaningful portion that's worth accepting given her inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to reject my offers and is now proposing I take $36 while she takes $64, despite facing a 26.49% inflation penalty. This suggests she's either not understanding the implications of the inflation penalty or has a very unusual negotiation strategy.

Let's analyze her current offer:
- She's offering me $36 (less than all her previous offers)
- Due to her inflation penalty, her $64 is effectively worth only about $47 compared to round 1 value
- If I reject, we'll go to round 8, where her inflation penalty will exceed 30%
- I continue to face no inflation penalty

Her strategy is increasingly disadvantageous to herself as we continue. The rational move is to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alice's continued rejection of increasingly favorable offers (from her inflation-adjusted perspective) suggests either a misunderstanding of the game mechanics or an extremely stubborn negotiation stance. Given that we're now in round 8 with her inflation penalty exceeding 30%, I'll make one more reasonable attempt before being forced to take a harder position.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing I receive $70 and Alice receives $30. My reasoning:

1. Alice's inflation penalty is now over 30%
2. Her $30 in this round is effectively worth about $21 compared to round 1 value
3. She has rejected multiple reasonable offers while proposing increasingly worse terms for me
4. The inflation mechanics of this game strongly favor my position as rounds continue
5. If she rejects this offer, we'll move to round 9 where her inflation penalty will approach 35%

This offer still gives Alice a meaningful portion that, despite inflation, should be attractive compared to continuing negotiations where her share becomes increasingly devalued. It represents a rational recognition of our respective positions given the game's mechanics."
