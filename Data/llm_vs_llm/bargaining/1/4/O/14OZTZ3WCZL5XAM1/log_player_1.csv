"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because it's fair enough to likely be accepted while giving me a good portion. If Bob rejects it, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round, so it's in his interest to seriously consider accepting this 40% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer now:
   * I get $4500, but with 20% inflation = $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500, but with 10% inflation = $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 20% less for Bob)
   * And there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

3. This offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible considering the inflation penalty I'm facing

Given that waiting will only decrease the value further, and this offer is reasonable enough...
