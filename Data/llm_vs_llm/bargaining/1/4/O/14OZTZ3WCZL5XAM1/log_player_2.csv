"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer from Alice. She's proposing:
- I get $4,000
- She gets $6,000

This is a 40/60 split, which isn't quite fair. Given that:
1. Money loses value faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (10% per round)
2. I'll be able to make the next offer if I reject
3. We're only in round 1 of 12 possible rounds

I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more favorable counter-offer. Given that:
1. Money loses value faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (10% per round)
2. Alice should be more motivated to accept sooner due to her higher depreciation rate
3. We still have 10 rounds after this if needed
4. A fair split would be closer to 50/50

I'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is more balanced than her initial offer while giving me a slight advantage. If she rejects, her money will be worth 20% less next round, while mine only 10% less, so she has some incentive to accept."
