"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But due to 10% inflation, the $100 will only be worth $90 to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be $90 (if Alice accepts)
   * Realistically, I'd need to offer Alice something substantial

While 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, getting $40 now is better than risking inflation and potential further negotiations. Even if I counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to give Alice enough to accept, and with 10% inflation, I might end up with less than $40.
