"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that is appealing enough for Bob to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money in future rounds. I also need to ensure I get a reasonable share.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning is that a 60/40 split in my favor is a good starting point. Bob still receives a significant amount, and it's likely more than he'd get if he rejects and the money devalues in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counteroffer. Before I decide, I need to consider the 5% loss in value. The current total value is still $1,000,000, but it *feels* like less than before. Bob is offering $450,000 to me.

Here's my thought process: if I reject, the total available value shrinks again. While I could *potentially* get a better offer in a later round, the risk of further devaluation is significant. Bob's offer is not great, but it's not terrible either.

Given the risk of further loss and the fact that $450,000 is still a substantial amount, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
