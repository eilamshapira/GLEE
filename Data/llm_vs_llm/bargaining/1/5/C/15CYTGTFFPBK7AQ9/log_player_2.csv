"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no depreciation yet
2. The offer gives me $30 and Alice $70
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, in the next round, my money will be worth 10% less and Alice's only 5% less
5. That means I should be somewhat eager to accept a reasonable offer early

While $30 is less than half, it's not terrible given that my bargaining power decreases faster than Alice's due to the different depreciation rates. However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that it's round 2:
1. My money will be worth 10% less, so I need to account for that
2. Alice's money will be worth 5% less
3. I should make a fair but advantageous offer
4. If Alice rejects, we'll go to round 3 with further depreciation

I'll make a balanced offer that's more favorable than her initial proposal but still reasonable enough that she might accept:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This gives me a slight majority while still being fair enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further depreciation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $35, but it's worth 19% less = $28.35 effective value
   * Alice gets $65, worth 9.75% less = $58.66 effective value

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * My money will be worth 27.1% less (another 10% drop)
   * Alice's money will be worth 14.26% less (another 5% drop)
   * The depreciation is accelerating, making future negotiations more costly

3. Alice has improved her offer from $30 to $35, showing some willingness to negotiate

While I might want more, the accelerating depreciation makes waiting risky. Each round makes my position relatively weaker due to the higher depreciation rate on my side. The current offer, while not ideal, gives me a reasonable value considering the depreciation.
