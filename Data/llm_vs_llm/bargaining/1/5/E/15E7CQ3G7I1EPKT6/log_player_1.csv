"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty Bob faces in each round. If he rejects this offer, his money will be worth less in the next round, which gives me some leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's better than a 50-50 split for me, but still gives Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth 10% less, making this offer more attractive
3. It's a reasonable enough offer that Bob might accept to avoid the inflation penalty"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $550,000 (but it's worth only $495,000 to him due to 10% inflation)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but then Bob's money will be worth even less (20% less than original)
4. My previous offer of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob was rejected
5. This offer gives me less than my original proposal, but it's still a significant amount

Given that I can make another offer next round where Bob's position will be weaker due to additional inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob has already rejected my 600k/400k split, and I rejected his 450k/550k split, I'll increase my share further. Bob is now facing 20% inflation on his portion, which weakens his position significantly.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the 300,000 is now worth only 240,000 due to 20% inflation
2. If Bob rejects this, his next offer will face 30% inflation, making his position even worse
3. Bob might realize that delaying further will only reduce the real value of his share
4. This is still better for Bob than getting nothing"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $420,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $580,000 (but it's only worth $422,820 to him due to 27.1% inflation)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 5, where Bob's money will be worth even less (around 35% less than original)
4. This offer is worse for me than his previous offer ($450,000)
5. Bob's negotiating position is getting weaker with each round due to inflation

Since Bob is actually offering me less than before despite his weakening position, and I can make a better offer next round where his inflation penalty will be even higher, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now Bob's facing approximately 35% inflation on his portion, which gives me even more leverage. Since he's shown resistance to my previous offers and even tried to reduce my share in his last offer, I'll push for an even more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the 200,000 is now worth only about 130,000 due to 35% inflation
2. If Bob rejects this, his next offer will face even more severe inflation (around 42%)
3. Bob's previous offers show he's not negotiating rationally (he offered me less in round 4 than round 2)
4. The declining real value of Bob's share due to inflation should make this offer more compelling than waiting
5. This is still better for Bob than getting nothing or facing even worse inflation in future rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $400,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $600,000 (but it's only worth $354,300 to him due to 40.95% inflation)
3. This offer is even worse for me than his previous offers ($420,000 and $450,000)
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 7, where Bob's money will be worth about 47% less
5. Bob seems to be negotiating irrationally - offering me less each time despite his rapidly weakening position

Since Bob is continuing to reduce his offers to me despite facing increasing inflation penalties, and I can make a better offer next round where his inflation penalty will be even higher, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's increasingly irrational behavior (offering me less each time despite his worsening position) and the fact that he's now facing roughly 47% inflation, I'll make an even more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the 100,000 is now worth only about 53,000 due to 47% inflation
2. Bob's previous behavior of offering me decreasing amounts (450K → 420K → 400K) despite facing increasing inflation penalties suggests he might be acting on principle rather than rationality
3. However, the stark reality of getting only about 53,000 in real value if he waits another round might finally convince him to accept
4. This is still better than getting nothing or facing even worse inflation in future rounds
5. The extremely high inflation penalty makes any further delays increasingly costly for Bob"
