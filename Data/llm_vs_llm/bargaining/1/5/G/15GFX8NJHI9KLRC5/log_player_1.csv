"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to propose a division of $100 to Bob. Since this is the first round, I should consider that:
- With each round, the money loses 20% value for me and 5% value for Bob
- That means I have more urgency to finish sooner
- We have 12 rounds maximum

Let me propose a fair but strategic offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal split that's fair to both of us. Given that inflation affects me more heavily (20% per round vs your 5%), accepting now means we both get maximum value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  A 60/40 split benefits us both more in the long run, considering the inflation difference.  You lose a significant chunk with each round we delay. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
