"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is now $800,000. I'll make a proposal to divide this amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount for me is now $640,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8). Alice's offer of $280,000 is roughly 43.75% of the effective amount.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after the first two rounds (and now another round), and then another 20%, the effective amount is now $512,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8). I'll make a proposal to divide this amount, but considering the original $1,000,000 for simplicity.
