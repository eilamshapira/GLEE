550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering that I face 5% inflation each round while you don't. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable to me, so accepting this now is mutually beneficial. This gives you a substantial 45% of the total.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more equitable split is possible considering the time value of money for both of us. Let's start with 55/45 in my favor.  This will give you a significant portion of the total while accounting for the inflation you'll face in future rounds.",Bob,2,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I understand your counter-offer, but it doesn't account for my inflation disadvantage. Each round costs me 5% of value while you lose nothing. If I accept 45%, after just a few rounds of inflation that would be equivalent to taking much less of the original value. This 57.5/42.5 split is fair given the asymmetric inflation we face. Let's conclude this now before my share loses more value.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest and most sustainable solution at this point. We've both had our turn to propose, and this offer acknowledges the risk of further negotiation and potential losses for both of us due to inflation. Let's avoid further delay and agree on this equitable division.",Bob,4,
