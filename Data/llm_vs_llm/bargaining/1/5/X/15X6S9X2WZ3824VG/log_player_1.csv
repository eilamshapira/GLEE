"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest I get $5,500 and you get $4,500, which is a fair split with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. This gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to account for potential inflation risk if you decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $5000 but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $4750
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's original rejection of my 5500/4500 split suggests he's looking for at least 4500-5000
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation on my side

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and a 50-50 split (even with the 5% inflation) is still reasonably fair.
