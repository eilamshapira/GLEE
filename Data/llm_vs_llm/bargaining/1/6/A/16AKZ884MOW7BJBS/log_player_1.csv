I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob. It's important to build a good relationship with Bob and avoid unnecessary conflict.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good split, but with inflation in mind, I'm reducing my offer to Bob slightly.  I think this offer is fair while still showing I want to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 550000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share.  We're running out of time, so I need to make sure I get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still trying to keep a decent margin for myself. We're reaching the halfway point, and the pressure is increasing.  I hope Bob will realize we need to come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a lot closer to even, which is a good thing considering the inflation.  I'm not thrilled to get only half the money, but the risk of getting nothing is too high at this point."
