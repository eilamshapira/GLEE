"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, accounting for the time constraint and potential inflation:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Alice a substantial amount while prioritizing securing a majority for myself, knowing the money depreciates each round. Hopefully this offer is attractive enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, considering the increasing inflation:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm still trying to secure a decent portion for myself, but I'm increasing Alice's share to make it more appealing. We're losing value with each passing round, so a reasonable compromise is necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 350000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's getting risky. My offer for round 6:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest I can go, considering the rapidly decreasing value. I hope Alice sees reason and accepts."
