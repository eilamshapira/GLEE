"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 20% loss in value each round, I can use this to my advantage but still make it attractive enough for him to consider.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

My reasoning behind this offer: I propose to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. This is a 60-40 split which, while in my favor, isn't extremely aggressive. Bob needs to consider that if he rejects this, his portion will be worth 20% less in the next round. So his $4,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later when it's worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. For me, the $5000 retains full value
3. For Bob, his $5000 is actually worth only $4000 (80% of original value) due to inflation
4. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but Bob's share will be worth even less (60% of original value)
5. However, by accepting now, I get $5000, which is less than my initial offer of $6000

Given that I can likely get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's increasing inflation penalty, and that my money retains its value:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money is now worth only 60% of its original value (after two rounds of 20% reduction), I can leverage this to make an offer that's even more in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

My reasoning: For Bob, the $3000 at 60% value is worth $1800 in real terms to him. If he rejects this offer, in the next round his share will only be worth 40% of the original value, making any future gains significantly less valuable for him. This puts pressure on him to accept sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, my $7000 maintains its full value. This offer is strategically designed to take advantage of the inflation pressure while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering $5600 to me and $4400 to himself
2. My $5600 retains full value
3. For Bob, his $4400 is actually worth only about $2147 (48.8% less) due to inflation
4. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, and Bob's share will be worth even less
5. $5600 is still less than my previous offer of $7000

Given that:
- Bob's money continues to devalue rapidly
- I can likely get a better deal next round due to Bob's increasing inflation penalty
- My money keeps its full value
- This offer is lower than what I previously proposed

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth only about 39% of its original value (after four rounds of 20% reduction), I can make an even stronger offer in my favor, but need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

My reasoning: 
1. For Bob, the $2500 at ~39% value is worth about $975 in real terms to him
2. If he rejects this, his next share will be worth even less (only ~31% of original value)
3. The declining value of money for Bob makes any delay increasingly costly for him
4. My $7500 maintains its full value
5. This offer still gives Bob something meaningful while maximizing my gain
6. Bob should realize that further negotiations will only decrease his real value significantly

The pressure of inflation should make this offer more appealing to Bob than continuing negotiations."
