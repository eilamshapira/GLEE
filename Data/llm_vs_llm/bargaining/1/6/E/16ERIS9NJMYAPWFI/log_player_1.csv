"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that every delay costs us in value, I propose the following division: I receive 56 and you receive 44. This offer reflects the diminishing worth of the total amount and ensures we both secure a fair outcome without further loss. I hope you'll agreeâ€”let's end this efficiently! 
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
