Round 2

Accepting this offer secures you 166,667 dollars nominally (worth 133,333 in today's value), which is more than what you'd expect by waiting one more round.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 830000, ""alice_gain"": 170000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this proposal, you'll get to propose in round 5—but note that your dollar value will then be discounted by an extra 20%, dropping your effective value further. Using the standard alternating‐offers logic with our per‐round discount factors (5% for me and 20% for you), the equilibrium nominal division when a player is proposing is roughly 83.33% for the proposer and 16.67% for the responder. However, since you would be switching roles in round 5, you would end up securing around 166,667 nominal dollars (when adjusted, about 85,333 in today’s terms). To give you a slight incentive to accept immediately, I’m offering you 170,000 nominal dollars now. This translates to an effective value of approximately 170,000 × 0.512 = 87,040 in round‑1 dollars for you—just a bit better than waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement given the inflation penalties we face. Please accept.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Given that if I reject, I get to propose in the next round—and my expected equilibrium position as proposer should secure a higher effective payoff even after further inflation—I must decline this proposal. I believe waiting one more round will better preserve my value, so please understand that I have to reject this offer.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, note that the per‐round discount factors remain 0.95 for me and 0.8 for you. In our current round (round 6), my immediate proposal lets me secure 83.33% of the $1,000,000 while offering you 16.67%. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 7 – but you'll then face a one‐round delay, which means your payoff will be discounted by 0.8 relative to this round. In equilibrium, this means your continuation value when waiting equals 16.67% of the pie. To keep you indifferent (and to respect our joint loss from inflation), I’m offering you $166,667 now. Please accept this proposal so we can avoid further devaluation.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, under your current proposal I would get $600,000 nominally, which, after a 26.49% discount (i.e. costing me roughly 73.51% of its original value), gives an effective value of about $441,060 in round‑1 terms. If I reject and move to round 8 as the proposer, my own discount factor would be about 0.6983 (since 0.95^7 ≈ 0.6983), and following equilibrium reasoning I can secure roughly 83.33% of the pie. That amounts to about $833,333 nominally, or approximately $833,333 × 0.6983 ≈ $582,750 in today's value. Clearly, $582,750 is significantly better than $441,060, so I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm truly suffering from inflation. 35/65. This is my final real offer. 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000

If I reject, I become the proposer in round 10. Assuming the pattern continues—where my discount factor decreases roughly by an additional 5% (bringing it near 0.63) and yours by 20% (further squeezing your effective share)—I can then structure a proposal that, in equilibrium, lets me claim roughly 83.33% nominally. Under these assumptions, even after the sharper discount at round 10, my effective value would be around 1,000,000 × 0.8333 × 0.63 ≈ 525,000 in today’s terms, which is clearly more favorable than the current offer.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 960000, ""alice_gain"": 40000, ""message"": ""Alice, here’s the reasoning: If you reject, you become the proposer in round 11. However, due to the steep discounting (your discount factor in round 11 is 0.8¹⁰ ≈ 0.1074 and mine as responder would be 0.95¹⁰ ≈ 0.5987), you’d have to offer Bob nearly everything to induce his acceptance. In fact, in round 11 Bob’s continuation value in round 12 is roughly 1,000,000 × 0.95¹¹ ≈ 568,800 (in round‑1 dollars), which forces you to give him about 950,000 nominal dollars, leaving you with only 50,000 nominal. That 50,000 nominal converts to an effective value of 50,000 × 0.1074 ≈ 5,370 in round‑1 terms. In my proposal now (round 10) I’m effectively offering you exactly 40,000 nominal dollars—which, with your current discount factor 0.8⁹ ≈ 0.1342, also equals about 5,370 in today’s value. In equilibrium you’d be indifferent between accepting and waiting, and by the standard tie‑breaking we assume you’ll accept an offer that gives you your continuation value now rather than risk further delay. Please accept this proposal.""}"
