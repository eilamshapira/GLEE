"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the total amount will effectively be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 would be worth only $800,000 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed to take all of it (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum potential value would be $800,000.

Since $400,000 now is better than a risky chance at something less than $800,000 in the future (and potentially much less if negotiations continue for multiple rounds), I should accept this offer.
