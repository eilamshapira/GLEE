"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose an offer that takes into account the asymmetrical inflation penalties we both face.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

Since I face a steeper inflation penalty (20% per round versus Bob's 5%), it makes sense for me to seek a larger portion now rather than waiting for future rounds where my share would be worth less. However, I also want to make an offer that Bob would find reasonable enough to accept, avoiding the need for multiple rounds of negotiation that would reduce the total value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation rates more carefully. After two rounds, I'm now facing 40% inflation while Bob only faces 10% inflation. Let me adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges Bob's stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric inflation rates we face. The longer we negotiate, the more disadvantaged I become relative to Bob. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my initial offer while still ensuring I get a reasonable share. The combined inflation effects make a prompt resolution beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation differential is becoming quite significant. After 4 rounds, I'm now facing 59.04% inflation while Bob only faces 18.55% inflation. I need to make a more realistic offer given our respective positions.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm moving toward Bob's position while still trying to secure a fair share for myself. The increasing inflation penalty I face (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round) puts me at a significant disadvantage the longer we negotiate. This offer acknowledges that reality while still ensuring I don't accept an unreasonably low amount. It's a compromise that should be attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than prolonging negotiations further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation differential continues to grow significantly. After 6 rounds, I'm now facing 73.79% inflation while Bob only faces 26.49% inflation. I need to make a more pragmatic offer considering our increasingly asymmetric positions.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm moving closer to Bob's position given the severe inflation penalty I face. At this point, the longer we negotiate, the worse my position becomes relative to Bob's. This offer acknowledges the reality of our different inflation rates while still trying to secure a reasonable outcome for myself. With only 5 rounds remaining and my money losing value much faster than Bob's, this is a practical compromise that should be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation situation has become extremely unfavorable for me. After 8 rounds, I'm facing 83.22% inflation while Bob only faces 33.66% inflation. Bob's last offer was extremely aggressive, which suggests he's willing to push negotiations to the limit.

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

Given the severe inflation penalty I face and the fact that we're approaching the 12-round limit, I need to make a more substantial concession. This offer gives Bob a significant majority while still ensuring I receive something meaningful. With only 3 rounds remaining after this one, the risk of getting nothing is becoming very real. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part that acknowledges our asymmetric inflation rates and the dwindling number of rounds."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now at a critical juncture with only one round remaining after this one. My inflation penalty is now 89.26% while Bob's is only 40.13%. Bob has made extremely aggressive offers, suggesting he may be willing to risk getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 15, ""bob_gain"": 85}

This is my final substantial concession. Given the extreme inflation I face and the fact that we'll get nothing if we don't agree in the next round, I'm offering Bob a very significant majority of the money. This offer acknowledges the reality that my bargaining position is severely weakened by the asymmetric inflation rates, while still ensuring I receive something rather than nothing. With only one round remaining after this, accepting a small portion is better than the zero we'll both receive if we can't come to an agreement."
