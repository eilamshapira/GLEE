"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer for a more favorable split, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation, potentially reducing the final value significantly.

Considering that $450,000 is a substantial amount and the risk of continued inflation with each round, I'll accept this offer.
