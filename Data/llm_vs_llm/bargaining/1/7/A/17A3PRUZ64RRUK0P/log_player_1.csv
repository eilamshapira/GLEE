"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that takes into account Bob's time pressure due to the 20% depreciation per round. Since I don't face depreciation, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in my opening offer.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses 20% value each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $350,000 now rather than risking significant depreciation in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a win-win. This offer gives me $400000 and keeps a fair deal for you at $600000. This way, we both benefit and avoid further losses as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Bob's offering me $600,000 (which maintains its full value for me)
2. He's asking for $400,000 (which is worth 20% less to him than in round 1)
3. This is actually a reasonable counter to my initial offer
4. If I reject, Bob's future gains will be worth even less to him, which might make negotiations harder
5. This is a reasonable split that gives me the majority while still being fair
