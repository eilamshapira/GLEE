"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation. While Alice's offer isn't terrible, it's important to signal that I'm not going to accept a deal where I get significantly less. By rejecting, I put the pressure on Alice and force her to consider the impact of inflation on my willingness to accept future offers."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but unfair considering the long-term impact of inflation on my share. This offer is much fairer and allows us both to benefit.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Demand more:**  I need to signal that I won't settle for significantly less than half. This offer is closer to an even split but still favors Alice slightly.
* **Acknowledge previous offer:** By mentioning her previous offer, I show I'm engaging in good faith and not just making arbitrary demands.
* **Emphasize fairness and inflation:** Reminding her about inflation reinforces the idea that time is a factor in my decision-making. 
 
This offer puts a bit more pressure on Alice. She now risks the money being worth even less if she chooses to reject and continue the game."
