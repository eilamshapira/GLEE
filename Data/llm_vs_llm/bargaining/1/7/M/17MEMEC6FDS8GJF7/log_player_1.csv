Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since we couldn't agree on the first round, I believe a more balanced approach might be fair this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. This is a reasonable compromise from both our initial positions, and continuing to negotiate might lead to diminishing returns for both parties."
