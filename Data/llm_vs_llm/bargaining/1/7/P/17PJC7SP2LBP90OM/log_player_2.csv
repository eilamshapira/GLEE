"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally to ensure a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $50 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 Ã— 0.8 = $80 total value for me in next round
   * Even if I propose to keep most of it, it's already worth less

The current 50-50 split is fair, and with the inflation penalty, I'm unlikely to get a better outcome by rejecting and making a counter-offer.
