"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (with the simplifying assumption that “5% less per round” means Bob’s money is worth a fixed amount less each round – so that in round r Bob’s nominal dollars count as (1 – 0.05·(r–1)) in “today’s dollars,” while Alice’s money never devalues), one can show that if both players “play perfectly” the outcome in round 1 will be very lopsided. In outline (details below), one finds that in the final round (round 12, when Bob is the proposer) Bob can claim nearly 100% (his “pie” is discounted to only 45% of its nominal value, but there is no threat for Alice so she must accept nearly nothing). Stepping backward one round at a time, the responder’s “continuation value” is always determined by what they would get in the next round (accounting for Bob’s extra 5% penalty each round). When this backward‐induction is worked out all the way to round 1 – where Alice is the proposer and Bob receives full‐value dollars if he accepts immediately – one finds that Bob’s “waiting‐value” is about $64.44 (in round‑1 dollars). In order for Bob to be just indifferent between accepting and waiting, Alice must offer him at least that much. In equilibrium the offer is made “at the margin” so that Bob is exactly indifferent. That is, Alice offers Bob nominally about $64.44 of the $100 and keeps about $35.56 for herself.

A (rounded) equilibrium offer in round 1 is therefore:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 35.56,
  ""bob_gain"": 64.44
}

If both parties are fully rational and follow the subgame‐perfect equilibrium strategy, Bob will be indifferent between accepting this offer now and holding out – so he should accept. (Any additional “room” in the offer for Bob would only reduce Alice’s share, so in equilibrium she offers him the minimum he will accept.) 

Below is the JSON answer for the round 1 offer."
