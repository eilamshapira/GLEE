I'll explain my reasoning here:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is going down significantly each round. Waiting too long is a bad strategy.
* **Alice's offer is getting better:**  Alice is slowly increasing her offer to me, indicating she also feels the pressure of inflation. 
* **Holding out hope:** I'm hoping that by continuing to reject, I can push Alice closer to a more favorable split, potentially above 6000 for me."

This is getting tight, but I'm holding out one more round. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and inching closer to a more agreeable split.  The inflation is hurting, but I believe I can still get a slightly better deal."

It's painful to accept less than my previous offer, but the inflation is becoming too severe. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting even less later."
