"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more since money retains value for me, but I'm still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

Effective value of my gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3). So, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer considers the inflation impact on Alice. It's still fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than the original value. To calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

Effective value of my gain: 35 * (1 - 0.271) = 35 * 0.729 = 25.515

This offer seems quite low, especially since Bob's gain is not affected by inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 30.79% less than the original value in Round 5 (10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, and 10% less in Round 4, and another 10% less, but considering the previous reductions: 10% + 10% * 0.9 + 10% * 0.9 * 0.9 + 10% * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

However, I also need to consider that the game might not go on forever, and I should try to get a reasonable amount. 

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, considering inflation""}"
