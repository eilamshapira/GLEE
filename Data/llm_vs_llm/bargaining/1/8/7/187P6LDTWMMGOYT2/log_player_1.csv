Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""Let's make a fair division. I take 8000 and you take 2000. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 20% value each round, this offer of $3000 now is better than $3750 in the next round. It's a fair deal considering the time value. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
