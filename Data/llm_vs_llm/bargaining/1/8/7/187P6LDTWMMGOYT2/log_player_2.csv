"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair division. I take 8000 and you take 2000. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rational: Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round and mine doesn't, I should reject unfair offers. I can make a better proposal in the next round where Alice will be more likely to accept due to the depreciation of her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this offer of $3000 now is better than $3750 in the next round. It's a fair deal considering the time value.""}

Rationale (not part of message): I'm offering Alice $3000 now, which is worth more than what she would get if she rejects and makes a counter-offer in the next round, where her share would be worth 20% less. If she rejects this and we go to round 3, her money will be worth even less, so this is a rational offer for her to accept."
