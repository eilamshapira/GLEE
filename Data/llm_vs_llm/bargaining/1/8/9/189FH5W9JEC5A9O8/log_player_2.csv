"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing an even 50/50 split of the $10,000, giving us each $5,000.

Since this is just the first round, and there's no inflation penalty for me (0% inflation means the money's value doesn't decrease for me in future rounds), I could potentially negotiate for a better deal by rejecting. However, a 50/50 split is fair, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer if we continue.
