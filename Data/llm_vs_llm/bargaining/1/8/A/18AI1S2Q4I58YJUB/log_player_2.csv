"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","To maximize the outcome, let's calculate the value of the offer considering inflation.

In round 3, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round. Therefore, the value of the offer for Bob is:

450000 * (1 - 0.36) = 450000 * 0.64 = 288000$

Let's compare this with the potential value in the next round, considering that the money will be worth 20% less again:

1000000 * (1 - 0.2) * 0.5 = 1000000 * 0.8 * 0.5 = 400000$

Since 400000$ is greater than 288000$, it makes sense to proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the effects of inflation, I need to consider the reduced value of the money in this round. The money is now worth 48% less than in the first round. To make an attractive offer for Alice while considering my own gains, I should propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Let's propose a split that is still fair but slightly favors Alice to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","First, let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer considering the inflation:

470000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 470000 * 0.4096 = 192512$

Now, let's consider the potential value if I proceed to the next round and make an offer that Alice might accept. Assuming I offer Alice 550000 and keep 450000 for myself in the next round:

450000 * (1 - 0.6912) = 450000 * 0.3088 = 139920$

Since 192512$ is greater than 139920$, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer in this round.
