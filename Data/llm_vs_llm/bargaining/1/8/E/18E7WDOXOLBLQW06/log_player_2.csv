"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a very good profit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in round 1
2. If I reject, in round 2 I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice might reject as well, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. $400,000 in round 1 is better than $500,000 in round 2 (which would only be worth $400,000 to me due to inflation)
5. While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the risk of multiple rounds of negotiation with increasing inflation makes this current offer relatively attractive

Given these considerations, I'll accept the offer. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking a declining value in future rounds.
