Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 20% value each round, I'm offering you more now ($60) which is better than waiting. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
