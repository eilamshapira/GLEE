"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. Alice's money loses 20% value each round
2. My money keeps its full value
3. We have 12 rounds total

If I reject now, Alice will only get 80% value in the next round. This gives me negotiating leverage to get a better deal.

Therefore, I should reject this offer and propose a split more in my favor next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and she just saw me reject a 50-50 split, I should propose a split that takes this into account but isn't too aggressive to avoid multiple rejections.

For Alice, $50 in this round is worth $40 (80% of original value). So if I offer her $60 now, it's actually worth more to her than waiting another round where $60 would be worth $48 to her. This is a rational economic choice for her.

{""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, I'm offering you more now ($60) which is better than waiting. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing 40 for me and 60 for you. This is a compromise considering the decreasing value of my portion. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a good offer that I should accept. Here's why:

1. Alice is offering me $60, which is better than the 50-50 split from round 1
2. Her $40 is actually worth only $25.60 to her (64% of $40) due to the 36% inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less
4. We're already in round 3, and continuing to negotiate risks reaching the 12-round limit
5. This split acknowledges the inflation effect and provides a reasonable compromise

Given these factors, this is a fair deal that benefits both parties.
