"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair and equal division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - The money's value stays the same for me, so there's no downside to waiting
   - However, getting $5,000 now is a solid outcome

Since this is a fair offer and I have no strategic advantage in waiting (as inflation doesn't affect me), I'll accept.
