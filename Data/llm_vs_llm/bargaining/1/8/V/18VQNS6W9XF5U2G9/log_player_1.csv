"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The original amount I would have gotten is 4500, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth 5% less, so: 4500 * 0.95 = 4275.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a bit more. Since it's the third round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3). 

However, I don't know the inflation rate for Bob, but I know it was 10% less for him in round 2. I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 15% less (approximately, 5% less in round 2, 5% less in round 3, and another 4.26% less, but I will use 14.26% for calculation), I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The original amount I would have gotten is 4700, but due to 14.26% inflation, it's worth: 4700 * 0.8574 = 4027.38.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal or at least wait to see if Bob's offers get better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a bit more. Since it's the fifth round, the money I gain is worth 19.26% less than in the first round (5% less in round 2, 5% less in round 3, 4.26% less in round 4, and another 5% less in round 5). 

However, I don't know the inflation rate for Bob, but I know it was 27.1% less for him in round 4, and 10% less in round 2. I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor, but also considering that Bob might be getting desperate.
