"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it fair and divide the amount equally. A 50-50 split ensures we both benefit equally from this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now is better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds. This guarantees me $45 in real value (after 10% inflation), which is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to continued inflation and potential negotiation breakdown."
