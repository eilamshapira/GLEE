55.56,44.44,"Hi Bob – I propose a division where I receive $55.56 and you $44.44. Given that any delay costs both of us value (each round the $100 loses 20% of its value), this split reflects our respective bargaining positions if we were to continue. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid devaluation. What do you say?",Alice,1,
