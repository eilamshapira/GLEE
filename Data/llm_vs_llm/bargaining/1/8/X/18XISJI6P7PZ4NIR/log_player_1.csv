"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55.56, ""bob_gain"": 44.44, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I propose a division where I receive $55.56 and you $44.44. Given that any delay costs both of us value (each round the $100 loses 20% of its value), this split reflects our respective bargaining positions if we were to continue. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid devaluation. What do you say?""}"
