"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I propose a division where I receive $55.56 and you $44.44. Given that any delay costs both of us value (each round the $100 loses 20% of its value), this split reflects our respective bargaining positions if we were to continue. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid devaluation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 44.44 
# Alice gain: 55.56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
