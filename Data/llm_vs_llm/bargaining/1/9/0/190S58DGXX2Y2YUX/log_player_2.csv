"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's offering me $520,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is a reasonable split slightly in my favor.

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be only $800,000. Even if I then proposed to take all of it (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum possible gain would be less than what I'm being offered now.

$520,000 now is better than the possibility of getting any amount in the next round after 20% inflation.
