5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. If we delay to later rounds, the value for me will drop by 20% per round (and yours by 5%), so concluding now can save us both from significant losses in value. I believe this is a fair starting offer. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. I understand your point about the value decreasing over time, and I agree that finding a mutually beneficial split sooner rather than later is in both our interests. However, considering the differential in how our values decrease, I'm proposing a split where I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This takes into account the greater decrease in value you face with each round. I believe this offer is more reflective of our relative positions and the risk we both face from delaying further. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Given the depreciation I'll face in subsequent rounds, I believe it's in our mutual best interest to settle now. I accept your proposal of $4800 for me and $5200 for you.",Alice,2,accept
