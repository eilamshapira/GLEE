"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. If we delay to later rounds, the value for me will drop by 20% per round (and yours by 5%), so concluding now can save us both from significant losses in value. I believe this is a fair starting offer. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. I understand your point about the value decreasing over time, and I agree that finding a mutually beneficial split sooner rather than later is in both our interests. However, considering the differential in how our values decrease, I'm proposing a split where I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This takes into account the greater decrease in value you face with each round. I believe this offer is more reflective of our relative positions and the risk we both face from delaying further. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Given the depreciation I'll face in subsequent rounds, I believe it's in our mutual best interest to settle now. I accept your proposal of $4,800 for me and $5,200 for you.""}"
