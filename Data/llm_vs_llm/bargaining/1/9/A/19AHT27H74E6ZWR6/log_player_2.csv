"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. If we delay to later rounds, the value for me will drop by 20% per round (and yours by 5%), so concluding now can save us both from significant losses in value. I believe this is a fair starting offer. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and moving to the next round, taking into account the inflation rates for both of us.

If I reject this offer, in the next round, I will be making the proposal. Given the inflation rates:
- My money will be worth 5% less.
- Alice's money will be worth 20% less.

This means that for every round we delay, the total value of the money decreases, but it decreases more significantly for Alice than for me.

Given that Alice's initial offer is $5500 for her and $4500 for me, let's calculate what happens if we go to the next round and I make an offer that could potentially be more favorable to me, considering the devaluation.

Initial total: $10,000

After one round of devaluation:
- For me, 5% of $10,000 is $500, so the total value for me would be considered as $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.
- For Alice, 20% of $10,000 is $2,000, so the total value for her would be considered as $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000.

However, these calculations are somewhat misleading because they don't directly apply to our individual gains but rather to how we perceive the value of the money. The actual split we agree on will be from the original $10,000, but the value of that money decreases over time.

Considering Alice's offer and the fact that delaying will significantly reduce the value for her more than for me, I should think about whether I can get a better deal by waiting. However, given that her initial offer is not drastically unfair and considering the risk of losing value over time, I might want to consider accepting this offer to avoid potential greater losses in the future.

But, let's think strategically: If I reject this offer, Alice's incentive to accept a less favorable deal in the next round increases because the value of the money decreases more for her. Thus, I have a bargaining chip in the form of time and the differential inflation rates.

Given these considerations, my initial instinct might be to reject the offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round, considering Alice's greater loss in value over time. However, this strategy also carries the risk of both of us losing value.

Decision: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I've rejected Alice's initial offer and we're moving into the second round, I'll make a proposal that takes into account the devaluation of the money for both of us.

Since Alice's value deprecates at a higher rate (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), I'll aim for a split that is somewhat more favorable to me than her initial proposal, but still reasonable enough for her to consider accepting, given her higher loss in value over time.

My proposal for Round 2 is:
- I receive $5,200
- Alice receives $4,800

Message to Alice:
""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. I understand your point about the value decreasing over time, and I agree that finding a mutually beneficial split sooner rather than later is in both our interests. However, considering the differential in how our values decrease, I'm proposing a split where I receive $5,200 and you receive $4,800. This takes into account the greater decrease in value you face with each round. I believe this offer is more reflective of our relative positions and the risk we both face from delaying further. Looking forward to your thoughts.""
