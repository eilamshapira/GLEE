475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a split that slightly favors me to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go back and forth, I lose value while you don't. This is fair considering the game structure - you'll still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this quickly without further losses.",Bob,2,
