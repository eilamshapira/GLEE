"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a split that slightly favors me to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go back and forth, I lose value while you don't. This is fair considering the game structure - you'll still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this quickly without further losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
