"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. Let's accept this now to avoid losing value from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself, calling it a ""fair split."" This isn't actually fair, and with inflation affecting only my value, I should consider my options carefully.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, my money will be worth 5% less next round. However, I can propose a more equitable division that accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face while being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a split that slightly favors me to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go back and forth, I lose value while you don't. This is fair considering the game structure - you'll still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this quickly without further losses.""}"
