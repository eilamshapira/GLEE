Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. This offer ensures a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is a strong offer, Bob. Consider the decreasing value and let's settle this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money. It's crucial to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.
* **Understanding Bob:** Bob rejected my initial offer and countered with a more ""fair"" split.  This suggests he may value that perception. My offer is a compromise, tilted slightly in my favor to account for the increasing inflation for me.
* **Clarity:** The message is direct, reminding Bob of the time pressure and presenting the offer as a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Severe Inflation:** The money is rapidly losing value. This round's offer, while not ideal, is better than risking another 20% inflation hit on my potential gains.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to budge further. Rejecting this offer could lead to an even worse outcome in the next round, especially if he proposes to take a larger share. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the potential loss from another round of inflation.

While not the optimal outcome, accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of walking away with even less."
