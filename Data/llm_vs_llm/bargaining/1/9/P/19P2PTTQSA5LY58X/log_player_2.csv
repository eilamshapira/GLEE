"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me a substantial amount, it's not quite an equal split, and we're only in the first round. Given that inflation is 20% per round, there's a risk in rejecting, but I could potentially secure a more favorable division by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer, but not so uneven that Alice would likely reject it and risk further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor. This is more balanced than Alice's initial offer, and with 20% inflation looming, accepting this now ensures we both get a substantial amount rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
