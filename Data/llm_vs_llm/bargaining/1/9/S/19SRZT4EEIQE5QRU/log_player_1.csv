"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in subsequent rounds. I want to be fair but also protect my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the million dollars slightly in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to an equal split."
