"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk inflation
3. If Bob declines, my potential gain in the next round will already be worth 10% less to me"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $500,000 (worth 90% of original value = $450,000 effective value)
   * Bob gets $500,000 (worth 80% of original value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 80% for me
   * I could propose a different split, but the declining value makes delay costly
   * Bob's situation will worsen too

Given that:
- This is a fair 50-50 split
- The inflation penalty is hurting both of us
- Further delays will reduce the real value for both parties
- I still get a reasonable amount in real terms
