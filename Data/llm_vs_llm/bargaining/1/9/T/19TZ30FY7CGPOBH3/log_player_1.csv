``` 
 
I am choosing to move towards a more even split now because the pressure of inflation is increasing, and Bob seems firmly rooted in getting a larger share. A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this stage due to the loss I've incurred from inflation, is better than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds."
