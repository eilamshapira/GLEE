"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I take $40 while she takes $60. Given that we're dividing $100, this isn't an even split.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to account for inflation - my money would be worth 10% less, while Alice's would be worth 5% less. This means if we delay, both of us lose value, but I lose more.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the inflation penalty for rejecting puts me at a disadvantage in future rounds.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer considering the inflation factors for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an even 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. If we keep going to further rounds, we both lose due to inflation, but I lose more (10% vs your 5%). This equal division maximizes our collective value.""}"
