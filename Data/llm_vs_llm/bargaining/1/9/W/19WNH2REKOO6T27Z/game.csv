6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation risk we both face.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation risk, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs your 5%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This actually helps balance out our real gains considering the different inflation rates we face.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given the significant difference in inflation rates, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable. This takes into account the steeper depreciation of your share over time.",Bob,4,
