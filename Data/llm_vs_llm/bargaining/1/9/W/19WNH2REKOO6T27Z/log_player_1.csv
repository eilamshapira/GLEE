"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation risk, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer since the inflation impact is higher on my side, and I believe we can find a better balance."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs your 5%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This actually helps balance out our real gains considering the different inflation rates we face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant difference in inflation rates, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable. This takes into account the steeper depreciation of your share over time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the rapidly increasing inflation rate affecting my share (nearly 50% loss in value already) and the risk of further rounds making my position even worse, I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, getting $4000 now is better than risking even greater devaluation in future rounds."
