"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If you reject, we both lose more value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll calculate the actual value I'd receive:

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $4800 I'd receive is equivalent to $4800 * 0.95 = $4560.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the original $10,000 is now worth:

* For me (Alice): $10,000 * (0.95)^2 = $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9025
* For Bob: $10,000 * (0.9)^2 = $10,000 * 0.81 = $8100

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial split before we both lose more value!""}"
