"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me ($9000 total value for me)
   - The money will be worth 5% less for Alice ($9500 total value for her)
   - I get to make the next proposal

The current offer is not particularly fair, as Alice is taking 60% for herself. Given that I can make the next proposal and the inflation penalty is not too severe for one round, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Alice's money loses 5% value each round, so now $10000 is worth $9500 to her
2. For me, it's worth $9000 due to 10% depreciation
3. I should propose a more equitable split, but one that accounts for Alice's urgency to accept due to her inflation penalty

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If you reject, we both lose more value in the next round.""}

This offer gives me slightly more than half but is reasonable enough that Alice should consider accepting rather than risking further value loss through inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a mutually beneficial split before we both lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $4500 for me, which due to 19% inflation is worth about $3645 in original value
2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 29% less for me
   - Next round money will be worth 14.75% less for Alice
   - I get to make the proposal
   - But we're both losing significant value

Alice has improved her offer from the first round ($4000 â†’ $4500), showing willingness to negotiate. While not perfectly equal, the offer is more reasonable now. Given the accelerating inflation penalties and the risk of further value loss, accepting this offer is better than continuing negotiations.
