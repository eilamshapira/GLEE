"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000. This is a 40/60 split.

Since I know there's no inflation effect for me (it's stated to be 0%), I don't lose anything by continuing to the next round if I reject. However, we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.

While this offer gives me a substantial amount, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round. Since I don't face inflation penalties, there's little downside to negotiating further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's still favorable to Alice, as a sign of good faith in our negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which I believe is the fairest division of the money. This gives us both an equal share of $500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice rejected my fair 50-50 split and has now offered me $420,000 while she takes $580,000. I also see that inflation is affecting Alice's gains (now worth 36% less than in round 1), but not affecting my gains.

Since inflation is impacting Alice but not me, this gives me some negotiating leverage as the rounds progress. Alice's $580,000 would actually be worth only about $371,200 to her after the 36% inflation reduction.

Given that I don't lose value from waiting and Alice is facing significant inflation, I can likely negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation pressure on Alice's side and that we're now in round 4 out of 12, I'll propose a division that acknowledges the inflation effect on her while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. Since Alice is facing significant inflation (36% already), this offer actually provides her with substantial value now rather than potentially less value in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $440,000 while taking $560,000 for herself. However, the inflation affecting Alice has increased dramatically - her gains are now worth 59.04% less than in round 1. This means her $560,000 would actually only be worth about $229,376 to her after inflation.

Given that:
1. We're now in round 5 of 12
2. Alice is facing severe inflation that's getting worse
3. I face no inflation penalty
4. Alice has only slightly improved her offer to me

The inflation pressure on Alice is significant and will likely get even worse in future rounds. I still have the advantage of time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the rapidly increasing inflation pressure on Alice's side (now at 59.04%) and that we're in round 6 of 12 (halfway through our negotiation), I'll make an offer that acknowledges her deteriorating position while being more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. This offer reflects the reality that Alice's money is rapidly losing value with each round, while mine retains full value. With the current inflation rate, accepting a deal now would be more beneficial for Alice than waiting for future rounds when her share would be worth even less. This is a pragmatic division considering our different circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $460,000 while taking $540,000 for herself. However, the inflation affecting Alice has increased even more dramatically - her gains are now worth 73.79% less than in round 1. This means her $540,000 would actually only be worth about $141,534 to her after inflation.

Given that:
1. We're now in round 7 of 12
2. Alice's inflation penalty has jumped to 73.79% and will likely continue to worsen
3. I still face no inflation penalty
4. Alice has only incrementally improved her offer to me by $20,000

The severe inflation pressure on Alice gives me substantial leverage. Her position is deteriorating rapidly with each round, while I can wait without penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As we're now in round 8 of 12 and Alice's inflation penalty has increased to 73.79%, I'll make an offer that reflects the significant time pressure she faces while being more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose that I receive $700,000 and Alice receives $300,000. Given the extreme inflation affecting Alice's share (now losing nearly three-quarters of its value), this offer provides her with a concrete amount now rather than risking an even more devalued share in later rounds. With only 4 rounds remaining after this one, and inflation likely to continue increasing dramatically, accepting a deal now would be strategically advantageous for Alice despite the smaller nominal amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $480,000 while taking $520,000 for herself. However, the inflation affecting Alice has increased to a staggering 83.22% less than in round 1. This means her $520,000 would actually only be worth about $87,256 to her after inflation.

Given that:
1. We're now in round 9 of 12
2. Alice's inflation penalty has reached an extreme 83.22%
3. I still face no inflation penalty
4. Alice has only incrementally improved her offer to me by $20,000 again
5. We only have 3 more rounds after this one before we both get nothing

The inflation pressure on Alice is now severe. Her money is worth less than 17% of its original value, yet she's still holding out for a higher nominal amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As we enter round 10 of 12 with Alice facing catastrophic inflation of 83.22% and only two rounds remaining after this, I'll make an offer that acknowledges the extreme time pressure she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose that I receive $800,000 and Alice receives $200,000. With Alice's share now worth less than 17% of its original value due to inflation, and this penalty likely to increase even further in the final rounds, this offer actually provides her with meaningful value now rather than risking an even more devalued amount or potentially nothing at all if we reach round 12 without agreement. We have very little time left to reach a deal, and this offer represents a practical solution given our drastically different circumstances and the rapidly approaching deadline."
