"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money 50-50, which seems fair to both of us. I'm facing 10% inflation with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than drag this out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice claims she faces 10% inflation while I face 5% inflation
2. A 50-50 split would give me $5,000
3. If I reject and propose next round, the money is worth 5% less to me
4. If I want to propose a better deal next round, I need to consider that:
   - My $5,000 now is better than $5,250 next round (due to 5% inflation)
   - Alice might reject if I'm too greedy

Given that:
- The offer is fair (50-50)
- Inflation will reduce the value of any future gains
- There's risk in negotiating further
- We both benefit from a quick agreement
