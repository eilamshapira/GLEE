"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. While she frames it as a ""fair"" split, 60-40 in her favor isn't exactly fair
3. I don't lose value to inflation, so I can afford to negotiate
4. Since it's the first round, I can make a counter-offer and aim for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being diplomatic:

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a truly fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away equally satisfied.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has increased my share slightly to $4200 (from her initial $4000)
2. She's experiencing inflation (9.75% loss), while I'm not affected
3. This means her $5800 is actually worth less to her now
4. Given that I'm immune to inflation, I can still negotiate for a better deal
5. We still have 9 rounds left, and my negotiating position gets stronger as inflation affects her more

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice is affected by inflation and I'm not, I can push for a slightly better deal while acknowledging her situation:

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given that inflation only affects you, this split actually gives you a fair value while accounting for time pressure. Let's conclude this deal now.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below this, considering the value I'm losing to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated situation:
1. Alice has increased my offer to $4400 (up from $4200)
2. Her inflation loss has increased to 18.55%
3. Her $5600 is worth significantly less to her now due to inflation
4. She seems to be showing a pattern of small increases in my share
5. Given that I'm immune to inflation and we still have 7 rounds left, I can continue negotiating
6. The increasing inflation strengthens my position further

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's inflation penalty is increasing significantly, I can push for an even better split while emphasizing the time pressure:

{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""With inflation at 18.55% and rising, you're losing value quickly. This split gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than a larger amount several rounds later. Let's conclude this before inflation erodes more value.""
