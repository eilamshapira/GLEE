"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. It's a fair start, considering I initiated the proposal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully before making my decision.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while she would take $600,000 (60%). While this is a substantial amount of money, the split isn't equal. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, which gives me some leverage.

Since there's no obvious time constraint or penalty for additional rounds mentioned in the rules, it makes sense to try to negotiate for a more balanced split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I believe an equal 50-50 split would be the most fair approach for both of us - each getting $500,000. This represents a standard fair division where neither of us is privileged over the other. Would you agree?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your suggestion for a 50-50 split, but I believe a slight adjustment to 55-45 in my favor is more reflective of the value I bring to the negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's counteroffer carefully.

Alice has reduced her requested share from 60% to 55%, which is a positive movement toward my proposed equal split. She's now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. 

While this isn't the 50-50 split I proposed, it represents a meaningful compromise on her part. If I reject, I could propose another split, but there's a risk of prolonged negotiation with diminishing returns. The current offer gives me a substantial amount of money, and the difference between this and my ideal outcome ($50,000) may not be worth the risk of continued negotiation.
