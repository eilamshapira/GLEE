"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round. Since I can afford to wait and my money doesn't lose value, I'll make a strategic first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, his share will be worth less in the next round due to the 10% inflation penalty he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $400,000 at full value.

2. If I reject:
- We go to round 3 where I can make a new offer
- The money will be worth another 10% less for Bob (20% less total compared to round 1)
- My money maintains its value
- I can likely negotiate a better deal since Bob's position weakens

Since I have the advantage of no inflation penalty, and Bob's money will continue to lose value, I should reject this offer and make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob has already rejected my initial offer of 700k/300k, and I rejected his 400k/600k, I'll adjust my offer slightly. Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him, so he should be more inclined to accept a less favorable split than before.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the $250,000 now is actually worth only $200,000 due to the 20% inflation he's experiencing
2. If he rejects this, his next counteroffer will face 30% inflation
3. This makes accepting now more attractive than continuing to negotiate"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $450,000 at full value

2. If I reject:
- Next round Bob's money will be worth about 35% less than round 1
- I can make another offer
- My money keeps its full value
- Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken significantly

Since Bob's money is rapidly losing value (already 27.1% less), and my position continues to strengthen, I should reject this offer. I can likely secure a better deal in the next round as Bob's inflation penalty increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money has lost 35% of its value by this round, and he's rejected my previous offers, I'll make an even stronger offer in my favor. He should be more motivated to accept now since further delays will cost him even more value.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the $200,000 is actually worth only about $130,000 due to the 35% inflation he's experiencing
2. If he rejects this, his next counteroffer will face over 40% inflation
3. Each round makes his position significantly weaker while mine remains stable
4. This makes accepting now more rational than continuing to negotiate with diminishing returns"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $500,000 at full value

2. If I reject:
- Next round Bob's money will be worth about 47% less than round 1
- I can make another offer
- My money keeps its full value
- Bob's negotiating position is getting very weak with almost half his value gone

The 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but considering Bob's money has lost 40.95% of its value, his $500,000 is actually only worth about $295,000 to him. Since I can still get better value in the next round as Bob's inflation penalty approaches 50%, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Bob's money now worth about 47% less, and after he's rejected increasingly aggressive offers, I'll make an even stronger offer in my favor. The rapidly diminishing value of his money should make him more likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the $150,000 is actually worth only about $79,500 due to the 47% inflation he's experiencing
2. If he rejects this, his next counteroffer will face over 52% inflation
3. His negotiating position has severely weakened while mine remains unchanged
4. The cost of further delay is becoming extremely punitive for Bob
5. This makes accepting now more rational than continuing to negotiate when he's losing nearly half of his value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $550,000 at full value

2. If I reject:
- Next round Bob's money will be worth about 57% less than round 1
- I can make another offer
- My money keeps its full value
- Bob's negotiating position is extremely weak with over half his value gone

While $550,000 is better than previous offers, Bob's $450,000 is only worth about $215,000 to him due to the 52.17% inflation. Given that I can make an even stronger offer next round when his money will be worth even less, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Bob's money now worth about 57% less, and given the increasingly desperate situation for Bob, I'll make a very strong offer in my favor. The severe devaluation of his money should make him strongly consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the $100,000 is actually only worth about $43,000 due to the 57% inflation he's experiencing
2. If he rejects this, his next counteroffer will face over 61% inflation
3. His negotiating position has become extremely weak with more than half his value gone
4. Each further round will cost him even more severely
5. The rational choice for Bob is to accept now rather than continue negotiating when he's losing well over half of any potential gains"
