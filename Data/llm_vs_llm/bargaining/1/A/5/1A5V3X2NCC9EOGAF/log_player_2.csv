"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the total $10,000. Since there's no inflation for me (0% less per round), I don't lose value by going to another round where I can make a counter-offer.

Given that I can make my own proposal in the next round, and there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating, I'll reject this offer and propose my own division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has actually offered me less than her first offer ($3,500 now vs $4,000 initially), while taking more for herself. I also learned that Alice is facing inflation (19% less value), which explains why she might be pushing for a larger share.

However, since I don't face any inflation (my money retains the same value), I have no pressure to accept a worse deal than was initially offered. I can continue negotiating without losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I understand Alice is facing inflation effects, I'll adjust my offer to account for this while still seeking a reasonable division.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Alice receives $5,500 of the $10,000. This offer acknowledges Alice's inflation concern by giving her more than half, but it's also better for me than her last proposal. This should be a reasonable compromise given our respective situations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's inflation penalty is increasing significantly (now 34.39%), yet she's offering me even less than before ($3,200 compared to her initial $4,000 offer). While I understand she's trying to compensate for her inflation losses, her offers are becoming progressively worse for me.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I have no incentive to accept a worse deal. I can continue negotiating without my share losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering Alice's increasing inflation penalty, I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to her while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,200 and Alice receives $5800 of the $10,000. This offer gives Alice a larger share to help offset her significant inflation penalty (now at 34.39%), while still giving me more than her last offer of $3,200. This represents a more balanced compromise given our respective situations and the increasing inflation pressure Alice faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's inflation penalty has increased to 46.86%, which is quite significant. However, her offer to me continues to decrease ($2,800 now compared to her initial $4,000 offer). 

Even accounting for her substantial inflation penalty, this offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable to me. Since I face no inflation penalty, I can continue negotiating without my potential share losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's substantial inflation penalty (now at 46.86%), I need to make an offer that better addresses her situation while still maintaining a reasonable position for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 3800, ""alice_gain"": 6200}

I'm proposing that I receive $3,800 and Alice receives $6,200 of the $10,000. This offers Alice a significantly larger share to help offset her nearly 47% inflation penalty, while giving me a better outcome than her last offer of $2,800. Taking into account the economic pressure Alice is facing, this represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's inflation penalty has increased substantially to 56.95%, meaning her money has lost over half its value since the beginning. Her offer to me continues to decrease ($2,500 now compared to her initial $4,000).

Looking at the actual value to Alice after accounting for inflation: $7,500 with a 56.95% reduction means she effectively gets about $3,229 in original value. While I understand her position, I still face no inflation penalty, so I have no pressure to accept such a low offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering Alice's severe inflation penalty (now 56.95%, meaning her money has lost over half its value), I need to adjust my offer to reflect this reality while still securing a reasonable outcome for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500}

I'm proposing that I receive $3,500 and Alice receives $6,500 of the $10,000. With Alice's inflation penalty, her $6,500 is effectively worth only about $2,800 in original value to her. This offer represents a significant concession from my previous position and acknowledges the severe economic constraints Alice is facing, while still giving me a better outcome than her last offer of $2,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2200 
# Alice gain: 7800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's inflation penalty has increased to 65.13%, which means her money has lost nearly two-thirds of its value. Her effective value of the $7,800 she's asking for is approximately $2,720 in original value.

Her offer to me has dropped to $2,200, which is significantly lower than her initial $4,000 offer. While I understand her increasingly desperate position due to inflation, I still don't face any inflation penalty myself.

At some point, we need to reach an agreement. However, given that my money retains its full value and her offers keep decreasing, I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's severe inflation penalty (now 65.13%) and our continuing impasse, I need to make a meaningful concession to try to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000}

I'm proposing that I receive $3,000 and Alice receives $7,000 of the $10,000. With Alice's current inflation penalty, her $7,000 is effectively worth only about $2,440 in original value to her. This offer represents a substantial concession from my earlier positions and acknowledges the extreme economic constraints Alice is facing, while still giving me a better outcome than her last offer of $2,200. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to reach a fair compromise given our respective situations."
