Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're being difficult, I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids further losses from inflation for both of us. Take it or leave it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
