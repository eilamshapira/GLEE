Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I take 5250 and you take 4750? This accounts for the inflation I'm experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives him more than half of the original amount, and considering the inflation affecting his gain, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor and he's experiencing inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need to account for the inflation, so I'd like to take 5500. You'd still get 4500, which is a fair amount considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer still gives him more than half of the original amount, and considering the significant inflation affecting his gain (14.26% less), I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was not in my favor, and he's experiencing significant inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes advantage of his decreasing valuation of the money.

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is really hurting your side, so let's be realistic about the split. 30% is generous considering the circumstances.""
