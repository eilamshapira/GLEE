"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 5000/5000 split, which appears fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be reduced by 20%. So if I were to get the entire 10,000 in round 2, it would only be worth 8,000 to me. This means that Alice's current offer of 5,000 is better than any counter-offer where I'd get less than 6,250 in the next round (since 6,250 * 0.8 = 5,000).

Since Alice is offering me a fair half of the pot with no delay penalties, this is actually a very reasonable offer given the inflation effect.
