"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, I'll make a proposal next round, but due to 20% inflation, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me. That means even if I get all $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $80 to me.

Since Alice is offering me $50 now, which is worth a full $50 to me, and the maximum I could effectively get next round would be $80 (if I somehow got the entire $100), rejecting doesn't make strategic sense.
