"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me. Since I'm facing a 10% inflation penalty per round, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and equitable, giving us each $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic here. The money is now worth 20% less to me due to inflation (10% per round), so I should adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. Given the inflation penalty I'm facing, this slightly higher amount for me helps offset my declining purchasing power while still offering Bob a substantial portion. This is a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges both our interests."
