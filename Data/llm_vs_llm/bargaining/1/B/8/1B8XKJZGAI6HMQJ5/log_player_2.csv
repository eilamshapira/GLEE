"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. As Bob, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round. While I need to be mindful of the 20% depreciation per round, 10$ is too low of an offer, especially in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that I'm facing value depreciation in future rounds. If Alice rejects this, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth 40% less to me, so I'm incentivized to make a fair offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because 20$ with a 36% reduction is too low. Even though the value is decreasing for me each round, the offer is still not fair enough to accept. With the 36% reduction, I would only effectively get $12.80 (20 * 0.64). I'll take my chances with making another proposal next round, even though I'll face a 48% reduction then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share slightly to 65-35 because I need to account for the significant depreciation I'm facing. At this point, this 65$ would be worth only 33.8$ to me due to the 48% reduction (65 * 0.52). This is still a reasonable offer for Alice as she gets 35$ at full value. If she rejects this, we'll both risk further losses as the rounds continue, and my next opportunity will face even more depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it might seem low at first glance, let's analyze the situation:

1. With the 59.04% reduction, my $30 would be worth effectively $12.29 (30 * 0.4096)
2. If I reject, my next offer would face a 71.23% reduction
3. We've already gone through 5 rounds, and we only have 7 rounds left
4. Alice has shown she's willing to reject offers where she gets less than 70$
5. The depreciation is making my position worse each round

Given these factors, especially the severe depreciation and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk further losses through continued negotiation."
