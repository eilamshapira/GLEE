"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, which means the $100 total would effectively be worth only $80 from my perspective. 

In that next round, I could make a counter-offer, but I need to weigh the risk of further inflation against getting a better deal now.

Given that $40 now is better than potentially less later due to the inflation effect, and considering that Alice's 60-40 split isn't extremely unfair, I'll accept.
