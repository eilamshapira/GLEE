900000.0,100000.0,Let's be fair. I get 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Since money loses 10% value for you each round, this is actually a fair offer. Your $400000 now is worth more than getting $900000 several rounds later. Let's make a deal and both walk away with good value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I think we both can do better than this. I'm willing to offer you 40% of the pot, as long as you accept now and don't make us go through more rounds. This is a fair offer given the inflation penalty",Alice,3,
