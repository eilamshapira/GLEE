"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since money loses 10% value for you each round, this is actually a fair offer. Your $400000 now is worth more than getting $900000 several rounds later. Let's make a deal and both walk away with good value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
