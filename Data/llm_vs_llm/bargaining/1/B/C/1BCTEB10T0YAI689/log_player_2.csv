"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I get 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 while taking $900,000 for herself. This is far from a fair split, especially considering that:
1. Money doesn't lose value for me between rounds
2. Money loses 10% value for Alice each round
3. I can make the next offer if I reject

If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, where Alice's maximum potential gain will already be reduced by 10%. This gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's 10% value loss per round.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since money loses 10% value for you each round, this is actually a fair offer. Your $400,000 now is worth more than getting $900,000 several rounds later. Let's make a deal and both walk away with good value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we both can do better than this. I'm willing to offer you 40% of the pot, as long as you accept now and don't make us go through more rounds. This is a fair offer given the inflation penalty 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) and keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. For Alice, her $600,000 is already worth 19% less due to inflation
3. My $400,000 maintains its full value
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and each round reduces Alice's value by another 10%
5. However, this is a significant improvement from her first offer of just 10%

While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk of deadlock leading to both of us getting nothing. $400,000 is a substantial amount, and given that Alice's share is already devalued, this is becoming a more reasonable split.
