"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in round 2 the money will be worth less to me
4. $4,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less in the next round

While 40% isn't the most favorable split, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,000 in the next round to overcome the 5% loss in value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances making a counter-offer in the next round, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal even accounting for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering that I'm already facing 5% inflation on my share.

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split of 52/48. This is fairer than the previous offer, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}

I'm offering a split that's closer to 50/50 but slightly in my favor to compensate for the inflation I've already incurred. This should be more appealing to Alice than her initial 60/40 split, while still being reasonable enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll meet you in the middle. How about 55/45? Remember inflation is hurting us both! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 (45%)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, this $4,500 is actually worth about $4,061
3. I know Alice is experiencing 36% inflation, which explains why she's more willing to compromise
4. If I reject, my inflation penalty will increase further in the next round
5. Her current offer is better than her initial offer (45% vs 40%)
6. Given the significant inflation Alice is facing, she might be more desperate to close the deal

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
- The real value I'm getting ($4,061) is still reasonable
- Further rounds would decrease the money's value even more for both of us
- We've reached a more balanced split than the initial offer
- The risk of continuing negotiation outweighs the potential benefits"
