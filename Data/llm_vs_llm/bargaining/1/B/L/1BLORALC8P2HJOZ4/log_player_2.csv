"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $2,000 out of the $10,000. This is only 20% of the total amount, which is quite low. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. I could then propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that this is a relatively unfavorable first offer, I'll reject it and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a reasonable division that gives us both a substantial portion of the money. I'm asking for a bit more than half since I'm facing a known 5% inflation with each round, and we should try to conclude this negotiation efficiently."
