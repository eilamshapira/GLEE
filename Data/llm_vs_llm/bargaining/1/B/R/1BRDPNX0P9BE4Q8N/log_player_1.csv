"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces steeper inflation (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair first offer because although I'm taking more, Bob gets a substantial portion and avoids the heavy inflation penalty he would face in later rounds."
