"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice proposes I get $40 and she gets $60 out of the $100.

If I reject, we go to round 2, where I'll make the offer. However, inflation means the $100 will be worth 20% less to me (meaning the $100 is effectively worth $80 to me in round 2). For Alice, the inflation is only 5%, so the $100 would be worth $95 to her in round 2.

Given this significant inflation difference that disadvantages me more than Alice, getting $40 now might be better than rejecting and facing greater inflation in later rounds. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth, especially to me.
