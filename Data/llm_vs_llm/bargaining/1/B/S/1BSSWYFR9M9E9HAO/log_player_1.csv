Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 900000,""bob_gain"": 100000,""message"": ""I think a fair split considering inflation is for me to take $900,000 and you get $100,000. Let's finalize this and avoid any losses!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 550000, and you get 450000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we don't risk losing more money with further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
