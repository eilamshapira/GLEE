900000.0,100000.0,"Alice, delaying further means more value lost to inflation. In round 3 you could claim nearly the entire pie, but it would only be worth about $810000 in real terms. To avoid further devaluation, I propose we split the available $1000000—with me receiving $100000 and you $900000—so you get essentially what you’d ensure by waiting. Let's settle now and preserve our gains.",Bob,2,
