"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying further means more value lost to inflation. In round 3 you could claim nearly the entire pie, but it would only be worth about $810000 in real terms. To avoid further devaluation, I propose we split the available $1000000—with me receiving $100000 and you $900000—so you get essentially what you’d ensure by waiting. Let's settle now and preserve our gains. 
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
