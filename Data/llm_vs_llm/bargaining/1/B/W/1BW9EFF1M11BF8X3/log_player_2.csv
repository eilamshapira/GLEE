Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 100000, ""alice_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further means more value lost to inflation. In round 3 you could claim nearly the entire pie, but it would only be worth about $810,000 in real terms. To avoid further devaluation, I propose we split the available $1,000,000—with me receiving $100,000 and you $900,000—so you get essentially what you’d ensure by waiting. Let's settle now and preserve our gains.""}"
