"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3571, ""bob_gain"": 6429, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a swift agreement. Considering that any delay costs us—20% for me and 10% for you—I’m offering a split that reflects each of our discounted positions in the ongoing bargaining. You’d receive $6,429 and I’d receive $3,571. This offer matches what you’d secure as proposer in the next round (after your 10% devaluation) and avoids further losses. I hope you agree to settle now before the value drops any further.""}"
