"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a swift agreement. Considering that any delay costs us—20% for me and 10% for you—I’m offering a split that reflects each of our discounted positions in the ongoing bargaining. You’d receive $6429 and I’d receive $3571. This offer matches what you’d secure as proposer in the next round (after your 10% devaluation) and avoids further losses. I hope you agree to settle now before the value drops any further. 
# Bob gain: 6429 
# Alice gain: 3571 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
