"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly—$50 each. Given that the longer we delay the less the money is worth (at least for me), it’s in both our interests to settle quickly. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
