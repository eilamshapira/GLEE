Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""How about a fair start? I propose we split it 60-40.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you wait for the next round, your share will be discounted at 10% and you'll end up with roughly the same effective value—but less money in nominal terms. By accepting now, you secure 3100, which is optimal given the future inflation. Let’s agree and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
