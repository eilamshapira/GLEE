"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: if you wait for the next round, your share will be discounted at 10% and you'll end up with roughly the same effective value—but less money in nominal terms. By accepting now, you secure 3100, which is optimal given the future inflation. Let’s agree and avoid further loss.""}"
