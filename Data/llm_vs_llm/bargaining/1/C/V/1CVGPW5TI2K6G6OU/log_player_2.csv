"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet. Alice's offer gives me $45, which is slightly less than a 50-50 split.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $45 would only be worth $36 in real value. Further rounds would reduce the value even more.

Given that the offer is relatively fair (only 5% less than an even split) and the inflation penalty for waiting is significant, I should accept this offer.
