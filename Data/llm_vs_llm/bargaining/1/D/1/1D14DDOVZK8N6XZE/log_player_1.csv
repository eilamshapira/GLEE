"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my offer for dividing the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a fair division considering the inflation risk I face in future rounds. If we move to another round, the total value decreases for me by 10%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
