"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4000 and she gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, $4000 would become worth $3600 to me next round

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $4000 now is better than risking further negotiations where my purchasing power decreases. The inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive.
