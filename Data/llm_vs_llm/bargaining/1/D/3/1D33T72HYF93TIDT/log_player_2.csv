"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done! I'm offering you a solid starting point. Take it or risk getting less later.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm adjusting my offer, but I'm still keeping a good chunk. This is a good compromise, consider taking it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, and while the inflation is hurting, I'm hoping to negotiate a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at this deal. I'm offering a reasonable compromise. Let's close this out.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, this is it. I'm making a final, fair offer. Don't let this slip away. We both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is not ideal with the inflation considered, but getting into later rounds is too risky.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better."
