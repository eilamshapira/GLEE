"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds. I want to encourage acceptance early.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I would get $47, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $42.3 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less due to further inflation
- Bob's offer is not too far from a 50-50 split
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the value keeps decreasing

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
