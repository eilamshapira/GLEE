While a 50/50 split seems fair, I'm willing to bet Alice values the money decreasing less than I do.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but with inflation, getting $45 now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
