"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4000 while she gets $6000 out of the $10,000. 

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less for me with each round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round.

I think I can propose a more favorable split for myself, so I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while providing clear reasoning.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives each of us $5,000. This is a fair division that treats us both equally. Since there's no inflation impact for either of us (at least from my perspective), this even split seems most equitable and reasonable."
