"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split. This seems fair as we both contribute equally to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation information and Bob's prior offer, I'll adjust my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose a 45-55 split. Since inflation is affecting both of us but at different rates, this seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face."
