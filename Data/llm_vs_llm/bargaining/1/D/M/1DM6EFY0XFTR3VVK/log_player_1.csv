"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the need to secure a deal early to avoid losses from inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My proposal is that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This gives me a slight advantage, but hopefully is generous enough for Bob to accept and avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
