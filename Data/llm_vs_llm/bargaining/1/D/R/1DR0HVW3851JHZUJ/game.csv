50.0,50.0,I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. We both walk away with equal amounts.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair. This way, we both still get a reasonable amount, but I get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,I understand your concern about inflation. Let's compromise - I'll take 45 and you get 55. This is a fair middle ground considering we both want to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential value loss.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
