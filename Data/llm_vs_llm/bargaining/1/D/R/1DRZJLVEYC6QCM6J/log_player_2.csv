"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * $400,000 now > $450,000 in next round (after 10% inflation)

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation. If I reject, even if I propose a better split next round, my purchasing power will be reduced by 10%.
