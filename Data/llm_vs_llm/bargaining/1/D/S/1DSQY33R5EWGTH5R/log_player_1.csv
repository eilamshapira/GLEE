"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a simple backward‐induction reasoning (using the idea that when one player is proposing they must give the other just what they’d expect to secure in their own upcoming proposal, but now taking into account that each round “devalues” the money by 5% for you and 10% for Bob), a reasonable equilibrium offer in round 1 is approximately as follows:

• When it’s your (Alice’s) turn you’d want to keep about US$6,900 and give Bob around US$3,100.  
• In fact, if we let Vₐ be the dollar‐amount (in round‑proposal terms) that Alice obtains when she makes her offer and Vᵦ when Bob makes his offer, then requiring that Bob gets exactly just his “waiting value” in round 1 (namely, δ_B × Vᵦ, with δ_B = 0.90) and similarly that in Bob’s proposal he must offer Alice δ_A × Vₐ with δ_A = 0.95, we obtain the equations

  Vₐ = 10,000 − 0.90·Vᵦ  
  Vᵦ = 10,000 − 0.95·Vₐ.

Solving these gives Vₐ ≈ 6,897 and Vᵦ ≈ 3,448 (in nominal round‑proposal dollars).  
Thus, when Alice makes her offer in round 1 she would give Bob 0.90·Vᵦ ≈ 3,103 dollars so that the entire pie sums to 10,000 dollars.

Here is the JSON message for our offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using backward‐induction reasoning, we first “look ahead” to what would happen if Bob were to reject our offer in round 3. In round 3 the money is “discounted” by 10% for me (Alice) and by 20% for Bob relative to round 1 (that is, my money is worth 90% of its nominal value and Bob’s 80%). If Bob rejects, he becomes the proposer in round 4. In round 4 the discounts are even steeper: my winnings will be worth 85% of their nominal value (since in round 4 I suffer 15% inflation) and Bob’s will be worth 70% (a 30% drop).  
 
Assuming both parties are perfectly rational, in round 4 an alternating‐offer analysis (analogous to the classic Rubinstein solution when players have different discount factors) tells us that Bob, as proposer, can secure a nominal amount of about 3,704 dollars for himself (and offer me approximately 6,296 dollars). However, because of the round‐4 inflation these nominal amounts are “realized” as 70%·3,704 ≈ 2,592.8 for Bob and 85%·6,296 ≈ 5,351.6 for me.  
 
Now, turning back to round 3 (where I—Alice—am proposing), if Bob rejects my offer he can expect to get an actual (inflation‐adjusted) value of about 2,593 dollars in round 4. In round 3 Bob’s money is discounted at 80% (so his actual value is 0.80 times his nominal dollars if he were to accept a round‑3 offer). Thus, to make Bob just indifferent he must receive a nominal amount x satisfying:  
  0.80 · x ≈ 2,593  ⟹  x ≈ 2,593/0.80 ≈ 3,241.  
 
That is, if I offer Bob a nominal 3,241 dollars in round 3, he gets about 0.80×3,241 ≈ 2,593 in real value—exactly what he’d get by rejecting and waiting until round 4. Since the total nominal amount is 10,000 dollars, I would then keep 10,000 − 3,241 = 6,759 dollars nominally. My round‑3 realized value would be 0.90×6,759 ≈ 6,083 dollars, which is indeed better than waiting (since if I were to reject Bob’s round‑2 offer I would face round‑4 as a responder and get about 5,352 in real value).  
 
Thus, an equilibrium offer for round 3 is to propose nominal splits:  
  Alice: 6,759 dollars  
  Bob: 3,241 dollars  
 
Expressed in JSON, the round‑3 proposal is as follows:
{""alice_gain"": 6759, ""bob_gain"": 3241}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using the standard backwards‑induction approach under Rubinstein’s alternating‑offers framework (with discounting applied multiplicatively by round), we first note that the parties’ “real‐value” factors (relative to round‑1 dollars) are now as follows:

• In round 5 (our proposal): 
 – Alice’s discount factor: δ_A5 = 0.95⁴ ≈ 0.81451 
 – Bob’s discount factor: δ_B5 = 0.9⁴ ≈ 0.6561

• In round 6 (if Bob rejects and then becomes proposer): 
 – Alice’s discount factor: δ_A6 = 0.95⁵ ≈ 0.77378 
 – Bob’s discount factor: δ_B6 = 0.9⁵ ≈ 0.59049

Now, according to the classic Rubinstein solution when the proposer “extracts” surplus and leaves the responder just his continuation value, if the game were infinite (or if we “freeze” the remaining rounds with these discount factors) the equilibrium (nominal) split when a player is the proposer is given by

  Proposer’s share = (1 – (responder’s discount factor))/(1 – (δ_A · δ_B)) · 10,000

However, our calculations in earlier rounds illustrated the idea that the proposer must offer the responder an amount that, when discounted at his current factor, equals the value he expects to get when he “flips” the roles next round.

Let x be Bob’s nominal amount in our round‑5 proposal. Then his realized (round‑5) value is
  Realized value if he accepts = 0.6561 · x

If he rejects our offer, he will become proposer in round 6. Then, using Rubinstein’s insight with the round‑6 discount factors, his equilibrium nominal payoff as proposer would be

  Bob’s round‑6 nominal share = (1 – δ_A6)/(1 – δ_A6·δ_B6) · 10,000

Plugging in the numbers:
  1 – δ_A6 = 1 – 0.77378 = 0.22622
  δ_A6·δ_B6 ≈ 0.77378 × 0.59049 ≈ 0.456 (approximately)
  Thus, 1 – (δ_A6·δ_B6) ≈ 0.544

So Bob’s round‑6 nominal share is about
  0.22622/0.544 × 10,000 ≈ 4,157

But in round 6 Bob’s money is “worth” only 0.59049 per nominal dollar, so his realized value would be approximately

  4,157 × 0.59049 ≈ 2,453

For Bob to be indifferent in round 5 between accepting our offer and waiting to propose in round 6, we must choose x so that

  0.6561 · x ≈ 2,453

Solving for x:
  x ≈ 2,453 / 0.6561 ≈ 3,739

That is, if we offer Bob a nominal 3,739 dollars in round 5, he will get about 2,453 in real (inflation‐adjusted) value – exactly what he expects by waiting until round 6.

Since the total “pie” is 10,000 nominal dollars, we keep

  10,000 – 3,739 = 6,261 nominal dollars for ourselves in round 5.

Thus, our round‑5 offer (in nominal dollars) is:

  Alice: 6,261  
  Bob: 3,739

Expressed in JSON, we send our proposal as follows:
