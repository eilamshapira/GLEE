"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject this offer:
1. I can make a counter-offer next round
2. While the money will be worth 5% less for me, it will be worth 10% less for Alice
3. This gives me some leverage to negotiate a better deal since Alice has more to lose from delay

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a division that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being acceptable to Alice.

Given that Alice faces 10% depreciation per round compared to my 5%, she has more incentive to accept a slightly less favorable offer now rather than wait. However, I shouldn't be too greedy as she might still reject if the offer is too unfair.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a better share while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it, considering her higher depreciation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from 50-50 to 55-45 in my favor
2. If I reject this offer:
   * The money will be worth 14.75% less for me in the next round
   * The money will be worth 29% less for Alice in the next round
   * I can make another counter-offer

However, this is actually a good offer considering:
1. It's better than her initial offer
2. The money is already worth 9.75% less for me now
3. If I reject, any gains from a better split might be offset by the continuing inflation
4. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by offering me more

I think it's wise to accept this offer now rather than risk further depreciation.
