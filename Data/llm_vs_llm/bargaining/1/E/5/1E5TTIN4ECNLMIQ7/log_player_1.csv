"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant sum, but I need to be fairly compensated for the risk I'm taking with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
