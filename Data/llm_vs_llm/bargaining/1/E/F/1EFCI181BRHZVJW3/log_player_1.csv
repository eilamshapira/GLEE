"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that the money loses 20% value for me each round, I should aim for a favorable initial split, but not so extreme that Bob will certainly reject it.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. My reasoning is that if Bob rejects this, and we go to the next round, the total value will only be worth 800,000 to me due to inflation, making it harder to reach a satisfactory outcome. This offer gives Bob a significant portion while still maintaining an advantage for me."
