"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose we go for a 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and it's a fair starting point considering the opportunity to make your own proposal next round if you want.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 10% decrease in value each round, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair adjustment given the urgency to settle before the money loses more value. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
