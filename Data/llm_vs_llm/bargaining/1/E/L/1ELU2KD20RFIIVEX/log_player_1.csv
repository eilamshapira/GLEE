Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob. I want to factor in the inflation that affects me but not Bob. I'll make an offer that is beneficial to Bob to increase the likelihood of acceptance, considering it's the first round.
