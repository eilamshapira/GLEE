"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $550,000 (55%) and keeping $450,000 (45%) for herself. The key factor to consider is that there's asymmetric inflation in this game - while the money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds, Alice faces 20% depreciation per round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice will be motivated to accept a reasonable offer since her share would be worth 20% less to her if she rejects. This gives me negotiating leverage.

However, the current offer already gives me the majority of the money (55%), which is quite fair. Given that I'm already getting more than half, and there's always some risk in negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
