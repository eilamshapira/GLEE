5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a 50-50 split which is $5000 each. This is completely fair and accounts for our different depreciation rates - if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value but I lose more because of my higher depreciation rate. Let's agree to this even split now and both walk away satisfied.",Bob,2,
