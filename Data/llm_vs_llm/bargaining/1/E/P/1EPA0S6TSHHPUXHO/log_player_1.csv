"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair proposal. I propose $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you, considering our different depreciation rates. Does that sound good to you?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a 50-50 split which is $5000 each. This is completely fair and accounts for our different depreciation rates - if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value but I lose more because of my higher depreciation rate. Let's agree to this even split now and both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
