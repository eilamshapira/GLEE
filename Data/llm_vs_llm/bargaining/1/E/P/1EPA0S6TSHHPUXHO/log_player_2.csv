"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair proposal. I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you, considering our different depreciation rates. Does that sound good to you? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4000 while she gets $6000. Given the different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for Alice per round), I should consider whether I could get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer next round.

If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but my $4000 would be worth 20% less (only $3200 in current value), while Alice's $6000 would be worth 5% less (about $5700 in current value).

Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me, I'll reject this initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a counter-offer that considers our different inflation rates while being attractive enough for Alice to accept. Since money depreciates faster for me (20% per round) than for Alice (5% per round), I should factor this into my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a 50-50 split which is $5000 each. This is completely fair and accounts for our different depreciation rates - if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value but I lose more because of my higher depreciation rate. Let's agree to this even split now and both walk away satisfied.""}"
