"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

At first glance, a 50-50 split might seem fair. However, I need to consider that:
1. Any delay will cost me 10% per round due to inflation
2. Alice doesn't suffer from inflation
3. I have the advantage of making the next offer if I reject

If I reject, in the next round:
- The $500,000 would be worth $450,000 to me (10% less)
- But I could propose a better split in my favor

Since I have the power to make the next offer and Alice isn't affected by inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a more favorable split next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I should propose a split that:
1. Takes into account my inflation disadvantage
2. Is still attractive enough for Alice to accept
3. Compensates me for the 10% loss I've already taken

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This split is justified because:
1. It helps offset my inflation disadvantage
2. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it
3. If Alice rejects, we both risk further losses in future rounds
4. The absolute amount for Alice ($400,000) is still substantial"
