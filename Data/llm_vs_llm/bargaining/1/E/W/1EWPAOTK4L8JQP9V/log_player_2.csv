"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round and mine doesn't, I can negotiate for a better deal. Her offer of only 100,000$ for me is too low considering she has more pressure to conclude the deal quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split considering that Alice's money will be worth 10% less next round if she rejects (so her $400,000 now is better than potentially more money later). This is a fair offer that acknowledges both our positions while taking into account the time pressure on Alice's side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Alice is under increasing pressure from inflation (her money will be worth 27.1% less next round), while my purchasing power remains unchanged. She's moved significantly from her first offer, showing she understands her position. I can likely get a better deal in the next round since she's losing value faster than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm increasing my requested share because Alice's money continues to devalue (will be worth 27.1% less to her at this point), while mine maintains its value. The $300,000 I'm offering Alice is still worth more to her now than a potentially larger sum in future rounds due to the continuing 10% inflation penalty she faces. This offer reflects the growing urgency for Alice to reach an agreement."
