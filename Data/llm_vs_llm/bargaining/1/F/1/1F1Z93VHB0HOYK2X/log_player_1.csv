"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle things quickly. I propose $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for you. Accepting now ensures we both get a fair and immediate deal before the inflation takes away any value for me. Letâ€™s make this work!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you a bit less, but this is still a good deal, especially considering inflation. Accept this, and we'll both get a decent amount.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I accept your offer. Even though the inflation cuts my share's value, it's best to secure the deal now rather than risk further losses in coming rounds.""}"
