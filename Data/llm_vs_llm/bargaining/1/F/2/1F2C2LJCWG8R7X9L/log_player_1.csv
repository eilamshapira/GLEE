**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. While his offer is close to a 50/50 split of the nominal amount, the real value of my share is decreasing rapidly. I need to push for a better deal while there's still time, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
