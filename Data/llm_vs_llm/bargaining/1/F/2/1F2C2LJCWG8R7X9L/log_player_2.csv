Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a substantial amount, but the inflation is working against us.  This is a more balanced split considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to hold firm for a better offer. Accepting now would mean losing too much to inflation."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. The inflation is eating away at the value, and this is the most balanced I can go while ensuring we both get a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is less than ideal, but given the advanced round and the relentless inflation, it's the best I'm likely to get. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
