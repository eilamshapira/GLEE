"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 40/60 split, which means I'd get $40 and Alice would get $60
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

The current offer gives me $40. If I reject, my next round's dollars will only be worth 90% of current value, so I'd need to secure more than $44.44 ($40/0.9) in the next round to make rejection worthwhile.

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the risk of further devaluation and potential continued rejection makes this a reasonably fair offer, considering Alice made the first move.
