Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one. I'm losing a lot to inflation, but I still believe I have leverage. Alice seems very eager to close the deal.  Let's see if I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, This is the last time I'm doing the offer. If you reject, we're both getting nothing. So, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a difficult decision, as I'm losing a significant amount to inflation. However, Alice seems adamant about not budging further, and I risk getting nothing if I reject. It's better to take something than nothing at this point."
