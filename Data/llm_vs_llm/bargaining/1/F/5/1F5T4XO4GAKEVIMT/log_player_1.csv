"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. This accounts for the time I've spent considering the deal and inflation concerns. Let's agree now to make the most out of it! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me, especially considering my money loses value faster than Bob's (10% vs 5% per round). I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my money is devaluing faster than yours (10% vs 5% per round). This 55-45 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""}"
