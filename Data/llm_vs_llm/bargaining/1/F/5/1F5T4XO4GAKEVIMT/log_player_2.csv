"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to agree early to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. This accounts for the time I've spent considering the deal and inflation concerns. Let's agree now to make the most out of it!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my money is devaluing faster than yours (10% vs 5% per round). This 55-45 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
