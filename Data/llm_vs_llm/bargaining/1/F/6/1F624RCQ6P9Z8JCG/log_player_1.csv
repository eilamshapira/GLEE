"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a relatively fair split, acknowledging that if Bob rejects it, I'll lose value due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split, offering myself a modest advantage while still giving Bob a substantial portion. My reasoning is that Bob might accept this rather than risk a back-and-forth negotiation where both of us lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My original offer was for $550,000
2. With 5% inflation, if I accept now, $475,000 is actually worth $451,250 to me
3. If I reject and we go to another round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
4. Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, not too far from a 50-50 split
5. The risk of losing more value to inflation outweighs the potential gain from another round
