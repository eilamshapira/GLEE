"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $50.

However, I need to keep in mind that if I reject and we move to the next round, inflation will reduce the money's value by 10% for me. This means the total would effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the best I could theoretically get is $90 (which would be worth $90 to me due to inflation), and Alice would get $0. But that's an extreme offer that Alice would likely reject.

A 50-50 split is generally fair, and delaying means I'm guaranteed to lose value due to inflation. Even if I managed to get a better percentage in the next round, I'd be dividing a pie that's worth less to me.
