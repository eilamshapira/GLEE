"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $400,000 now > $380,000 next round (5% less)
   * Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

2. Current offer assessment:
   * I get $400,000 (40% of total)
   * While not perfectly equal, it's a substantial amount
   * Getting it now avoids inflation risk
   * There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal after inflation

3. Game theory:
   * First offers in negotiation games are often slightly unfair
   * Risk of losing more value through inflation outweighs potential gains
   * Alice might be more aggressive in later rounds

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk, I'll accept this offer. While not perfectly equal, $400,000 now is better than risking less in future rounds.
