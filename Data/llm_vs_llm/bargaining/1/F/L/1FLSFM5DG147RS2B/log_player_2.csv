"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning my $50 share would effectively be worth only $40.

Even if I try to ask for more in the next round, the inflation penalty means I'd need to get significantly more just to break even with the current offer.

This seems like a fair initial offer, and given the inflation penalty, accepting now is better than risking a lower effective value in subsequent rounds.
