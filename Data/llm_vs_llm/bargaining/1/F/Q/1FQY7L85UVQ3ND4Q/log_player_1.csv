"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and myself.

Since there's a 5% inflation penalty for me in each round, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than a 50-50 split, if I reject this offer and we go to another round, I'll face an additional 5% inflation penalty. The current offer gives me $4,800, which is better than making a counter-offer that might be rejected, resulting in even less value for me due to increasing inflation penalties."
