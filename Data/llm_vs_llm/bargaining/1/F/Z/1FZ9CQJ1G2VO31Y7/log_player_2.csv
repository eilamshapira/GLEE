"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer from Alice:

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40% of the total) while she takes $600,000 (60%).

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the total money will effectively be worth $900,000 to me. However, I'll get to make the next proposal, which gives me some control.

While 40% isn't equal, it's still a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, I should consider accepting this reasonable first offer rather than risking greater losses.
