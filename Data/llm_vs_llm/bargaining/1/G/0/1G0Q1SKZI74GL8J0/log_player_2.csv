"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I would get $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. Even if I propose a better split next round, Alice might reject it
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting $47.5 (50% of $95) in the next round if Alice accepts
5. The offer is not great but reasonable enough considering the inflation risk
