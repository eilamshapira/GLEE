"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to be strategic here. While 500,000$ is a fair split at face value, I need to consider that with each round, my money loses 20% value due to inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and my potential gain would already be worth less.
