"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000. That's 40% of the total amount.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So my $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 if we delay one round.

Even if I could negotiate a better percentage in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $400,000 just to break even after inflation. Plus, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer.

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I think it's best to accept now.
