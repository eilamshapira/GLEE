Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Counteroffer, meeting you halfway from my initial proposal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain, even considering the inflation."
