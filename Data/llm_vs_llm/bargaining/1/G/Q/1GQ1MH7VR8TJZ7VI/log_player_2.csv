"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you lose more value per round (20% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept this reasonable offer now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60
2. If I reject, the next round I can make an offer, but:
   - My money will be worth 20% less (so $40 would become worth $32)
   - Her money will only depreciate 5%
3. She's right that I have a worse negotiating position due to higher inflation
4. However, 60-40 split in her favor seems a bit unfair given I'm the one under more time pressure

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even with the 20% depreciation, I might be able to negotiate a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering our different inflation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, while you're right about the inflation difference, a 50-50 split is more fair. Even with my higher inflation rate, this gives us both a good outcome. Let's not drag this out and risk both losing value.""}"
