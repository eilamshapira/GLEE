"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, as it's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while maximizing my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $40.5 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
- My best case scenario in the next round would be getting $60 (worth $48 after 20% inflation), but Bob would likely reject that
- The longer this goes on, the worse my position gets due to inflation

Given these factors, I should accept this offer as it's reasonable and inflation will hurt me more if I continue negotiating.
