600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation risk I face.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round, this is actually better for you than continuing to negotiate. If we go another round, your $500000 would effectively be worth only $400000 to you due to inflation. This is a win-win solution where we both walk away with equal shares.",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate the fair split, but considering the inflation, I'd prefer a 600000 for you and 400000 for me. If I accept 500000 now, it's effectively only worth 400000 to me, so let's adjust for that.",Alice,2,reject
576000.0,424000.0,"I've adjusted my offer to account for the inflation I'm facing. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider your inflation situation - you're now facing nearly 50% inflation, which means if we go another round, your money will be worth even less. This $450000 now is worth more to you than potentially getting $500000 or more in the next round after additional inflation. This is a reasonable compromise given our different inflation rates.",Bob,4,
