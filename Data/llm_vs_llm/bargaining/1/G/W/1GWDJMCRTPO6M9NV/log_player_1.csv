Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round, this is actually better for you than continuing to negotiate. If we go another round, your $500000 would effectively be worth only $400000 to you due to inflation. This is a win-win solution where we both walk away with equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the fair split, but considering the inflation, I'd prefer a 600000 for you and 400000 for me. If I accept 500000 now, it's effectively only worth 400000 to me, so let's adjust for that.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider your inflation situation - you're now facing nearly 50% inflation, which means if we go another round, your money will be worth even less. This $450000 now is worth more to you than potentially getting $500000 or more in the next round after additional inflation. This is a reasonable compromise given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
