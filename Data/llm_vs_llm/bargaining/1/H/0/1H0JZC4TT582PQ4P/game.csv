600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and divide it reasonably. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
805000.0,195000.0,"Alice, every round we delay reduces the overall pot by 20%. If you reject now, you’ll become proposer in round 3—but the money then will be worth only 64% of today’s value, giving you roughly $640000 in present terms. This offer gives you about $644000 in current value while I get $195000. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better outcome for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
660000.0,340000.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. This offer is more balanced and ensures we both get a fair share.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while your offer of 340000 nominal dollars (about 217600 in current value) appears fair on its face, I believe that by passing this round I can steer the negotiation in a way that secures a better outcome for me in round 4. Given that I’ll have the proposal advantage next round (even though further devaluation applies), it’s in my interest to reject this offer and work toward a more favorable division. Let’s continue negotiating.",Bob,3,reject
801000.0,199000.0,"Alice, by rejecting this offer you’d become the proposer in round 5, but the pot’s real value would drop to only about 41% of its original worth—roughly $409600 in your hands if you claimed nearly all of it. My offer, however, guarantees you a nominal $801000, which at the current multiplier (0.512) gives you approximately $410112 in real terms—better than your fallback. Let’s avoid further devaluation and settle now.",Bob,4,
