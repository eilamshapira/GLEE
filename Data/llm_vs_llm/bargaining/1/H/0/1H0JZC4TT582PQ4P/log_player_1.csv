Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay reduces the overall pot by 20%. If you reject now, you’ll become proposer in round 3—but the money then will be worth only 64% of today’s value, giving you roughly $640000 in present terms. This offer gives you about $644000 in current value while I get $195000. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 805000 
# Bob gain: 195000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting this offer you’d become the proposer in round 5, but the pot’s real value would drop to only about 41% of its original worth—roughly $409600 in your hands if you claimed nearly all of it. My offer, however, guarantees you a nominal $801000, which at the current multiplier (0.512) gives you approximately $410112 in real terms—better than your fallback. Let’s avoid further devaluation and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 801000 
# Bob gain: 199000
