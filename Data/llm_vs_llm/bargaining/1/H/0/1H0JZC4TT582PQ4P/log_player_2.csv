"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it reasonably. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 195000, ""alice_gain"": 805000, ""message"": ""Alice, every round we delay reduces the overall pot by 20%. If you reject now, you’ll become proposer in round 3—but the money then will be worth only 64% of today’s value, giving you roughly $640,000 in present terms. This offer gives you about $644,000 in current value while I get $195,000. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better outcome for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. This offer is more balanced and ensures we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 340000 
# Alice gain: 660000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer of 340,000 nominal dollars (about 217,600 in current value) appears fair on its face, I believe that by passing this round I can steer the negotiation in a way that secures a better outcome for me in round 4. Given that I’ll have the proposal advantage next round (even though further devaluation applies), it’s in my interest to reject this offer and work toward a more favorable division. Let’s continue negotiating.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 199000, ""alice_gain"": 801000, ""message"": ""Alice, by rejecting this offer you’d become the proposer in round 5, but the pot’s real value would drop to only about 41% of its original worth—roughly $409,600 in your hands if you claimed nearly all of it. My offer, however, guarantees you a nominal $801,000, which at the current multiplier (0.512) gives you approximately $410,112 in real terms—better than your fallback. Let’s avoid further devaluation and settle now.""}"
