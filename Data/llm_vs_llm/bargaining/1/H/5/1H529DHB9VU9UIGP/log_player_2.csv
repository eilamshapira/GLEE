"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically:

1. She's offering me $350,000 (35%) while keeping $650,000 (65%)
2. This is the first round, and I have plenty of opportunities to make counter-offers
3. There's no inflation effect for me, so the money's value remains constant
4. Since the split isn't close to 50-50 and I have more chances, I should try to negotiate better terms

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice made an aggressive first move:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable counter-offer because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50-50 split
2. It gives me a slight advantage (55%) but isn't as extreme as Alice's first offer
3. It's a significant improvement for me while still giving Alice a substantial amount
4. Since there's no inflation effect on my side, I can afford to negotiate firmly"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $350,000 to $400,000
2. I know her share ($600,000) is now worth 36% less to her due to inflation, so it's effectively worth only $384,000 to her
3. My $400,000 would still be worth full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. However, I believe I can still get a better deal since:
   - The offer is still significantly in her favor (60-40 split)
   - I know her money is losing value with each round
   - There are still many rounds left

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now affected by significant inflation (36%), while mine isn't, I'll maintain a firm position but make it slightly more attractive than my last offer:

{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000}

Reasoning:
1. This is still a good offer for me (53%) but more favorable to Alice than my last offer
2. Due to the 36% inflation on Alice's side, her $470,000 is actually worth only about $300,800 to her
3. She might be more inclined to accept now since:
   - Her money's value is decreasing with each round
   - This offer gives her more nominal money than my previous one
   - Further delays will only reduce the real value of her share
4. I'm maintaining a strong negotiating position while showing some flexibility"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $420,000
2. Her share ($580,000) is now worth 59.04% less due to inflation, so it's effectively worth only about $237,568 to her
3. My $420,000 would still be worth full value
4. The inflation is severely impacting Alice's position, but she's still trying to maintain a 58-42 split
5. Given that:
   - The inflation rate is growing significantly
   - I'm still getting better offers each round
   - I have no inflation pressure
   - There are still 7 rounds left
   - The current split is still notably in her favor

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the significant inflation effect on Alice's side (59.04%), I'll make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}

Reasoning:
1. I'm making my offer more balanced (51-49 split) because:
   - Due to the severe inflation, Alice's $490,000 is only worth about $200,704 to her
   - The inflation rate is growing rapidly for her
   - She might be more motivated to accept now to avoid further value loss
2. This is still good for me because:
   - I get a majority share ($510,000)
   - My money maintains full value
   - If she rejects, her future gains will be worth even less
3. This appears more fair in nominal terms, which might make it psychologically easier for Alice to accept
4. It shows I'm willing to be reasonable while still maintaining an advantage"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me to $450,000 (up from $420,000)
2. Her share ($550,000) is now worth 73.79% less due to inflation, so it's effectively worth only about $144,155 to her
3. My $450,000 would still be worth full value
4. The situation has changed significantly:
   - Alice is now offering me 45% of the total
   - Her share is worth dramatically less to her due to severe inflation
   - We're in round 7 of 12, so pressure is building
   - The offer is the best I've received so far

Since the inflation is severely impacting Alice's position and this is a significantly improved offer, I should accept. Further rounds might yield marginally better nominal amounts, but the risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement (and getting nothing) starts to become a factor.
