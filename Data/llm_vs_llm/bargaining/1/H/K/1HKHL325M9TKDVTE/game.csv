550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's start off fair. I'm offering a slight advantage to me, but remember the clock is ticking and your money will depreciate faster. Accept now for a guaranteed $450000!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. I'm willing to accept equal shares now rather than continuing negotiations where inflation will hurt my position. This gives us both a significant amount and ends the game quickly with mutual benefit.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your initial desire for a 50/50 split, but inflation is working against you. Your $500000 offer is now only worth $400000 to you. My offer of $400000 is the same value for you as your previous offer. Take it now, or it decreases again next round.",Alice,3,
