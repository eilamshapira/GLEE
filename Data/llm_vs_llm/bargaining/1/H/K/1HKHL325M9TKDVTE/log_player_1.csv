"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. I'm willing to accept equal shares now rather than continuing negotiations where inflation will hurt my position. This gives us both a significant amount and ends the game quickly with mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
