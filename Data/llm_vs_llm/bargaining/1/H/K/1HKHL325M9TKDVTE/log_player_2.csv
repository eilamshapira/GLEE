"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start off fair. I'm offering a slight advantage to me, but remember the clock is ticking and your money will depreciate faster. Accept now for a guaranteed $450000! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject, we move to round 2, where my money would be worth 20% less, but I get to make the next offer.

If I accept now, I get $450,000.
If I reject and we go to round 2, the maximum I could get would be discounted by 20%, so even if I got the full amount (which is unlikely), it would only be worth $800,000 to me.

Given that I still have room to negotiate but inflation will hurt me more with each round, I'll reject this first offer and propose my own division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure on me while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. I'm willing to accept equal shares now rather than continuing negotiations where inflation will hurt my position. This gives us both a significant amount and ends the game quickly with mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial desire for a 50/50 split, but inflation is working against you. Your $500000 offer is now only worth $400000 to you. My offer of $400000 is the same value for you as your previous offer. Take it now, or it decreases again next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer and the inflation situation:

Alice is offering me $400,000, which after 36% inflation is worth $256,000 to me in original value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face 48.8% total inflation (1-0.8^3). Even if I somehow got the full million, it would be worth about $512,000 to me in original value.

Alice is correct that my bargaining position is weakening with each round due to inflation. Since she understands the game mechanics well and seems to be calculating rationally, she's likely to continue exploiting the inflation advantage.

While this isn't ideal for me, accepting now prevents further erosion of value through inflation.
