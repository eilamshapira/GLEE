6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering your inflation pressure, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still giving you a substantial amount. This is a fair counteroffer.",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"Due to compounding inflation affecting me (now at 20% less value), I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. Even with this 70-30 split, the $7000 is only worth $5600 to me due to inflation, while your $3000 maintains its full value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I understand your inflation concerns, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me significantly less. This counteroffer still gives you a substantial amount, considering the value decrease you're experiencing.",Bob,4,
