"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your inflation pressure, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still giving you a substantial amount. This is a fair counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning: With the 10% inflation penalty in this round, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4050 to me. I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and even though it will be subject to another 10% inflation for me, I might be able to secure a better deal that compensates for the inflation loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Due to compounding inflation affecting me (now at 20% less value), I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. Even with this 70-30 split, the $7000 is only worth $5600 to me due to inflation, while your $3000 maintains its full value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your inflation concerns, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me significantly less. This counteroffer still gives you a substantial amount, considering the value decrease you're experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let me explain my reasoning: With the 27.1% inflation penalty in this round, the $4200 offered to me is worth approximately $3062. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll face a 34.4% inflation (compounding 10% more), which would significantly reduce the value of any amount I receive. Even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, it would likely be rejected, and the continuing inflation would erode my gains further. It's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds."
