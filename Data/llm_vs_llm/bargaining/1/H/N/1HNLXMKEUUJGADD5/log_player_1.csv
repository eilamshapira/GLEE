"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given that I'm making the first move and taking initiative in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer since I know the money is worth less to Bob now due to inflation, yet he's asking for more. I can make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a more balanced split compared to my first offer, considering that Bob needs to compensate for the inflation affecting him. This 55-45 split gives him more than my initial offer while still ensuring I get a fair share."
