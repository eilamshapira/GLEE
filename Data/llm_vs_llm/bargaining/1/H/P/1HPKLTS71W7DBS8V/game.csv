6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, how about an equal 50-50 split? This way, we both get an equal share and can end the game fairly without worrying about inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but I need to compensate for the 10% inflation that affects my share. With this 65-35 split, accounting for my inflation penalty, I would effectively get $5850 (6500 * 0.8) while you get $3500. Let's agree and end this before inflation reduces my share further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on your share. How about we adjust a bit and settle for a 48-52 split in your favor? This way, you get a better deal and we can finish the game before inflation gets worse for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to account for inflation, but let me show you the math: With the current 27.1% inflation affecting my share, a 70-30 split would give me $5103 in real value (7000 * 0.729) and you $3000. This makes our real gains more equal, considering the heavy inflation penalty I'm facing. Please accept so we can end this before inflation erodes my share even further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I see the inflation impact is significant for you. Let's try a 46-54 split in your favor. This should improve your position compared to my previous offers and help us close the deal before inflation worsens further for you.",Bob,6,
