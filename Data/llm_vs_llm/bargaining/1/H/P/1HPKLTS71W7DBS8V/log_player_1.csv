"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about an equal 50-50 split? This way, we both get an equal share and can end the game fairly without worrying about inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation affecting my share, if I accept now:
- I would actually get $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 in real value
- Bob would get $5000 in full value

While this might seem ""equal"" at face value, I'm actually getting less due to inflation. I should try to negotiate for a better deal to compensate for my inflation penalty.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but I need to compensate for the 10% inflation that affects my share. With this 65-35 split, accounting for my inflation penalty, I would effectively get $5,850 (6500 * 0.8) while you get $3,500. Let's agree and end this before inflation reduces my share further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on your share. How about we adjust a bit and settle for a 48-52 split in your favor? This way, you get a better deal and we can finish the game before inflation gets worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

With 27.1% inflation affecting my share:
- I would get $5200 * 0.729 = $3790.80 in real value
- Bob would get $4800 in full value

While Bob has increased my nominal share, the inflation effect is getting quite severe. Even with the larger share, I'm getting less real value than Bob. Since we still have rounds left and Bob seems to be understanding of the inflation issue, I should try to negotiate for a better compensation.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to account for inflation, but let me show you the math: With the current 27.1% inflation affecting my share, a 70-30 split would give me $5,103 in real value (7000 * 0.729) and you $3,000. This makes our real gains more equal, considering the heavy inflation penalty I'm facing. Please accept so we can end this before inflation erodes my share even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see the inflation impact is significant for you. Let's try a 46-54 split in your favor. This should improve your position compared to my previous offers and help us close the deal before inflation worsens further for you. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

With 40.95% inflation affecting my share:
- I would get $5400 * 0.5905 = $3188.70 in real value
- Bob would get $4600 in full value

The situation is getting worse with each round. While Bob is gradually increasing my nominal share, the inflation effect is outpacing these increases. I'm now getting significantly less real value than Bob. However, I need to consider that:
1. We're halfway through our rounds
2. The inflation penalty is getting severe
3. Further negotiations might lead to even worse outcomes for me

Even though this isn't ideal, I should probably accept to avoid an even worse situation in later rounds.
