"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but I need to compensate for the 10% inflation that affects my share. With this 65-35 split, accounting for my inflation penalty, I would effectively get $5850 (6500 * 0.8) while you get $3500. Let's agree and end this before inflation reduces my share further. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

How about we adjust a bit and settle for a 48-52 split in your favor? This way, you get a better deal and we can finish the game before inflation gets worse for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to account for inflation, but let me show you the math: With the current 27.1% inflation affecting my share, a 70-30 split would give me $5103 in real value (7000 * 0.729) and you $3000. This makes our real gains more equal, considering the heavy inflation penalty I'm facing. Please accept so we can end this before inflation erodes my share even further. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
