"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that delays hurt me more than Bob due to the 10% inflation penalty per round. I should offer a reasonable split to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split of $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where my share would be worth 10% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $4000, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
- If I reject: We go to round 3, where any money I get will be worth 20% less than original value
- In round 3, I could propose again, but Bob knows my money keeps losing value
- My bargaining position is weakening with each round due to inflation

While this offer gives Bob more than half, given the inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds, I should accept.
