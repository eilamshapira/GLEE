Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I lose 20% value each round while you don't. If we delay, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that each round reduces your payoff by 20%. In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but given that discount and the fact you’d ultimately have to concede to ensure Bob’s acceptance in later rounds, your real value would drop drastically. Accept this offer now to secure even a small, but immediate, gain rather than risk ending up with almost nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to ask for more now because my money is worth 40% less than in round 1. Your last offer was extremely unfair. This 75-25 split compensates for my inflation losses while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue further, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for additional losses.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 4 the stakes are even higher for you due to inflation – every delay further erodes your share, leaving you virtually nothing if we continue. If you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in round 5, but you'll be forced to concede everything to me in order to get my acceptance, netting you essentially zero. This tiny allocation guarantees you more than your fallback payoff. Please accept this offer and avoid further losses.

""message"": ""Bob, you're repeatedly trying to exploit my time pressure with extremely unfair offers. My money is now worth 59% less than round 1, so I need 8500 just to get about 3485 in real value. Your 1500 is still worth 1500 to you. This is my fair counter to your unfair tactics. If you reject, we both risk getting nothing in 7 rounds, which serves neither of us.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject my offer now, you'll become the proposer in round 7. Yet, given the inflation penalty you'll suffer and the inevitable outcome of later rounds – where my bargaining power forces me to keep nearly everything – you would end up with virtually nothing. In round 6, your $1 is worth about $0.33 in round-1 terms, which is strictly better than the zero you’d get by waiting. Accept this offer and secure a small positive outcome rather than risking a total loss.

Your 500 is still 500 to you. We have 5 rounds left - if we don't reach an agreement, we both get zero. Is getting nothing really better than 500 for you?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll enter round 9 with your money worth only about 16.78% of its original value – a significant drop from today's roughly 20.97%. My share remains undiminished, so waiting will only erode your gain further. By accepting this offer, you secure a small, nonzero amount instead of risking almost nothing in the next rounds.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, rejecting this offer means you'll become the proposer in round 11. However, in round 11 you'll be forced to offer Bob virtually the entire $10000, because his rejection in round 11 guarantees him nearly $10000 in round 12. With your money discounted by over 86% in round 10 (0.8⁹ ≈ 0.134), any nonzero offer now is better for you than waiting for a zero outcome later. Accept this offer and secure a guaranteed, albeit small, benefit rather than risking everything.
