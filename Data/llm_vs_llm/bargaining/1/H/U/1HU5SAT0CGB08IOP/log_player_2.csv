"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I lose 20% value each round while you don't. If we delay, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my losses.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2

In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but given that discount and the fact you’d ultimately have to concede to ensure Bob’s acceptance in later rounds, your real value would drop drastically. Accept this offer now to secure even a small, but immediate, gain rather than risk ending up with almost nothing.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to ask for more now because my money is worth 40% less than in round 1. Your last offer was extremely unfair. This 75-25 split compensates for my inflation losses while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue further, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for additional losses.

This tiny allocation guarantees you more than your fallback payoff. Please accept this offer and avoid further losses.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're repeatedly trying to exploit my time pressure with extremely unfair offers. My money is now worth 59% less than round 1, so I need 8500 just to get about 3485 in real value. Your 1500 is still worth 1500 to you. This is my fair counter to your unfair tactics. If you reject, we both risk getting nothing in 7 rounds, which serves neither of us.

Yet, given the inflation penalty you'll suffer and the inevitable outcome of later rounds – where my bargaining power forces me to keep nearly everything – you would end up with virtually nothing. In round 6, your $1 is worth about $0.33 in round-1 terms, which is strictly better than the zero you’d get by waiting. Accept this offer and secure a small positive outcome rather than risking a total loss.""}"

Alice's offer:

Your 500 is still 500 to you. We have 5 rounds left - if we don't reach an agreement, we both get zero. Is getting nothing really better than 500 for you?

Holding out now is more beneficial to me, so I must reject your proposal.""}"

I am confident that waiting will allow me to claim nearly all of the $10,000, so I must reject this proposal.""}"
