"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm playing as Alice and need to consider the 20% inflation penalty per round, I should make a reasonable first offer. A fair but slightly advantageous split would be best to avoid going to further rounds where my share would be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a favorable split for me while still giving Bob a substantial portion, making it likely for him to accept rather than risk the next round where the total value will decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 20% inflation, $50 in round 2 is actually worth $40 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. While Bob's offer is equal in nominal terms, I'm already losing value due to inflation
4. Making another counter-offer is risky as further rounds will reduce my value even more

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. Getting $40 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.
