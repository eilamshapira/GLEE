"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $100, considering that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20% in each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives both of us a significant portion, with me getting a slightly larger share. Since inflation will affect my earnings if we move to future rounds but won't affect Bob's, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer is fair as it leaves Bob with a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Although the split is now 45-55 in Bob's favor, it's still a reasonable division. If I were to reject and propose in the next round, I'd be affected by another 20% inflation, meaning my share would be worth even less to me. The 45% I receive now is worth more than potentially getting a larger percentage in the next round after inflation. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and conclude the game."
