"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round. Since Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, in the next round the $100 would only be worth $80 to her, while still worth $100 to me.

This means I could likely negotiate a better deal in the next round, as Alice would want to avoid further devaluation of her share. With this inflation pressure working in my favor, I should be able to get more than $40.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, the $100 is now worth only $80 to her. I can use this to negotiate a better deal. If she rejects my offer, in the next round it would only be worth $64 to her, while still $100 to me.

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than her first offer, but still leaves her with enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This way I get $55, and her $45 (while worth only $36 to her due to inflation) is still better than risking another round where her share would be worth even less."
