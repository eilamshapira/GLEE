3448.28,6551.72,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split: I take $3448.28 and you take $6551.72. Considering that with each extra round my money loses 10% of its value while yours only loses 5%, I believe this division fairly reflects our respective positions and incentives to settle quickly. I hope you agree and we can conclude the division without further delay. – Alice",Alice,1,
