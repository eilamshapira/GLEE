"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split: I take $3448.28 and you take $6551.72. Considering that with each extra round my money loses 10% of its value while yours only loses 5%, I believe this division fairly reflects our respective positions and incentives to settle quickly. I hope you agree and we can conclude the division without further delay. – Alice 
# Bob gain: 6551.72 
# Alice gain: 3448.28 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she's proposing I get $6,551.72 and she gets $3,448.28.

Let me analyze this: With each passing round, my money loses 5% value while Alice's loses 10%. This means I have less time pressure than Alice does, which gives me some negotiating advantage. 

If I reject this offer, we'll go to another round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, the total value would decrease (my share would be worth 5% less, and Alice's would be worth 10% less).

Given that Alice has offered me about 65.5% of the total amount, which acknowledges my stronger position due to the different inflation rates, this seems like a fair offer.
