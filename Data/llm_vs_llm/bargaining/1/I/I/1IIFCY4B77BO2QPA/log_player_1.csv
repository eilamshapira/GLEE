"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't lose value. This gives me some negotiating leverage, but I still want to make a reasonable offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because while I'm taking a larger share, I'm still leaving Bob with a significant portion. If Bob rejects this, their next counteroffer would be worth less to them due to the 5% inflation penalty."
