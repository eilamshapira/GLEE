"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. If I reject, in the next round $100 will effectively be worth $95 to me
5. That means even if I got $50 in the next round, it would only be worth $47.50 to me
6. The current $40 offer is better than risking a worse outcome after inflation

While the split isn't entirely fair, the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject. $40 now is better than potentially getting less value after inflation.
