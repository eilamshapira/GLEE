"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the division of $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 5% penalty per round. If we delay, I lose value while you don't. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and avoids unnecessary depreciation of the total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money doesn't depreciate for me and you face a 5% penalty per round, I'm making a counteroffer that slightly favors me. This way, we both get a significant amount, but it's more reasonable considering the depreciation affects you, not me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5300, 
""bob_gain"": 4700, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical and end this. The money is now worth 10% less to me due to inflation, so I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you compared to my first proposal. If we keep going, I'll have to ask for even more to offset my losses, which isn't ideal for either of us. This is a fair compromise given our different inflation situations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the money has depreciated significantly for you by now, I'm making an offer that takes into account the current value. Since my share doesn't depreciate, I'm willing to give you a substantial amount, but I need to prioritize my own gain given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've now lost nearly 15% of value due to inflation while you've lost nothing. If we continue this pattern, I'll need to ask for increasingly more just to maintain the same real value, which isn't productive for either of us. This offer gives me 5500, which after the 14.26% inflation is actually worth only about 4715 to me in round 1 terms. This is fair considering you face no depreciation. Let's conclude this negotiation now.""}"
