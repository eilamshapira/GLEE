"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 5% penalty per round. If we delay, I lose value while you don't. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and avoids unnecessary depreciation of the total value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Since the money doesn't depreciate for me and you face a 5% penalty per round, I'm making a counteroffer that slightly favors me. This way, we both get a significant amount, but it's more reasonable considering the depreciation affects you, not me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical and end this. The money is now worth 10% less to me due to inflation, so I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you compared to my first proposal. If we keep going, I'll have to ask for even more to offset my losses, which isn't ideal for either of us. This is a fair compromise given our different inflation situations. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Considering the money has depreciated significantly for you by now, I'm making an offer that takes into account the current value. Since my share doesn't depreciate, I'm willing to give you a substantial amount, but I need to prioritize my own gain given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've now lost nearly 15% of value due to inflation while you've lost nothing. If we continue this pattern, I'll need to ask for increasingly more just to maintain the same real value, which isn't productive for either of us. This offer gives me 5500, which after the 14.26% inflation is actually worth only about 4715 to me in round 1 terms. This is fair considering you face no depreciation. Let's conclude this negotiation now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
