"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob! A fair start for a long game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered an equal split of $500,000 each, which is completely fair. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, there are a few considerations:

1. This is a fair offer that gives me a significant amount
2. Rejecting could lead to more aggressive negotiations and potentially worse outcomes
3. There's always the risk of not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds if we start with rejections
4. An equal split is a common solution in such games that tends to satisfy both parties

Given these factors, I'll accept this reasonable first offer.
