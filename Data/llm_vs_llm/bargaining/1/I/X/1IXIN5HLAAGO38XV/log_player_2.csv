"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40%) while keeping 6000$ (60%) for herself. 

While this isn't an even split, I should consider:
1. There's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds
2. 4000$ is still a significant amount
3. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in the next round

Since there's no inflation risk for me and I believe I could get a better deal, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being diplomatic.

""message"": ""I suggest a 50-50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both win equally.""}"
