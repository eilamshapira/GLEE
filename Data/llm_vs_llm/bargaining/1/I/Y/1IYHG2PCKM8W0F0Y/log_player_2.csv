"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $4,000 for me, $6,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the next round's total value will be worth 20% less to me
3. In round 2, I would be making the offer, but the $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me
4. Even if I propose a more favorable split in round 2, I need to consider that:
   - Alice might reject
   - The absolute value I get might be lower due to inflation

While a 60-40 split favors Alice, getting $4,000 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds due to inflation. It's a reasonable first offer.
