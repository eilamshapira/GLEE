"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests, recognizing that the money loses value for Bob over time but not for me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair split considering Bob faces a 5% loss in value each round if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,500, which has full value for me
2. He wants $5,500, but this is actually worth 5% less to him due to inflation, so it's effectively worth $5,225 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - My money maintains its value
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for the next round

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer in round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's value is now reduced by 10% (5% per previous round), I can propose a split that accounts for this depreciation while remaining attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I propose I get $6,500 and Bob gets $3,500. This is reasonable because:
1. Bob's $3,500 is actually worth only $3,150 to him due to the 10% cumulative inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (15% less)
3. The diminishing value for Bob makes accepting now more attractive than continuing to negotiate"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,200, which has full value for me
2. He wants $5,800, but this is worth 14.26% less to him due to inflation, so it's effectively worth about $4,973 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 5, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 19% less
   - My money maintains its value
4. The inflation effect is becoming quite significant, giving me even more leverage in the next round
5. $4,200 is less than what I was offered in round 2 ($4,500)

Given these factors, I should reject and make a more aggressive offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the cumulative inflation effect now being quite significant (Bob's money is worth about 19% less), I can make a stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I propose I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. This is strategic because:
1. Bob's $3,000 is actually worth only about $2,430 to him due to the 19% cumulative inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (around 24% less)
3. The rapidly diminishing value for Bob makes accepting now significantly better than continuing negotiation
4. Further delays will only erode his purchasing power more dramatically"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,000, which has full value for me
2. He wants $6,000, but this is worth 22.62% less to him due to inflation, so it's effectively worth about $4,643 to him
3. This offer ($4,000) is worse than his previous offers ($4,200 in round 4, $4,500 in round 2)
4. If I reject, we go to round 7, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 27% less
   - My money maintains its value
5. Bob's declining offers suggest he might be acting irrationally, but the inflation effect is severely hurting his position

Given that his offers are getting worse for me despite his deteriorating position, I should reject and make another offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob has been consistently rejecting offers and making increasingly worse counteroffers, I need to adjust my strategy. While I could make an even more aggressive offer due to the ~27% inflation effect, I'll slightly moderate my demand to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200}

I propose I get $6,800 and Bob gets $3,200. This is slightly more moderate than my last offer because:
1. Despite the strong inflation effect working in my favor, continuing the negotiation isn't beneficial if we can't reach agreement
2. Bob's $3,200 is worth about $2,336 to him due to the 27% cumulative inflation
3. If he rejects, his next round will face about 32% inflation
4. This offer is more generous than my last one ($7,000/$3,000) to show willingness to compromise
5. It's still a good deal for me while giving Bob a reason to stop the declining value of his share"
