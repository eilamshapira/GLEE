"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I propose that I receive $30.66 and you get $69.34. Given that each passing round devalues the money (20% for me, 10% for you), reaching an agreement now is in both our interests. This division takes into account our different waiting costs, and by accepting it you secure a high payoff compared to what you’d get if we drag out the negotiations. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 69.34 
# Alice gain: 30.66
