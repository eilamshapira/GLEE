"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With 20% inflation per round affecting my gains:
* If I accept now: I get $500,000
* If I reject and propose next round: Any amount I get will be worth 20% less
* Maximum I could get next round would be $1M, but worth only $800,000 due to inflation
* There's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and inflation will reduce my purchasing power in future rounds, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept. Getting $500,000 now is better than risking a worse outcome later.
