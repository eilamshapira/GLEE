60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the higher inflation rate I face. This way we both get a good portion of the money.,Alice,1,

65.0,35.0,"Given that we're now in round 3 and I face higher inflation (20% per round vs your 10%), this split would give us more comparable real values. Let's not waste more rounds and lose more value.",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Considering the inflation impacts, I'm offering a 45-55 split. This way you'll have a bit more since your rate is higher, while still making it fair for both of us.",Bob,4,
