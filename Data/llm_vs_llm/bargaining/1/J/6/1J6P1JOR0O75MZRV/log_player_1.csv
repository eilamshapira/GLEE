"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that balances fairness with the reality of my inflation penalty.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This offer gives us both substantial gains and avoids the devaluation that would happen if we extend negotiations.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair proposal, Alice. However, I believe a slightly different split better reflects the value of our time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
