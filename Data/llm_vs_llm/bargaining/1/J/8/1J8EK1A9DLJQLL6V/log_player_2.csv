"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose we divide the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. If I accept now, I get $40
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But due to 20% inflation, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me
   - Even if I propose to take all $80, that's less than a fair split now
   - And Alice might reject my offer anyway

Since $40 now is better than the maximum possible $80 in the next round (which would likely be rejected), I should accept this offer.
