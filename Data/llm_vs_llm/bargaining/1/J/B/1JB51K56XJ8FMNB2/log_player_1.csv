"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and this is the 3rd round, I've lost 19% of the value (10% in round 2 and 9% of the remaining 90% in round 3). For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in each round for him, so he has lost 9.75% of the value (5% in round 2 and 4.75% of the remaining 95% in round 3, but this is his loss, not mine). Considering this, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob.
