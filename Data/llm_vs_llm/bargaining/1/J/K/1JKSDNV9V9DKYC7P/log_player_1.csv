# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With each round, my share loses more value. Let's agree on an equal split of 50-50 to end this before inflation takes a bigger toll on my side. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","An equal split? That's a generous offer from Bob, considering the inflation affecting his share. I think it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing everything if we can't come to an agreement.
