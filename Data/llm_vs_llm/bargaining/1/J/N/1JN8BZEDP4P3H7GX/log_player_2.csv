"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer doesn't seem fair to me. Alice is offering me only 20% of the total amount while keeping 80% for herself. Given that inflation affects me less than it affects Alice (10% vs 20% per round), I have an advantage by continuing to the next round where I can make a more equitable proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our inflation rates. Since Alice's money depreciates faster (20% vs my 10%), she has more incentive to reach a quicker agreement, but I'll still propose a fair split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly favorable split to myself, but still quite equitable. Since inflation will reduce the total value more severely for Alice than for me, this is actually a reasonable compromise that acknowledges our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice should accept rather than risk another round of depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Due to inflation, the money has depreciated significantly:

- For me, the $3,500 is worth 19% less than in round 1, so it's equivalent to about $2,835 of the original value
- For Alice, the $6,500 is worth 36% less than in round 1, so it's equivalent to about $4,160 of the original value

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will depreciate further. The offer has improved from Alice's initial proposal of $2,000 for me. While still not an even split, it acknowledges our different inflation rates.

Given the trajectory of negotiations and the accelerating effects of inflation, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
