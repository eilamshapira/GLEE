"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the 20% inflation effect on my side for each passing round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm facing 20% inflation with each round. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to agree now rather than lose value through delays.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because it was too skewed in your favor. I propose an equal split of 5000$ each. This is fair and considering the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
