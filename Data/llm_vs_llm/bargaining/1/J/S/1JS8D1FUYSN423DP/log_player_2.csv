"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm facing 20% inflation with each round. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to agree now rather than lose value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because it was too skewed in your favor. I propose an equal split of 5000$ each. This is fair and considering the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us to settle now.""}"
