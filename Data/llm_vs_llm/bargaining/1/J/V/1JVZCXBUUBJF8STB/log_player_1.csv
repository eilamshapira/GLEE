"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer to Bob, recognizing that we both need to reach an agreement but also considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a reasonable starting offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair to Bob. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round while I don't, he has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner."
