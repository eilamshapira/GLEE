"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000 (45%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my money will be worth less next round
4. $4,500 now is better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less due to inflation

While it's not a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I face. If I reject, any amount I get in future rounds will be worth at least 5% less. The risk of negotiating further outweighs the potential benefit.
