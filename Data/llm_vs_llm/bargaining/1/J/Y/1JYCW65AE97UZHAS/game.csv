450000.0,550000.0,I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It acknowledges that we both have a role in this game and gives us both a good share of the reward. Let's work together and find a solution that benefits us both.,Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while acknowledging the diminishing value of the money for me. What do you say?",Alice,3,
