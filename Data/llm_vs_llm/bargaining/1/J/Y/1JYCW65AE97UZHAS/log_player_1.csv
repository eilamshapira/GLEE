"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It acknowledges that we both have a role in this game and gives us both a good share of the reward. Let's work together and find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
