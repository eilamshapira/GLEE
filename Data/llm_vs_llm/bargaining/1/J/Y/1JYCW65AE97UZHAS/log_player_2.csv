Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while acknowledging the diminishing value of the money for me. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
