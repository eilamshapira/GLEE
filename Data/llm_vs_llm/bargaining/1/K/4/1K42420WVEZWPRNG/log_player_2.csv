"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 69, ""alice_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Alice, note that with each round the pie shrinks for both of us – yours even faster. Accepting my proposal now secures you 31, which is better than waiting another round and facing further devaluation. Let's close the deal before the money loses more of its value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer gives you more than your previous proposal, and it's fair considering the inflation. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""explanation"": ""By rejecting this round, I'll get to propose in round 4 where, despite further inflation, I can secure nearly the entire pie. In round 3 the 46 I’d nominally receive is worth only about 41.5 in first-round value, whereas as the proposer in the next round I could obtain an effective payoff of roughly 85.7. So, it's in my best interest to reject this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 69, ""alice_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation is biting us both – your share drops from a 0.729 multiplier now to 0.6561 if we delay further. By accepting this offer, you receive $31 nominal, which is more valuable than the pie you'll command as proposer next round. Let's secure our shares before the money loses even more of its worth.""}"
