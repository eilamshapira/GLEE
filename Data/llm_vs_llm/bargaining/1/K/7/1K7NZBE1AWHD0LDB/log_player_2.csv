"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value will be worth 10% less for me ($9000 effective value)
   * For Alice, it will be worth 5% less ($9500 effective value)
   * This puts me at a disadvantage for negotiations

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the depreciation factor makes waiting costly. If I reject, I'll have less total value to work with, and Alice might still reject my counter-offer, leading to even more value loss.
