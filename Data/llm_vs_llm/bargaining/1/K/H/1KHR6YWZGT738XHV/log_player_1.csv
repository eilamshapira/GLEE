"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from delaying.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $4,500 with 10% inflation penalty = $4,050 effective value
* If I reject and we continue to next round, any amount will be worth 20% less than original value
* Bob's current offer gives me a reasonable share, and continuing would mean significant value loss
* The difference between this and my original offer (after inflation) isn't worth the risk of further devaluation
