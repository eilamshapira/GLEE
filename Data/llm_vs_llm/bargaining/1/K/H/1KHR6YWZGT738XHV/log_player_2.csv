"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from delaying. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While she might be as concerned about inflation as I am,  there's no guarantee of that. It's worth risking one round of inflation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, it's a fair starting point for negotiation.""} 

While I'm aiming for a slight advantage, I'm keeping my offer reasonable to encourage Alice to negotiate rather than simply rejecting it outright."
