"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept while accounting for the 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which is generally seen as fair
2. If Bob rejects and we go to next round, my potential gain would be reduced by 20%, so I need to secure a good deal now
3. It gives Bob a significant portion while still being slightly advantageous to me as the first mover"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offering me $5000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $4000 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offering an equal split in nominal terms, but due to inflation, it's actually significantly in his favor
4. However, if I reject, my negotiating position will be even weaker in the next round

Given that my position will only get worse in future rounds due to inflation, I should accept this offer even though it's not ideal.
