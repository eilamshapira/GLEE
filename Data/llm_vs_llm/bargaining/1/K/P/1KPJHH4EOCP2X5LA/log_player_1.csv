Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose an equal split of $50 each. By agreeing now, we both avoid further devaluation (my share drops 5% every round). I believe a fair and prompt agreement works best for both of us—let’s settle on this now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
