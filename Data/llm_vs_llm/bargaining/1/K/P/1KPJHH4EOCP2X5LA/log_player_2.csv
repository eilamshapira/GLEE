Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the equal split idea, but it's important to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's do 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
