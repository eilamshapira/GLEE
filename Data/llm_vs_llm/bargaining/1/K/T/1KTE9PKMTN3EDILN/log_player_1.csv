"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that allows us both to benefit equally from the available funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While I'm getting slightly less than half, the 20% inflation penalty I face makes this a reasonable compromise rather than waiting for a future round where my share would be worth even less."
