"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, I need to consider that I may be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. However, I also need to account for the 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

If I reject, the $10,000 will be worth $8,000 in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it too.

Given the significant inflation penalty and that $4000 is a reasonable amount (40% of the total), I'll make a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counteroffer while accounting for the inflation. Since the money is now worth 20% less to me, I should aim for a slightly better split than what Alice offered.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. This gives me $5000, which after accounting for the 20% inflation is worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 to me (the same as Alice's original offer), but it respects the principle of equality in division."
