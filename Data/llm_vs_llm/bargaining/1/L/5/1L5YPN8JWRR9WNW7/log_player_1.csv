Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle with an even split considering future depreciation: I'll take 600k, and you get 400k. It's a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that money devalues faster for you (10%) than for me (5%), a 50-50 split is actually more favorable to you in the long run. If we keep negotiating, both our shares will be worth less. Let's agree to this fair split now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
