"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle with an even split considering future depreciation: I'll take 600k, and you get 400k. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

1. Alice is offering a 60-40 split in her favor
2. The money loses value faster for Alice (10% per round) than for me (5% per round)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, though my money will be worth 5% less
4. With many rounds left, I have room to negotiate for a better deal
5. This initial offer seems too favorable to Alice given the inflation differences

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the different inflation rates (10% for Alice vs 5% for me), I should propose a more balanced split that accounts for this difference.
