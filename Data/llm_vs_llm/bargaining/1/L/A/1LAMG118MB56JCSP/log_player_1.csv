"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for myself, recognizing that with each passing round, the total value decreases for me by 5% but not for Bob. This gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. This is a fair division, and since inflation affects only my portion (5% per round), accepting now rather than negotiating further rounds is financially prudent for me."
