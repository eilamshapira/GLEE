Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by accepting this proposal you secure an effective 166667 dollars—exactly what you could expect if you waited another round given your 20% devaluation. I believe this fair‐equilibrium split (with 83.33% going to me and 16.67% to you) reflects our respective costs of delay. Let's agree now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying further only deepens our losses. In this round your money is worth 0.512 of its original value, while mine is worth 0.857375. If you reject, you'll propose next round, but your extra delay cuts your effective gains further (your best outcome then would be 20.83% of the pie nominally, which is only about 208333 dollars, and once discounted, roughly 85333 in round‑1 value). By accepting this offer now—where you receive 166667 dollars nominally (an effective 85333)—you secure the highest value available given our respective devaluations. I believe this is the most rational split. 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333
