"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. It's a fair starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, by accepting this proposal you secure an effective 166,667 dollars—exactly what you could expect if you waited another round given your 20% devaluation. I believe this fair‐equilibrium split (with 83.33% going to me and 16.67% to you) reflects our respective costs of delay. Let's agree now to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to resolve this. We both stand to lose more if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further only deepens our losses. In this round your money is worth 0.512 of its original value, while mine is worth 0.857375. If you reject, you'll propose next round, but your extra delay cuts your effective gains further (your best outcome then would be 20.83% of the pie nominally, which is only about 208,333 dollars, and once discounted, roughly 85,333 in round‑1 value). By accepting this offer now—where you receive 166,667 dollars nominally (an effective 85,333)—you secure the highest value available given our respective devaluations. I believe this is the most rational split.""}"
