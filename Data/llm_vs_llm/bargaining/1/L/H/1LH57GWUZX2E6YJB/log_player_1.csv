"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gains and securing a deal. Bob rejected my initial offer, indicating he wants more than 40%. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough to accept, considering the money is losing value for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the value is decreasing, accepting $45 at this point would be significantly less than what I could potentially gain.  I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is my final offer of an even split. It seems Bob is aiming for a 55/45 split in his favor, but with the inflation working against me, I need to hold firm on this. It's a fair deal, and hopefully, he'll accept before the money loses even more value for me."
