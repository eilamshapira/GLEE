I'm still holding out for a more even split, especially since the inflation is working in my favor."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While I'd prefer a slight edge, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. The inflation is significantly impacting Alice, and it's unlikely she'll offer me a better deal as time goes on."
