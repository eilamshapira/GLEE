"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is giving me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total. I need to consider the inflation effect - if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject, I could offer a better split for myself in round 2, but the total value to me would already be reduced to 80% of the original amount. Given that we have a limited number of rounds and each delay costs me 20% in value, I should be careful about rejecting reasonable offers.

$4,000 now is better than potentially getting a higher percentage of a significantly depreciated amount later, especially since we don't know how inflation affects Alice.
