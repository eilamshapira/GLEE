550000.0,450000.0,"I'm offering you a generous 45% share. Since inflation affects my gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect yours, accepting this fair split now would be mutually beneficial.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting your gains. However, considering that fact, a 55/45 split in my favor seems more appropriate given our negotiation position. This still gives you $450000 which is worth more now than it would be in future rounds, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be practical and fair - a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. With inflation reducing my gains each round, prolonging the negotiation hurts both of us. This is a balanced compromise that gives us both a substantial share.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your move toward a more balanced split. However, as you've noted, inflation affects your gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect mine. This negotiation dynamic means a truly fair split must account for this difference. I'm offering you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation. This is a reasonable offer considering our respective positions and the inflation factor.",Bob,4,

480000.0,520000.0,"Bob, I acknowledge your position, but your 60/40 split was too aggressive. I'm offering a more reasonable 48/52 split in your favor, which already accounts for my inflation disadvantage. Further delays will reduce both our expected values - let's reach a fair agreement now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a split that acknowledges the inflation dynamic. I'm coming down from my previous position as well. This 58/42 split is fair considering we're in round 6 with inflation at nearly 20% for your share. Further negotiations will only decrease your effective value more. With 6 rounds left, we should reach an agreement soon to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. This offer balances our negotiating positions while recognizing the time pressure we both face.",Bob,6,
