"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 5% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a generous 45% share. Since inflation affects my gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect yours, accepting this fair split now would be mutually beneficial.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting your gains. However, considering that fact, a 55/45 split in my favor seems more appropriate given our negotiation position. This still gives you $450000 which is worth more now than it would be in future rounds, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty gives Bob leverage, but not enough to justify completely flipping the proportions. I'm still better off making a counter-offer in the next round, even with a 5% penalty, than accepting this reversal of positions. I'll make a more moderate counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical and fair - a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. With inflation reducing my gains each round, prolonging the negotiation hurts both of us. This is a balanced compromise that gives us both a substantial share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your move toward a more balanced split. However, as you've noted, inflation affects your gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect mine. This negotiation dynamic means a truly fair split must account for this difference. I'm offering you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation. This is a reasonable offer considering our respective positions and the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob makes a logical argument, accepting a 40/60 split this early is too concessive. Even with the current 14.26% inflation penalty, I can still make a more favorable counter-offer. The threat of future inflation is real, but Bob is pushing too hard too early in the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, I acknowledge your position, but your 60/40 split was too aggressive. I'm offering a more reasonable 48/52 split in your favor, which already accounts for my inflation disadvantage. Further delays will reduce both our expected values - let's reach a fair agreement now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a split that acknowledges the inflation dynamic. I'm coming down from my previous position as well. This 58/42 split is fair considering we're in round 6 with inflation at nearly 20% for your share. Further negotiations will only decrease your effective value more. With 6 rounds left, we should reach an agreement soon to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. This offer balances our negotiating positions while recognizing the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob has made a reasonable concession from his previous 60/40 split, and with the inflation already at 22.62%, my $420,000 is effectively worth about $325,000. If I reject and negotiations continue, further rounds of inflation will erode my position even more. While I might get a nominally higher amount in later rounds, the real value would likely be less than what I'm being offered now. This is a reasonable compromise given the asymmetric inflation pressure."
