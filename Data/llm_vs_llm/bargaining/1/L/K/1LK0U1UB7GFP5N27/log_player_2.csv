"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a generous 45% share. Since inflation affects my gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect yours, accepting this fair split now would be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45% of the total), while she would take $550,000 (55%). 

She points out that inflation affects her gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect mine. This means if we delay, her effective value decreases while mine stays the same. Given this dynamic, I could potentially get a more favorable split by rejecting and making my own offer.

Since I don't lose anything by waiting and could gain more in the next round, this doesn't seem like the optimal deal for me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation dynamic while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting your gains. However, considering that fact, a 55/45 split in my favor seems more appropriate given our negotiation position. This still gives you $450,000 which is worth more now than it would be in future rounds, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical and fair - a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. With inflation reducing my gains each round, prolonging the negotiation hurts both of us. This is a balanced compromise that gives us both a substantial share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now proposing a 50/50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us.

Alice makes a fair point that prolonging the negotiation hurts her value due to inflation (she's already lost 9.75% of her effective value). However, inflation doesn't affect my gains at all, which means I don't lose anything by continuing to negotiate.

Given this asymmetric inflation impact, I could potentially secure a better deal in the next round. A truly equitable solution would account for this inflation dynamic, which would suggest I should get more than 50%.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your move toward a more balanced split. However, as you've noted, inflation affects your gains by 5% each round but doesn't affect mine. This negotiation dynamic means a truly fair split must account for this difference. I'm offering you $400,000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after several more rounds of negotiation. This is a reasonable offer considering our respective positions and the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I acknowledge your position, but your 60/40 split was too aggressive. I'm offering a more reasonable 48/52 split in your favor, which already accounts for my inflation disadvantage. Further delays will reduce both our expected values - let's reach a fair agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer carefully. She's now proposing I get $520,000 (52%) while she gets $480,000 (48%). This is better than her previous 50/50 offer and acknowledges the inflation dynamic.

Alice makes a valid point that her position weakens with each round due to inflation (now at 18.55%), while mine remains unchanged. If we continue negotiating, her effective value will continue to decrease, but we're also getting closer to the 12-round limit where we both get nothing.

Given that we're now in round 5 (with 7 rounds remaining), and Alice has moved to offering me the majority share, this is becoming a more reasonable offer. However, I think I can still get a slightly better deal given the inflation asymmetry.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a split that acknowledges the inflation dynamic. I'm coming down from my previous position as well. This 58/42 split is fair considering we're in round 6 with inflation at nearly 20% for your share. Further negotiations will only decrease your effective value more. With 6 rounds left, we should reach an agreement soon to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. This offer balances our negotiating positions while recognizing the time pressure we both face.""}"
