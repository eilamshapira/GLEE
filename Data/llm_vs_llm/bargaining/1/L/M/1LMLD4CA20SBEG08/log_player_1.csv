"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money for me in this round, considering the 20% inflation:

*   In round 1, $1 was worth 1 unit of value.
*   In round 2, $1 is worth 0.8 units of value for me.

Now, let's assess Bob's offer:

*   Alice gains $40, but each dollar is worth 0.8 units, so her effective gain is 40 \* 0.8 = 32 units of value.
*   Bob gains $60, which is the full value.

Considering that the next round will be even less favorable for me due to further inflation, I will accept.
