"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 55/45 split and he's facing inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 10% less in the first round and another 10% less in the second round, which is a total of 19% less (1 - 0.9 * 0.9). However, I don't know the exact inflation rate for Bob, so I'll make a moderate offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's try a 65/35 split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation effect on me, let's try a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I think I have the upper hand. His offer of a 60/40 split in his favor seems quite generous to himself, considering the inflation he's facing. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split in his favor, and considering the significant inflation effect he's facing (27.1% less value), I'll try to make an offer that's more favorable to myself while still being somewhat reasonable. I'll aim for a split that reflects the increasing disparity in our situations.
