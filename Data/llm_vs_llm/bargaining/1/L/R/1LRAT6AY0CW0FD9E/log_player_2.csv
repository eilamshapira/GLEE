Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a more equitable split where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. This is much fairer than the previous 90-10 split, giving both of us a substantial amount while keeping the division reasonably balanced."
