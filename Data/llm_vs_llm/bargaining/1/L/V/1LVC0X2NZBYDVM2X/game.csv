55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Since inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs your 10%), I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me. This is actually fair when you consider future value - if we don't agree now, both of us lose value.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation difference. However, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest starting point. It reflects the equal initial value of the money for both of us.  Let's not lose any more value to inflation.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I appreciate your fairness principle, but we need to account for our different inflation rates. After this round, my money loses 20% of value while yours only loses 10%. If we delay further, we both lose. The inflation difference makes this 58/42 split actually equitable in real value - in round 4, this would be roughly equivalent to a 52/48 split due to our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
