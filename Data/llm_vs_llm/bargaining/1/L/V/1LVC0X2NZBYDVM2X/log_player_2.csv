"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs your 10%), I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me. This is actually fair when you consider future value - if we don't agree now, both of us lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation difference. However, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest starting point. It reflects the equal initial value of the money for both of us.  Let's not lose any more value to inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your fairness principle, but we need to account for our different inflation rates. After this round, my money loses 20% of value while yours only loses 10%. If we delay further, we both lose. The inflation difference makes this 58/42 split actually equitable in real value - in round 4, this would be roughly equivalent to a 52/48 split due to our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
