"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Getting only $10 while Alice gets $90 is too unfair, even considering potential inflation effects."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a more balanced split, offering Alice a fair portion while ensuring I get a reasonable amount before inflation reduces the value further."
