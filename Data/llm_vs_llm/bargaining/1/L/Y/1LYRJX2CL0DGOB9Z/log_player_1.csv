"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start fair and split the $100 equally, ensuring we both benefit equally from the beginning.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money is worth 20% less this round, this split of $40 for you is actually worth the same as $50 was to you in the first round. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now prevents further depreciation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
