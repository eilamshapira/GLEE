"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we split it equally? This way, both of us get a fair share. With inflation affecting me, I think this is a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
