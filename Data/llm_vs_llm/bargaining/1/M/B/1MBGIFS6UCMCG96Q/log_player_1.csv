Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. Accepting now avoids the discounting hit in later rounds – it’s a fair start that rewards both of us compared to the losses we’d face if we wait. What do you think?""}"
