"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. Accepting now avoids the discounting hit in later rounds – it’s a fair start that rewards both of us compared to the losses we’d face if we wait. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
