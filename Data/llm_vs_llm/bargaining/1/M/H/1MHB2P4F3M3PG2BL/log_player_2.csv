"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

With the current offer, I get $50. If I reject, even if I manage to negotiate a better split in the next round (let's say 60-40), the total pot would be worth only $90 to me, so my maximum take would be $54 (60% of $90), and that's assuming Alice accepts.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and inflation, I should accept this fair initial offer.
