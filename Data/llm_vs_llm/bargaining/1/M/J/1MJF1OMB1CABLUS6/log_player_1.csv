"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You're facing a 10% decrease per round while I'm at 5%. If we go to the next round, we both lose value. Let's settle now with this reasonable division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I value fairness and believe a 50/50 split is reasonable. If we keep proceeding, we both suffer from inflation effects, but this way ensures equality. Let's agree on this and end the game with a fair deal for both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
