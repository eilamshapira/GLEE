Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You're facing a 10% decrease per round while I'm at 5%. If we go to the next round, we both lose value. Let's settle now with this reasonable division. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hey Alice, I value fairness and believe a 50/50 split is reasonable.
