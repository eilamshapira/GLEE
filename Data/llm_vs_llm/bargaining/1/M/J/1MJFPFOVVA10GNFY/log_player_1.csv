"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, considering the future inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation that has already happened and will happen in the future.

*   **Current value of my share (considering 5% inflation from Round 1):** My initial offer was 600,000. Now, it's worth less.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering me 550,000.

Since the offer is greater than what I proposed previously, and taking the opportunity cost of the game, I will accept.
