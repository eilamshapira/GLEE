Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky. I'm feeling generous, so here's a counter-offer that gives you a fair share while acknowledging my position as the first proposer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer, but it needs to be a fair split that recognizes the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than my last offer after accounting for the 36% inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, even if it's not ideal. Rejecting risks further inflation and a potentially worse offer from Alice later."
