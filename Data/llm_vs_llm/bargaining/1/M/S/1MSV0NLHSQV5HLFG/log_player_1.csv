"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me but still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting, given that waiting will cost him due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. It's a fair offer that acknowledges both our positions while giving me a moderate advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept this offer:
   * I get $480,000 Ã— 0.9 = $432,000 (effective value due to 10% inflation)

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (another 10% less for me)
   * I would have less negotiating power as the value decreases more rapidly for me
   * Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again

Given that:
* This is a reasonable offer (close to 50-50)
* The inflation rate affects me more than Bob
* Further delays will significantly reduce my potential gains
* There's no guarantee of a better deal in future rounds
