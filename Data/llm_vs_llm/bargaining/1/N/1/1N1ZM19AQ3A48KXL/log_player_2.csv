"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make this quick. I'm offering you $200000, which is a fair amount considering the 20% inflation penalty you'll face if you decline. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth less. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. Alice is offering $200,000. If I accept, I get $200,000. If I reject, the value of the total money to *me* decreases by 20%, meaning the potential pool shrinks to $800,000 in value *to me*.

If I reject, I get to make the offer next round. Assuming I aim for a split that gives me at least some of the remaining value (after accounting for the further 20% decrease in my value), rejecting could be beneficial. But it is also risky, as Alice could propose a lower offer in the next round.

However, $200,000 is a significant amount to start with. Given the inflation penalty on me, this is actually a reasonable offer. It might be wise to accept a sure gain now, rather than gamble on a potentially better, but also potentially worse, outcome in the next round.
