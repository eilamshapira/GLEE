"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Bob, I know youâ€™re a savvy bargainer. Since waiting never hurts your full $100 while each round costs me 10% of my value, I'm offering you the entire $100 right now. Please accept, so we can both avoid unnecessary delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losing any value. 50/50 seems like a reasonable starting point to me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
