"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it equally at 50-50. It's a fair compromise and a good way to avoid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $50, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $40 to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, leading to further inflation losses
* Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is quite reasonable

Given these factors, I should accept now to avoid further devaluation of my share.
