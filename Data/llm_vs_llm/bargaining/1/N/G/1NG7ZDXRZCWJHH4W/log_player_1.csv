"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, but gives me a slight advantage since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's relatively fair while giving me a modest advantage. It's better for Bob to accept a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse deal in later rounds or potentially losing everything if we can't agree within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since we still have 10 rounds left, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Bob's offer essentially reversed my initial proposal, and I believe we can find a more favorable arrangement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise while still maintaining a favorable position for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

This offer reduces my share by $25,000 compared to my initial proposal, showing that I'm willing to be flexible. It's still advantageous for me while being more appealing to Bob. We should try to reach an agreement soon to avoid the risk of both getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that we're in round 4 and Bob is showing willingness to compromise (moving from 450k to 475k for me), and considering we have a limited number of rounds left, I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable split and the risk of continued negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
