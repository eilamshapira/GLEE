"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that is fair but still good for me, considering the 20% inflation in each round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I'll lose 20% value each round if we don't agree now. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion, and we can both walk away happy without delay.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us loses any value, and we both get a fair share. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
