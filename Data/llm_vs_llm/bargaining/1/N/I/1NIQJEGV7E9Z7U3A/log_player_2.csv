Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I'll lose 20% value each round if we don't agree now. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion, and we can both walk away happy without delay.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
