"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share, is fairer since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The total amount is now worth 90% of the original for me and 80% for Bob, so:
My gain: 400000 * 0.9 = 360000
Bob's gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

Given the numbers, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 80% of the original value for me (0.9 * 0.9) and 64% for Bob (0.8 * 0.8).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm taking a bigger risk with each passing round""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's in both our best interests to reach an agreement before the value of the money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The total amount is now worth 72.9% of the original for me (1 - 0.271) and 51.2% for Bob (1 - 0.488), so:
My gain: 500000 * 0.729 = 364500
Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.512 = 256000

Given the numbers, an even split seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk further devaluation.
