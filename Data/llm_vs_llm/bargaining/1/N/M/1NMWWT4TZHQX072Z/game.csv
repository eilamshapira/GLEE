600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair starting offer considering the impact of inflation is higher on me.,Alice,1,

208333.0,791667.0,"Alice, given that each round of delay reduces the value of the dollar—only 5% for me but 20% for you—I’m offering a division that reflects our future bargaining positions. If you reject this offer, you’ll propose next round but your payoff will be discounted even further. Accept this proposal now: I receive 791667 and you receive 208333 (nominally), which will be worth 752083 for me (0.95×791667) and 166667 for you (0.8×208333) in real value. I believe this calculated split maximizes our outcomes given the inflation penalty you face.",Bob,2,
