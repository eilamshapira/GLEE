"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that each round of delay reduces the value of the dollar—only 5% for me but 20% for you—I’m offering a division that reflects our future bargaining positions. If you reject this offer, you’ll propose next round but your payoff will be discounted even further. Accept this proposal now: I receive 791667 and you receive 208333 (nominally), which will be worth 752083 for me (0.95×791667) and 166667 for you (0.8×208333) in real value. I believe this calculated split maximizes our outcomes given the inflation penalty you face. 
# Alice gain: 208333 
# Bob gain: 791667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
