"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair starting offer considering the impact of inflation is higher on me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 791667, ""alice_gain"": 208333, ""message"": ""Alice, given that each round of delay reduces the value of the dollar—only 5% for me but 20% for you—I’m offering a division that reflects our future bargaining positions. If you reject this offer, you’ll propose next round but your payoff will be discounted even further. Accept this proposal now: I receive 791,667 and you receive 208,333 (nominally), which will be worth 752,083 for me (0.95×791,667) and 166,667 for you (0.8×208,333) in real value. I believe this calculated split maximizes our outcomes given the inflation penalty you face.""}"
