5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), this slightly higher amount for me compensates for that difference. This is fair considering our different positions, and accepting now maximizes our total value.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with your higher inflation rate, you'll still get $5000 now instead of a potentially lower value in future rounds. Let's agree on this equal division and avoid losing value to inflation.",Bob,2,
