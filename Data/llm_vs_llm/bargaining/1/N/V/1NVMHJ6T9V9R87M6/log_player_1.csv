"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that acknowledges our different inflation rates while still being fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), this slightly higher amount for me compensates for that difference. This is fair considering our different positions, and accepting now maximizes our total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with your higher inflation rate, you'll still get $5000 now instead of a potentially lower value in future rounds. Let's agree on this equal division and avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
