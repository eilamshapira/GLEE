"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), this slightly higher amount for me compensates for that difference. This is fair considering our different positions, and accepting now maximizes our total value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split: $4500 for me, $5500 for Alice
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My $4500 would be worth $4050 (10% less)
   * Her $5500 would be worth $4400 (20% less)
   * Total value lost is significant

Alice makes a valid point about her higher inflation rate, but I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Since we have plenty of rounds left and my inflation rate is lower, I can afford to negotiate for a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation rates.

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with your higher inflation rate, you'll still get $5000 now instead of a potentially lower value in future rounds. Let's agree on this equal division and avoid losing value to inflation.""
