"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject and propose in the next round, I'll face 10% inflation (meaning the total value to me would be $900,000 instead of $1,000,000).

Since I would need to offer Alice something attractive enough for her to accept, and she doesn't face inflation, I might not get a significantly better deal by rejecting. If I counter-offer in the next round, I'd likely need to offer her at least $500,000-600,000 to get her to accept, leaving me with a maximum of $400,000-$450,000 after accounting for inflation.

Given these considerations, Alice's initial offer of $400,000 is reasonable.
