Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the most fair and equitable solution. There's no reason for an uneven split, and this way we both walk away with half a million dollars.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
