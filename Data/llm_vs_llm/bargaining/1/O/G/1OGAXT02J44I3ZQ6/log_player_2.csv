"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. It's a fair start, considering I initiated the proposal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me $400,000, which is a substantial amount. However, since we're negotiating $1 million, and there's no clear reason why Alice should get a larger share, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal. In bargaining situations, the first offer is rarely the best one.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the most fair and equitable solution. There's no reason for an uneven split, and this way we both walk away with half a million dollars.""}"
