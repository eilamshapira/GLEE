Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the decreasing value, but a 60-40 split feels too uneven. How about a 55-45 split in my favor? It's closer to the middle and still accounts for the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
