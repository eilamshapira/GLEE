"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. I'm offering slightly more to myself because I face higher inflation (10% vs Bob's 5%), so the money loses value faster for me in future rounds. This is a fair first-round split that accounts for our different positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1685.69 
# Bob gain: 8314.31

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I see Bob made a very one-sided offer. Let me propose a more reasonable split that still accounts for our different inflation rates. I suggest I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200. This split acknowledges that my money loses value faster (10% per round versus Bob's 5%), making earlier resolution more important for me. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value while taking our different situations into account."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 545.45 
# Bob gain: 9454.55

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Bob continues to make extremely unbalanced offers. I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the increasing inflation impact, but still proposing a reasonable split. With my higher inflation rate (10% per round vs Bob's 5%), each passing round significantly reduces my purchasing power. This $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob is fair considering our circumstances, and we should reach an agreement soon before inflation further erodes the total value for both of us."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1162.81 
# Bob gain: 8837.19

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I notice Bob is consistently making very unbalanced offers that would leave me with a small fraction of the money. Since we're now in round 7, inflation has significantly reduced the value for both of us - especially for me with my 10% inflation rate compared to Bob's 5%. 

At this point, I'm proposing $6,500 for me and $3,500 for Bob. This reflects both the higher inflation I face and the fact that we need to reach an agreement soon. If we continue much longer, the total value will be severely diminished for both of us due to inflation."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 826 
# Bob gain: 9174

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

We're now in round 9 with significant value already lost to inflation. My inflation rate (10% per round) has reduced my purchasing power much more severely than Bob's (5% per round). 

Looking at our history of offers, it's clear Bob continues to make extremely unbalanced proposals, offering me less than 10% of the total in round 8. Given the continued rejection of fair offers and the rapidly diminishing total value, I propose $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob. 

This accounts for my higher inflation rate and the need to reach an agreement quickly before the remaining rounds leave us both with significantly less value."

Round 10

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Bob's last offer of essentially $0.01 to me was completely unreasonable and shows he's not negotiating in good faith. We're now in the penultimate round, with only one more chance after this to reach an agreement before we both get nothing.

Given the extreme inflation impact by now (my money has lost over 61% of its value since round 1, while Bob's has lost nearly 37%), and Bob's unwillingness to make reasonable offers throughout the game, I'm proposing $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob.

This offer gives Bob a meaningful amount while recognizing the significantly higher inflation penalty I've faced throughout this process. We need to reach an agreement now, as the alternative is that we both receive nothing after the next round."
