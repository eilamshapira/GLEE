Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking a slightly larger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 45 * 0.81 = 36.45. 
Still, it's better than risking further inflation.
