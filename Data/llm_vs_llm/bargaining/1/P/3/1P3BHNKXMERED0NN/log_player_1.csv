"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, it makes economic sense for you to accept this offer now. If you reject, your $400000 would only be worth $320000 to you in the next round. This is a fair offer considering the game mechanics. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
