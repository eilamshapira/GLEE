"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and get it over with! I'm offering you 400k. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation conditions.

Alice offered me $400,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total.

Important factors to consider:
- If I reject, we go to another round where I make the offer
- There's 0% inflation for me (money keeps the same value)
- Alice faces 20% inflation (each round reduces the value for her by 20%)

Since Alice faces significant inflation and I don't, I have leverage in negotiations. If we go to the next round, Alice will only get 80% of the value of whatever we agree to. This gives me an advantage.

Based on this, I should reject this offer and make a more favorable one in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation mechanics, I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for Alice's 20% inflation penalty per round while being fair enough that she should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, it makes economic sense for you to accept this offer now. If you reject, your $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 to you in the next round. This is a fair offer considering the game mechanics.""}"
