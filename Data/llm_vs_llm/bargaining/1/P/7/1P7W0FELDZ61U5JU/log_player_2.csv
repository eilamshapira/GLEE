Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, inflation is a concern. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 52 and you take 48. This accounts for some of the inflation but still recognizes my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
