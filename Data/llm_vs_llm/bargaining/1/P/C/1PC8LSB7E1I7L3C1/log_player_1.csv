"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but strategic offer considering the 20% inflation penalty per round, I'll propose a slightly advantageous split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob rejects, any future gains will be worth less to me due to inflation
3. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept this offer, my $45 is actually worth $36 (45 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's current offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal
4. However, waiting longer will only decrease the value further for me

While I'm not entirely happy with this split, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating. The value I'd get now ($36) might be better than what I could secure in future rounds after more inflation.
