"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a slightly better deal than what Bob offered. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is worse for me than my previous offer, even considering the inflation. It's unlikely Alice will offer something I find acceptable in the next round.  I need to incentivize her to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose with every round.  This offer is a compromise, closer to your last offer but still acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end.""}"
