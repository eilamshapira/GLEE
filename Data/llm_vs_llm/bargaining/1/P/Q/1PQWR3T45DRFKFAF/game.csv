400000.0,600000.0,"Given the inflation penalty I face, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This split ensures I mitigate some of my loss in purchasing power. I hope you understand my situation and see this as a fair adjustment.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I understand both of us face inflation, though we may be affected differently. Let's split the difference from our previous offers - I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor. Remember that I've already lost 20% purchasing power from round 1, and will lose another 20% if we go to round 4. This offer provides you with a substantial $450000 while giving me enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's end this now so we both get valuable amounts.",Alice,3,
