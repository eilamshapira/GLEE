"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation penalty I face, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This split ensures I mitigate some of my loss in purchasing power. I hope you understand my situation and see this as a fair adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand both of us face inflation, though we may be affected differently. Let's split the difference from our previous offers - I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor. Remember that I've already lost 20% purchasing power from round 1, and will lose another 20% if we go to round 4. This offer provides you with a substantial $450,000 while giving me enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's end this now so we both get valuable amounts.""}"
