"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the inflation penalty I face if we delay. This gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing me to offset some of my future loss in purchasing power. It's a fair compromise given our different inflation situations. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand both of us face inflation, though we may be affected differently. Let's split the difference from our previous offers - I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor. Remember that I've already lost 20% purchasing power from round 1, and will lose another 20% if we go to round 4. This offer provides you with a substantial $450000 while giving me enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's end this now so we both get valuable amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
