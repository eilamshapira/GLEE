Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you value every dollar, and while you might be tempted to wait for your turn to propose, delaying would give you the same nominal $10 in round 3. To avoid further loss on my end due to inflation and to settle quickly, I propose this division. Please accept so we both can conclude this game immediately.
