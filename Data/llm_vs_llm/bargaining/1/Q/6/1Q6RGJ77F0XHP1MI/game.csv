550000.0,450000.0,"Let's make a fair split, considering the inflation factor. You get $450000 now, which is better than waiting for the next round when it will be worth less to you.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the inflation affects only my share, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair given the circumstances, and it's still a good deal for you before the value decreases further for me.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% cumulative inflation impact on your share, this $400000 now is actually more valuable than getting a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, given the 27% cumulative inflation on my share, my offer of $450000 is still a fair compromise. It's less than a 50-50 split but more than your last offer to me, considering the decreasing value of money for me. Let's settle this round.",Bob,4,
