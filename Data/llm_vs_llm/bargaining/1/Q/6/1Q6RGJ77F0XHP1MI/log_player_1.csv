"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split, considering the inflation factor. You get $450,000 now, which is better than waiting for the next round when it will be worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects only my share, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair given the circumstances, and it's still a good deal for you before the value decreases further for me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob's offering me $500,000
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's share will be worth another 10% less to him
   - My share maintains its value
3. This means in round 3, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal since Bob is more pressured by inflation

However, $500,000 is still a significant amount, and there's always the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to suboptimal outcomes for both parties.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% cumulative inflation impact on your share, this $400,000 now is actually more valuable than getting a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the 27% cumulative inflation on my share, my offer of $450000 is still a fair compromise. It's less than a 50-50 split but more than your last offer to me, considering the decreasing value of money for me. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offering me $550,000
2. If I reject and we go to round 5:
   - The money will be worth about 35% less to Bob
   - I could potentially negotiate for an even better deal
   - However, we're already at a pretty good offer for me

Given that:
- This is actually a better offer than my last proposal ($600K/$400K)
- $550,000 is a significant improvement from the initial 50-50 split
- Further negotiations might lead to deteriorating relationships and potential loss
- The offer fairly accounts for the inflation impact
