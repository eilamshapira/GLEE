"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split, considering the inflation factor. You get $450000 now, which is better than waiting for the next round when it will be worth less to you.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation affects only my share, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair given the circumstances, and it's still a good deal for you before the value decreases further for me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% cumulative inflation impact on your share, this $400000 now is actually more valuable than getting a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, given the 27% cumulative inflation on my share, my offer of $450,000 is still a fair compromise. It's less than a 50-50 split but more than your last offer to me, considering the decreasing value of money for me. Let's settle this round.""
