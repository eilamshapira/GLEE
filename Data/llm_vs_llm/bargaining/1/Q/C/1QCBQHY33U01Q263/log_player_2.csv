"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is suggesting that she gets $6,000 while I get $4,000. Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me (compared to 5% less for Alice), I should consider whether rejecting now for a potentially better offer is worth the depreciation.

If I reject and propose a 50/50 split next round, the total value would be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $5,000 would actually be worth $4,500 to me. That's only slightly better than the current $4,000 offer, and Alice might reject it anyway.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that favor Alice, her initial 60/40 split isn't as unfair as it might seem at first glance.
