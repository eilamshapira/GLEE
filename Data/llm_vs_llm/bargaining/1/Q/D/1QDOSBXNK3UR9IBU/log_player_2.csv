"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle with a 50/50 split right away. By agreeing now, we both maximize our present value and avoid the negative effects of inflation. Let's keep it fair and efficient from the start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which means I would get $500,000 and she would get $500,000. She's emphasizing that settling immediately would maximize the present value for both of us.

Since the instructions mention that the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round (meaning there's actually no inflation penalty for me), there's no financial disadvantage in continuing to the next round. However, a 50/50 split is perfectly fair, and I could propose the same or a slightly better deal in the next round, but Alice might reject it.

Given that this is a fair offer and there's no guarantee I could secure a better outcome by rejecting, I'll accept.
