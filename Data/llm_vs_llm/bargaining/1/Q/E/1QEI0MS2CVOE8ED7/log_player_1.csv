"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation rate affects you more, I'm proposing an equal split. This way, we both get a fair share, and you won't lose as much value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
