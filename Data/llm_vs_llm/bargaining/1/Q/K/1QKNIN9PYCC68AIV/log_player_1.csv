"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a subgame‐perfect analysis of the alternating–offers game with unequal discounting (for you, no discount; for Bob, a 5% per round discount), one can work backward as follows. (For ease we assume that when indifferent a responder accepts and that “ε‐offers” may be replaced by the exact “indifference” amounts.) There are 12 rounds in all. In round 12 the proposer (Bob) can claim nearly the entire $1,000,000 (since rejection yields both nothing). Working backward, one finds equilibrium “offer levels” in nominal dollars. (Remember that when an offer is made in round r, Bob’s money is “worth” a factor (0.95)^(r–1) and Alice’s is not discounted.) For instance:

• In round 12 (Bob’s turn) Bob would offer almost nothing to Alice.
• In round 11 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s continuation value if he rejects is what he’d get in round 12. A calculation shows that to make Bob just indifferent, Alice must offer him 950,000 nominal dollars and keep 50,000 for herself.
• In round 10 (Bob’s turn), knowing that if rejected, as responder in round 11 he’d get 950,000 (which in round 11 is discounted by one extra round for him), he must offer Alice the amount she would get if she instead were to propose in round 11 (namely, 50,000). So Bob’s round–10 proposal is to offer Alice $50,000 (and keep $950,000).
• Continuing in this way one may “back out” the equilibrium shares. Without reproducing every algebraic step in all 12 rounds, the final result is that in round 1 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s acceptance condition (taking into account the 5% discount per round for Bob if the game is delayed) forces an offer to Bob of about 
  735,091.89 dollars nominal,
leaving 
  264,908.11 dollars nominal for you.

Thus, in equilibrium Alice’s proposal in round 1 is to divide the million dollars as follows (rounded to two decimals):

{
  ""alice_gain"": 264908.11,
  ""bob_gain"": 735091.89
}

This is our offer for round 1."
