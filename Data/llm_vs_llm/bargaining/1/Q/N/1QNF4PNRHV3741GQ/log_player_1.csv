# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Bob offers in the next round. He's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am."

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are only getting slightly better for me. The inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me. I'm willing to gamble that he'll crack and give me an even better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice. This is it.  I'm increasing my share *slightly* while keeping yours very comfortable.  Last chance. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""

This is a decent offer, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is starting to outweigh the potential gains of holding out for a slightly better deal."
