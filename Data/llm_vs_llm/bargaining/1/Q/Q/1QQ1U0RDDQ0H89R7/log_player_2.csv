"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal amount and avoid losing value to inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice's offer of a 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. If I reject this offer:
1. The money will be worth 20% less in the next round ($80 total)
2. Even if I propose a more favorable split for myself next round, Alice might reject it
3. We could enter a cycle of rejections where we both lose value

The current offer gives me $50, which is the highest amount I could reasonably expect in a fair negotiation. There's more risk than reward in rejecting this offer.
