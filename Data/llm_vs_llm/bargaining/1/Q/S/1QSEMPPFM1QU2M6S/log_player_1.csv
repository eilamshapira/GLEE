Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, slightly in my favor, to account for the lower inflation hit I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, the situation is getting worse due to inflation.

Before calculating my offer, let's consider the current value. For me, the money is now worth 20% less *again*, meaning it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. For Bob, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I need to propose something that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the inflation. I'll still try to get a slightly better share for myself but need to be realistic.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Bob, inflation is hurting us both! This is a revised offer, giving you a bit more. Let's take it now before we lose even more value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed hurting us, but I'm willing to take the risk. This is my revised offer, considering the bigger hit you're taking from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. Let's calculate the actual value of the offer for both of us:

*   **Alice's perspective:** $4200 is worth (1 - 0.488) * $4200 = 0.512 * $4200 = $2150.40 to me in round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** $5800 is worth (1 - 0.271) * $5800 = 0.729 * $5800 = $4228.20 to Bob in round 1 dollars.

This offer is significantly in Bob's favor. While the absolute gains seem reasonable, the reduced value for me due to inflation makes it a bad deal. I'm still going to reject, hoping for a slightly better offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Alright, this is getting dire. Let's calculate the inflation impact again:

*   My money is now worth (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) = 0.4096 of its original value. This means I've lost almost 60% of the original value.
*   Bob's money is now worth (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9) = 0.6561 of its original value.

I need to make an offer that Bob will accept, but I also need to get something worthwhile. Given the drastic impact of inflation on my side, I'll have to concede more. I will try to make Bob believe this is my last offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Inflation is killing me! I'm offering you a majority share. Please accept this; otherwise, we both lose significantly.""
}
