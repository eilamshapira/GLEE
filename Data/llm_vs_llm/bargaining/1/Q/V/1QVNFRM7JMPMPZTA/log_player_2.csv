"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation rates for future rounds.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I propose, but the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This means in Round 2:
- The $10,000 is effectively worth $9,500 to me
- The $10,000 is effectively worth $9,000 to Alice

Given that Alice values money less in the next round, I could potentially make a better offer for myself. However, if we keep rejecting offers, the total value continues decreasing for both of us.

The current offer gives me $4,000, which is less than half. I believe I can make a more favorable proposal in the next round that Alice would still accept given her higher inflation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to accept a deal now rather than continue to future rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700}

I'm offering Alice $4,700 while keeping $5,300 for myself. This is better for me than the previous offer, but it's also reasonable considering Alice's higher inflation rate. If we go to the next round, the pot would be worth even less to Alice (another 10% reduction), so this offer should be attractive enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the current inflation rates.

Current situation:
- Due to inflation, money is worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1
- Money is worth 19% less to Alice than in round 1
- Alice is offering me $4,600 out of $10,000

If I reject and go to round 4:
- The money would be worth 14.75% less to me (another 5%)
- The money would be worth 29% less to Alice (another 10%)

Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,600, which is a significant improvement. Given that she faces higher inflation than I do, and the offer is reasonably balanced, accepting seems wise. If I reject, we both lose more value, and Alice's stronger incentive to settle might not translate to an even better offer for me in the next round.
