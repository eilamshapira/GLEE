"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   * My 4000$ now would be worth only 3200$ next round
   * Any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me

While 4000$ is less than half, if I reject and try to negotiate for more next round, I'll already be at a disadvantage due to inflation. Getting 4000$ now is better than potentially getting 5000$ next round (which would only be worth 4000$ to me due to inflation).
