50.0,50.0,Let's start off fair and split the $100 equally. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation affects you more, but let's try a fairer split considering this. How about $55 for me and $45 for you?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now worth 49% less than in round 1, I propose a 65-35 split. This adjustment is necessary to counteract the diminishing value of my portion. What are your thoughts?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"I know inflation is hitting you hard, but I need a fair share too. How about $60 for me and $40 for you? This way, both of us get something decent out of this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"With inflation reducing the value of my share by 67.23% since round 1, I need to propose a 70-30 split to ensure I get a fair amount considering the diminishing value. What do you think?",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"I understand the inflation issues but at this point, to ensure it's worthwhile for both, $70 for me and $30 for you seems reasonable. Consider that the longer we wait, the less valuable it gets for you.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Given that inflation has now reduced the value of my share by 80.39% since round 1, I need to propose a 75-25 split to ensure I receive something of value. Time is running out, and we need to reach an agreement soon. What do you say?",Bob,8,
