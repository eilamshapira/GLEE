473684.0,526316.0,"Alice, to avoid further devaluation (my money loses 10% in value each round and I suspect you might face a similar effect), I'm proposing what I believe is a fair equilibrium split under these discounting dynamics. Accepting now secures us both a deal close to the subgame perfect outcome â€” 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you. Let's settle this amicably and avoid further loss in real value.",Bob,2,
