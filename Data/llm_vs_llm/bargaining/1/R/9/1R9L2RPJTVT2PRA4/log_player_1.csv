Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose a 60/40 split. This way, we both gain significantly. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further devaluation (my money loses 10% in value each round and I suspect you might face a similar effect), I'm proposing what I believe is a fair equilibrium split under these discounting dynamics. Accepting now secures us both a deal close to the subgame perfect outcome â€” 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you. Let's settle this amicably and avoid further loss in real value. 
# Alice gain: 473684 
# Bob gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
