"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 526316, ""alice_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Alice, to avoid further devaluation (my money loses 10% in value each round and I suspect you might face a similar effect), I'm proposing what I believe is a fair equilibrium split under these discounting dynamics. Accepting now secures us both a deal close to the subgame perfect outcome â€” 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you. Let's settle this amicably and avoid further loss in real value.""}"
