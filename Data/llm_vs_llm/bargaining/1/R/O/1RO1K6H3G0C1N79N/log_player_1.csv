"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like a bit more for this round, considering the next round's inflation, and I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, I am a little ahead before inflation affects our shares. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $4500, but its value will be 10% less for me, so it's effectively worth $4050 to me.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll think about the potential losses and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 19% less for me compared to the initial value (10% in round 1 + 9% in round 2, due to compounding), I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in the first round and 4.75% less in the second round (5% + 2.5% of 5% due to compounding with 5% less), so approximately 9.75% less.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit less than half. Let's settle this before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impact on both sides. I propose $5300 for me and $4700 for you. This should fairly accommodate the inflation decreases we are both experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $4700, but its value will be 27.1% less for me, so it's effectively worth $3423.30 to me.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'll consider Bob's offer.

However, since Bob's offer is not drastically in his favor, and considering the inflation rates, I think it's a relatively reasonable proposal.
