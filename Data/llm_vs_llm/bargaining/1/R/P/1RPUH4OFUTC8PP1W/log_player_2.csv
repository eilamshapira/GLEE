Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, my $40 will be worth approximately $40 * 0.81 = $32.40 (since it's 19% less than the original value).

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing for me. In round 1, the value was $100, in round 2, it was $100 * 0.9 = $90, in round 3, it was $90 * 0.9 = $81, and now in round 4, it's $81 * 0.9 = $72.90.

To maximize my gain, I'll make a new offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, my $50 will be worth approximately $50 * (1 - 0.3439) = $50 * 0.6561 = $32.81 (since it's 34.39% less than the original value).

However, since Alice's offer gives us an equal split, it's a relatively fair proposal. Given the decreasing value of the money for me, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses.
