4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your concern about fairness and inflation. Since time is money – quite literally – I propose that I receive $6000 and you get $4000. Accepting now secures your share before further devaluation, and it prevents the inevitable losses from additional rounds. Let's settle quickly and both walk away with a guaranteed amount.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is closer to an even split, considering the inflation. Accepting this ensures we both get a fair share before the value drops further.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, every round we delay costs us both dearly as the money's value drops further. I know fairness is important to you, and that's why I'm offering a near-even split—with only a slight edge in my favor—to ensure we lock in the best possible value before further devaluation. Accepting this offer now guarantees you 4800, whereas waiting for round 5 means an even steeper loss due to inflation. Let's conclude this deal and preserve our gains.",Bob,4,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, we're both losing value due to inflation. Let's settle on this offer where I get slightly more, but we both still get a reasonable amount. Accepting this ensures we both walk away with a fair share before the value drops even more.",Alice,5,

4600.0,5400.0,"Alice, every extra round means another 10% hit to our potential earnings. By accepting this offer now, you secure $4600 of current value instead of risking further losses in the next round. I believe this friendly split is more than fair given the level of devaluation we're facing; waiting for round 7 would only hurt us both. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note and salvage as much value as we can.",Bob,6,
