Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concern about fairness and inflation. Since time is money – quite literally – I propose that I receive $6000 and you get $4000. Accepting now secures your share before further devaluation, and it prevents the inevitable losses from additional rounds. Let's settle quickly and both walk away with a guaranteed amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay costs us both dearly as the money's value drops further. I know fairness is important to you, and that's why I'm offering a near-even split—with only a slight edge in my favor—to ensure we lock in the best possible value before further devaluation. Accepting this offer now guarantees you 4800, whereas waiting for round 5 means an even steeper loss due to inflation. Let's conclude this deal and preserve our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round means another 10% hit to our potential earnings. By accepting this offer now, you secure $4600 of current value instead of risking further losses in the next round. I believe this friendly split is more than fair given the level of devaluation we're facing; waiting for round 7 would only hurt us both. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note and salvage as much value as we can. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400
