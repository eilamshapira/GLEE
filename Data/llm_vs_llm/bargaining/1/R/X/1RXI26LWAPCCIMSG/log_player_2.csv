I know fairness is important to you, and that's why I'm offering a near-even split—with only a slight edge in my favor—to ensure we lock in the best possible value before further devaluation. Accepting this offer now guarantees you 4800, whereas waiting for round 5 means an even steeper loss due to inflation. Let's conclude this deal and preserve our gains.""}"

I believe this friendly split is more than fair given the level of devaluation we're facing; waiting for round 7 would only hurt us both. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note and salvage as much value as we can.""}"
