"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * The money will be worth 20% less to Alice
4. Alice's higher inflation rate gives me negotiating leverage
5. I could likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
1. Money is now worth 5% less to me ($10,000 → $9,500 effective value)
2. Money is worth 20% less to Alice ($10,000 → $8,000 effective value)
3. Alice is more pressured to accept due to her higher inflation rate
4. I should still leave her enough to make it worth accepting

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This gives Alice $4,000 which, even after her 20% inflation, is worth $3,200 to her - still a significant amount. For me, $6,000 after 5% inflation is worth $5,700, which is better than the previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5,200, which after 9.75% inflation is worth about $4,693
2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth ~15% less for me
   * Next round money will be worth ~49% less for Alice
   * I can make a counter-offer, but the value keeps decreasing
3. This is a significant improvement from her first offer ($4,000)
4. The rapid inflation rate for Alice (36% already) has clearly influenced her to make a more balanced offer
5. While I might get a slightly better deal by rejecting, the risk of further value loss is significant

Given the substantial improvement in the offer and the accelerating inflation risk, I'll accept:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
