"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair offer that both Bob and I can be happy with. Since there's a 5% inflation penalty for each round for me, it makes sense to try to reach an agreement early.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself, but still generous to Bob. This is a fair division considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since we can likely find a better compromise. Given the information that Bob's inflation penalty is actually higher than mine (10% vs 5%), we should be able to reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I know Bob faces a higher inflation penalty (10% per round) than I do (5% per round), I'll adjust my offer to be more mutually beneficial while accounting for our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is completely fair, and given that Bob's inflation penalty is higher than mine, it makes sense for him to accept this offer rather than extend negotiations further."
