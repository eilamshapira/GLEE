"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money is now worth less for me due to inflation. Let's calculate the value of the offer:

*   **My gain:** 50$ (but worth 10% less than Round 1)
*   Since the initial budget is 100$, in round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 50$ but worth 10% less, so the real value is 50 * 0.9 = 45$

Here's my decision:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. The money is worth even less for me now due to inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is getting significant. Let's calculate the value of the offer for me:

*   **My gain:** 45$ (but worth 27.1% less than Round 1)
*   In round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 45$ but worth 27.1% less, so the real value is 45 * (1 - 0.271) = 45 * 0.729 = 32.805$

Here's my decision:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, the value of money for me is diminishing. I need to be more aggressive.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is really hitting hard. Let's calculate the value of the offer:

*   **My gain:** 40$ (but worth 40.95% less than Round 1)
*   In round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 40$ but worth 40.95% less, so the real value is 40 * (1 - 0.4095) = 40 * 0.5905 = 23.62$

Here's my decision:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm becoming desperate as the value of my share decreases rapidly. I'll try to be a little more generous this time, but still aim for a decent share.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, inflation is eating away at my potential earnings. Let's calculate:

*   **My gain:** 35$ (but worth 52.17% less than Round 1)
*   In round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 35$ but worth 52.17% less, so the real value is 35 * (1 - 0.5217) = 35 * 0.4783 = 16.7405$

Here's my decision:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm running out of time and the value of my share is dwindling rapidly. I need to make a proposal that might be accepted, but still give me something.

Here's my offer for Round 9:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting very tough. Let's calculate:

*   **My gain:** 30$ (but worth 61.26% less than Round 1)
*   In round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 30$ but worth 61.26% less, so the real value is 30 * (1 - 0.6126) = 30 * 0.3874 = 11.622$

Here's my decision:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm down to the wire. My share is worth very little at this point. I need to make an offer that will be accepted, even if it means a smaller immediate gain.

Here's my offer for Round 11:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round. Let's calculate:

*   **My gain:** 25$ (but worth 68.62% less than Round 1)
*   In round 1, 1$ is 1% of 100$. In this round, my gain is 25$ but worth 68.62% less, so the real value is 25 * (1 - 0.6862) = 25 * 0.3138 = 7.845$

At this point, I need to choose between a small amount now or nothing at all.
