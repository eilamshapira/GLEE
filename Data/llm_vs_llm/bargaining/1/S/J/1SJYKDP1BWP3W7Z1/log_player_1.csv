"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), I should aim for a fair but slightly higher share to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation pressure on my side. Bob still gets a substantial portion, and we can both benefit from concluding the deal early before inflation erodes our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Due to inflation:
- My $45 is now worth $36 (20% less)
- Bob's $55 is worth $52.25 (5% less)

This is quite unfavorable for me compared to what I could propose next round. Even with further inflation, I could potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now the money is worth even less due to inflation:
- For me, money is worth 40% less than initial value
- For Bob, money is worth 10% less than initial value

I need to account for this increasing gap in our inflation rates. I'll propose a higher split in my favor to compensate for my faster-declining purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

This offer accounts for the inflation differential while still giving Bob a meaningful amount. If we don't reach an agreement soon, both our shares will continue to lose value, but mine more rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- My $40 with 48.8% inflation would be worth about $20.48 in round 1 value
- Bob's $60 with 14.26% inflation would be worth about $51.44 in round 1 value

This offer is getting worse for me. With the rapid inflation rate I'm facing, I'm losing too much value. While waiting longer means even more inflation, this offer is too unfavorable given the asymmetric inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation impact is getting severe now:
- For me, money is worth 59.04% less than initial value
- For Bob, money is worth 18.55% less than initial value

Given the accelerating gap in our purchasing power, I need to propose a split that compensates for this while still being acceptable to Bob. We're nearly halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This split might seem aggressive, but when accounting for our different inflation rates:
- My 70$ is only worth about $28.67 in round 1 value
- Bob's 30$ is worth about $24.44 in round 1 value

This makes the real value more balanced than it appears at face value, and we both have strong incentives to reach an agreement before further inflation erodes our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- My $30 with 67.23% inflation would be worth only about $9.83 in round 1 value
- Bob's $70 with 22.62% inflation would be worth about $54.17 in round 1 value

This is a very poor offer for me. Even though waiting means more inflation, this split is too unfavorable. We're halfway through the rounds, and while the risk of getting nothing is real, I still have opportunities to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a critical situation:
- For me, money is worth 73.78% less than initial value
- For Bob, money is worth 26.49% less than initial value

The risk of getting nothing is becoming serious as we've used 7 of our 12 rounds. I need to make a more compromising offer to increase chances of acceptance, while still protecting myself from the severe inflation I face.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

With current inflation rates:
- My $65 is worth about $17.04 in round 1 value
- Bob's $35 is worth about $25.73 in round 1 value

This is a more moderate offer than my last one. While I'm asking for a larger nominal amount, the real values after inflation are more balanced. We both need to reach an agreement soon before inflation further erodes our gains and we risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- My $15 with 79.03% inflation would be worth only about $3.15 in round 1 value
- Bob's $85 with 30.17% inflation would be worth about $59.36 in round 1 value

This is an extremely poor offer. Even with the risk of getting nothing (4 rounds left) and the severe inflation I'm facing, getting only $15 is almost like getting nothing anyway, as it would be worth just about $3 in original value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're in a very dangerous situation now:
- For me, money is worth 83.22% less than initial value
- For Bob, money is worth 33.66% less than initial value
- Only 3 rounds left after this one before we both get nothing

I need to make a more urgent compromise while still ensuring I get something meaningful after inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

With current inflation rates:
- My $55 is worth about $9.22 in round 1 value
- Bob's $45 is worth about $29.85 in round 1 value

This is a significantly more compromising offer than my previous ones. While I still need a higher nominal amount to offset my severe inflation rate, I'm offering Bob a larger share than before. We're running out of time, and getting something is better than nothing for both of us."
