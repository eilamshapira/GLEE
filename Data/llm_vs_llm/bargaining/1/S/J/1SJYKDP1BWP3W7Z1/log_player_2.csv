"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - My $40 would be worth $38 (5% less)
   - Alice's $60 would be worth $48 (20% less)
   - But I get to make the next offer

Since Alice's money depreciates much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. By rejecting now, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, as Alice will be more motivated to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice faces a much steeper depreciation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a more favorable split for myself, but still reasonable enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A fair split considering our different depreciation rates""}

My reasoning:
1. If Alice rejects, in the next round:
   - Her $45 would become worth $36 (20% less)
   - My $55 would become worth $52.25 (5% less)
2. This significant drop for her makes accepting now more attractive
3. The split is still reasonable enough to not appear overly aggressive"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $35 for me, $65 for Alice
2. With current depreciation:
   - My $35 is actually worth $31.59 (9.75% less than round 1)
   - Alice's $65 is worth $41.60 (36% less than round 1)
3. If I reject, next round:
   - My money will depreciate another 5%
   - Alice's money will depreciate another 20%
   - And I get to make the offer

This is actually a worse offer than her first offer ($40/$60). Given that I have the advantage of lower depreciation rate, and Alice's money is depreciating much faster, I should reject this and make a better counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 4:
1. My money has depreciated 14.75% from original value
2. Alice's money has depreciated 56% from original value
3. Alice is losing value much faster than I am
4. We still have 8 rounds left, but time pressure is building

I'll make a stronger offer in my favor, as Alice should be motivated to accept due to her severe depreciation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A practical offer given our depreciation rates - your $40 now is better than less later""}

This offer means:
- For me: $60 worth $51.15 after 14.75% depreciation
- For Alice: $40 worth $17.60 after 56% depreciation
If she rejects, her next portion will be worth even less due to 20% additional depreciation, while mine only loses 5% more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer of $30 for me:
   - Worth $24.44 after 18.55% depreciation
   - This is even worse than her previous offers

2. Her $70:
   - Worth only $28.67 after 59.04% depreciation
   - She's offering herself more nominal dollars but getting less real value

3. If I reject:
   - Next round my depreciation will be 23.55% (additional 5%)
   - Her depreciation will be 79.04% (additional 20%)
   - I get to make the next offer

4. This is her worst offer yet, dropping from $40 to $35 to now $30 for me

Given that:
- She's offering me less despite her money rapidly losing value
- I have much more negotiating power due to her higher depreciation rate
- We still have 7 rounds left
- This is her worst offer yet

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 6:
1. My money has depreciated 23.55% from original value
2. Alice's money has depreciated 79.04% from original value
3. Alice is in a very weak position due to severe depreciation
4. We have 6 rounds left, so time pressure is mounting

Given that Alice's money is worth less than a quarter of its original value, while mine still retains over 75% of its value, I can make a stronger offer in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Given the severe depreciation rate on your side, $30 now is much better than waiting for future rounds""}

This offer means:
- For me: $70 worth $53.52 after 23.55% depreciation
- For Alice: $30 worth only $6.29 after 79.04% depreciation

If she rejects:
- Her next portion will lose another 20% value
- Mine only loses 5% more
- Making this offer quite compelling for her to accept now"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer of $35 for me:
   - Worth $25.73 after 26.49% depreciation
   - She's increased her offer from $30 last round to $35

2. Her $65:
   - Worth only $17.04 after 73.79% depreciation
   - She's clearly feeling the pressure of depreciation

3. If I reject:
   - Next round my depreciation will be 31.49% (additional 5%)
   - Her depreciation will be 93.79% (additional 20%)
   - I get to make the next offer
   - Her money will be worth almost nothing

4. We have 5 rounds left

This is a strategic moment:
- She's showing flexibility by increasing my share
- However, her money is about to become nearly worthless in the next round
- I have extremely strong negotiating position for the next round
- My depreciation is still much more manageable

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can get a much better deal in the next round when her money will be worth less than 7% of its original value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're in a very strong position now:
1. My money has depreciated 31.49% from original value
2. Alice's money has depreciated 93.79% from original value
3. Alice's money is worth less than 7% of original value
4. 4 rounds left, but Alice's next round will see her money worth just 3% of original value

Given this extreme depreciation on Alice's side, I can make a very aggressive offer.

{""bob_gain"": 85, ""alice_gain"": 15, ""message"": ""Your $15 now is worth much more than any amount in future rounds due to your 20% depreciation rate""}

This offer means:
- For me: $85 worth $58.23 after 31.49% depreciation
- For Alice: $15 worth less than $1 after 93.79% depreciation

If she rejects:
- Her next portion will lose another 20% value, making it virtually worthless
- Mine only loses 5% more
- This should be very compelling for her to accept now rather than risk further devastating depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer of $45 for me:
   - Worth $29.85 after 33.66% depreciation
   - She's significantly increased my share from $35 to $45

2. Her $55:
   - Worth only $9.22 after 83.22% depreciation
   - She's clearly desperate as her money is almost worthless

3. If I reject:
   - Next round my depreciation will be 38.66% (additional 5%)
   - Her depreciation will be 103.22% (additional 20%)
   - I get to make the next offer
   - Her money will be worth literally nothing (over 100% depreciation)

4. We have 3 rounds left

Given that:
- After this round, Alice's depreciation exceeds 100%, making her money worthless
- She's offering a much better split than before
- The offer gives me $29.85 in real value
- Any further negotiation might risk the entire pot if we run out of rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's time to take the deal. While I might get a nominally higher amount by rejecting, the risk of total loss and my own increasing depreciation makes this a reasonable time to accept."
