"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a strong initial offer that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty per round. If Bob rejects, my money will be worth less in the next round, while his won't be affected.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let me explain this offer to Bob: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the next round will make any money I receive worth 20% less to me, while your value stays the same. Let's avoid losing value and make a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this $40 now, with 20% inflation penalty, it's actually worth $32 to me
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But any money I get will be worth 40% less due to compounding inflation
   - A $60 gain in round 3 would only be worth $36 to me

Since $32 now (from accepting $40) is close to the best I could hope for in the next round (and that's assuming Bob accepts), I should accept this offer.
