"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is fair. She's offering me $40 and keeping $60 for herself. Since money doesn't lose value for me between rounds, but loses 20% value for Alice each round, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split in round 2, and Alice would have incentive to accept since her $60 would only be worth $48 (80% of $60) to her if she rejects my counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. I should consider that Alice faces a 20% discount on the money's value if she rejects my offer and we move to round 3.

If Alice rejects my offer, her potential gain in round 3 would be worth 20% less to her. This gives me some negotiating leverage. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept given her time preference.
