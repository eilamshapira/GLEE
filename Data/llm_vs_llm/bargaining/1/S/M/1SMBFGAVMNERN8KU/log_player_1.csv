"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still fair, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, where I would gain $4000 and he would gain $6000, and considering the effect of inflation, I must evaluate if accepting this offer is in my best interest.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round compared to the first, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800 in terms of the original value.

For Bob, the $6000 he proposes to take is worth 10% less, so it's $6000 * 0.9 = $5400 in the original value, but this affects him, not me.

Given that I initially proposed a split where I would get $5500 and Bob would get $4500, and now Bob is offering me significantly less ($4000, which is worth $3800 to me due to inflation), this seems like an unfavorable deal for me.

Therefore, I reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round, despite the risk of further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's offer was not acceptable to me and considering the effects of inflation, I need to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. 

In Round 2, the value of the money for me was 95% of the original, and for Bob, it was 90% of the original. Now, in Round 3, the value for me will be 95% * 95% = 0.95^2 = 0.9025 (or 90.25% of the original value), and for Bob, it will be 90% * 90% = 0.9^2 = 0.81 (or 81% of the original value).

To make a competitive offer that considers these devaluations and aims for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'll adjust my proposal. I initially wanted more than Bob, but given the inflation, I should aim for a split that is reasonable and enticing for Bob to accept, to avoid further loss of value.

Let's propose a split where I get $5200 and Bob gets $4800. This way, I'm still getting slightly more than half, but not so much that Bob would outright reject it, considering the devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, where I would gain $4500 and he would gain $5500, and considering the effect of inflation, I must evaluate if accepting this offer is in my best interest.

The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4500 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4500 * 0.8574 = $3856.70 in terms of the original value.

For Bob, the $5500 he proposes to take is worth 27.1% less, so it's $5500 * (1 - 0.271) = $5500 * 0.729 = $4014.50 in the original value, but this affects him, not me.

Considering my previous offers and the fact that the value of money is decreasing, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of waiting for a potentially better deal in future rounds.

Given that I've already gone through three rounds and the value of the money is decreasing significantly, especially for Bob, I should consider that waiting might not yield a better result due to the compounding effect of inflation.

Accepting this offer gives me a guaranteed amount, albeit less than I initially hoped for, but it's better than risking further devaluation.
