Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me as I'm making the first move, but it's still quite fair. We should agree quickly to avoid losing value through inflation.""}"

# Bob's message: Alice, I think an equal split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's agree on this to minimize the loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
