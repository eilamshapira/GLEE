"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, the money will be worth:
   - 20% less for me (I'll only get 80% value)
   - 10% less for Alice (She'll get 90% value)
3. This means Alice has less incentive to reject my next offer
4. I could potentially offer something like 600k/400k in the next round
5. Even with the 20% decrease, 600k*0.8 = 480k value for me
6. For Alice, 400k*0.9 = 360k value

Since I can potentially get a better deal even accounting for inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that money is now worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice, I need to make a strategic offer that Alice would likely accept to avoid further devaluation.

If Alice rejects my offer, in the next round:
- Money will be worth 64% of original value for me (0.8 * 0.8)
- Money will be worth 81% of original value for Alice (0.9 * 0.9)

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives:
- Me: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000 in current value
- Alice: 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000 in current value

This is still better than a 50-50 split from the previous round for me, while being good enough for Alice to consider accepting rather than risking further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split to maximize our mutual benefit considering the inflation penalties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. With 36% inflation for me, 450,000 would be worth:
   450,000 * 0.64 = 288,000 in original value

2. If I reject, next round I'll face:
   - 48.8% depreciation (0.8 * 0.64)
   - Even a larger share would be worth significantly less

3. The current offer of 288,000 in original value is less than what I could have gotten from the initial 50-50 split (500,000)

4. However, if I reject, any amount in the next round will be worth much less due to compounding inflation, and Alice might offer even less favorable terms.

Given the severe inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of getting an even worse deal in the next round, I should accept this offer.
