"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","While I understand this is the first offer, I need to consider the full value of the money and the impact of inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that recognizes we both need to agree to avoid losing value to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is fair to both of us, and with 10% inflation per round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon rather than continue negotiating."
