I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the previous round's offer and the ongoing inflation."
