"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me $40, which is less than half of the total amount. Since this is just the first round and there's no inflation effect for me, I can afford to make a counter-proposal aiming for a better deal. There's still plenty of time with 11 rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, with a slight advantage to me as the proposer. It's more equitable than Alice's initial offer, and since there's no inflation affecting my value, this is a solid proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice's offer gives me $45, which is better than her first offer of $40
2. I know that Alice is experiencing 36% inflation on her end, which means her $55 is worth less to her than it was in round 1
3. My money value hasn't changed due to inflation
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but Alice's inflation is getting worse
5. This is a fairly reasonable offer given the circumstances

Given these factors, especially that Alice is facing significant inflation while I'm not, this seems like a good deal to accept. If I reject, Alice might need to ask for more in future rounds to compensate for her inflation.
