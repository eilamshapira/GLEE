"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob can counter-offer if he doesn't agree.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $40, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $38
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any money I get will be worth another 5% less
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept my counter-offer, and we could lose more value to inflation
* While $38 is less than I hoped for, it's still significant, and the risk of further negotiation might not be worth it
