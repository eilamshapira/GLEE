"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer to Bob that is fair and considers the inflation effect on my side. Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If you reject and we go to the next round, our total pot is effectively worth less to me. This is a fair split considering that factor, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts without risking further depreciation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your explanation of your inflation, but I'm still facing a 5% depreciation each round. This offer is fair considering our different inflation rates, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
