"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If you reject and we go to the next round, our total pot is effectively worth less to me. This is a fair split considering that factor, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts without risking further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
