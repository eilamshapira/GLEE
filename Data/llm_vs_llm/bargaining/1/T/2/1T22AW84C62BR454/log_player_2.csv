"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, I need to consider:

1. The 10% inflation penalty per round means any delay reduces the total value
2. A 50-50 split is considered equitable
3. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in subsequent rounds
4. Alice might retaliate with a worse offer if I reject this fair one

Given these factors, accepting this fair offer in the first round is the most rational choice.
