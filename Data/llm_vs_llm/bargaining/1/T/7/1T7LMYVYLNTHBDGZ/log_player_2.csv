"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since inflation reduces the value by 10% each round:
* Current offer: $500,000
* Next round if I reject: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 maximum

A 50-50 split is fair, and due to inflation, any delay would reduce my potential earnings. Even if I made a more aggressive offer next round, the 10% loss means I'm likely to end up with less.
