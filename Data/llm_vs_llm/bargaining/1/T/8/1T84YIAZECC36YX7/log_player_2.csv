"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me less. This way, we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. For Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount and split it in a way that takes into account the inflation difference.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this split ensures we both get a fair share. Let's agree on this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value for me is $10,000 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8) = $6,400. For Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.9025 (since 5% less in round 1 and another 4.75% less in round 2, which is 0.95 * 0.95) = $9,025.

Given the offer, my gain would be $4,500, and Alice's gain would be $5,500.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the actual value for me is $10,000 * 0.64 * 0.8 = $5,120 (since I've lost another 20% of the value from my perspective). For Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.9025 * 0.95 = $8,573.75 (since she's lost another 5% of the value from her perspective).
