"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's important to get a good deal early due to the inflation. Here's my first offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40}
```
Explanation: I am proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This gives me a slight advantage, but is hopefully fair enough that Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid the significant loss of value in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob has proposed a split of $40 for me and $60 for him. However, my $40 is now worth 20% less than it was in Round 1. That means it's worth only $32 in Round 1 dollars.

Given the inflation, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember that the money in this round is worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% less each round). I need to account for that in my offer. To get the equivalent of, say, $50 in Round 1, I'd need to ask for significantly more now. However, I also need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, knowing that his money is also worth less.

Given the situation, I'll try to find a balance that is acceptable for both of us:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35}
```

Explanation: I'm asking for $65, which is hopefully enough to compensate for the inflation while still leaving Bob with a reasonable $35. If Bob takes this deal, his $35 is already worth much less, so I am taking a risk here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is really starting to bite now. My potential gain is worth almost half of what it was at the beginning. Bob is offering me $45, which is equivalent to only about $23 (approximately) in Round 1 dollars ($45 * (1-0.488)).

While this is a bad deal in principle, the consequences of rejecting it are even worse. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to salvage something from this game.
