"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair yet strategic offer to Bob in our game of dividing $10,000. Since we face different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for Bob), I should factor this into my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly even split of $5,000 each. This is fair, and accepting now maximizes our collective value since inflation will reduce the total worth if we delay. Looking forward to your decision!""}"
