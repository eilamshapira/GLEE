"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting $40 now is better than rejecting and making a counter-offer, knowing that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round.

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round. If I offer myself $50 in the next round and Alice accepts, I'd get $50 but it would only be worth $45 to me due to inflation. If she rejects, we go to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me.

Considering the inflation risk and that $40 now is a reasonable portion (40% of the total), I'll accept this offer.
