"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering our different inflation rates - I propose 60-40 which accounts for my higher inflation penalty.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates and that you would lose more percentually, I propose to split 47-53 in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $5300, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation = $4770 effective value
* If we go to next round, all values will depreciate further (20% for me, 10% for Bob)
* The split is reasonable considering inflation effects
* Prolonging the negotiation will reduce the real value for both of us
