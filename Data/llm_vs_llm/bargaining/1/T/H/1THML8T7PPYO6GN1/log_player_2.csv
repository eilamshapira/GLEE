"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, the value will decrease by 10% next round
- But I'll get to make the next proposal
- $40 now is better than $45 after inflation
- There's a risk Alice won't accept my counter-offer
- First round offers tend to be more reasonable
