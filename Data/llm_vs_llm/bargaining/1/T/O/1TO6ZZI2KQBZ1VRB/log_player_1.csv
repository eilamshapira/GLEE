"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains but need to reach an agreement, and that inflation affects me more severely than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I lose more value (10%) than you (5%) each round if we delay. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get substantial value immediately, avoiding any depreciation. Given that you lose 10% per round and I lose 5%, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than continuing negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. My 500K is now worth 450K due to 10% inflation
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. The difference between this offer and my initial 60-40 split (adjusted for inflation) isn't large enough to risk further depreciation
4. Bob's argument about avoiding further depreciation is valid
