"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I lose more value (10%) than you (5%) each round if we delay. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   - I can make a counter-offer

While Alice's argument about losing more value per round is true, a 60-40 split still seems too favorable for her. Since I'll lose less value per round (5% vs her 10%), I have more negotiating power. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

Even after the 5% depreciation, I could potentially negotiate for a more equitable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the time pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get substantial value immediately, avoiding any depreciation. Given that you lose 10% per round and I lose 5%, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than continuing negotiations.""}"
