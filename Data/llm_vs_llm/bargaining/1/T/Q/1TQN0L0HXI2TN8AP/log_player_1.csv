Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting me. I need 60 to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, I'm willing to compromise a little. This offer still gives you a decent share.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want more, but my gains are decreasing every round due to inflation. 55 is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Bob's offer is getting better, but I'm still aiming for a better outcome. The inflation factor is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 62,
""bob_gain"": 38,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a reasonable amount considering the inflation. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's fair, considering the inflation. Let's split it 50/50 and be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good moment to accept. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is unlikely to offer more. Accepting a 50/50 split now secures a reasonable gain, whereas continued rejection might lead to a worse outcome in later rounds."
