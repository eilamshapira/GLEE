"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is killing me. I need 65% to compensate for future losses. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I calculate my gain as:

$350,000 * 0.95 = $332,500

This is not a favorable offer for me. I reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's 5% less each round, so:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 95%
Round 3: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%

For Bob, it's 20% less each round, so:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 80%
Round 3: 80% * 0.80 = 64%

I'll make a more generous offer to Bob, considering his losses due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation hit""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting you too, but I'm losing value much faster. I need 68% to make this worthwhile. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, and for Bob, it's 48.8% less.

I calculate my gain as:

$320,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $320,000 * 0.8574 = $274,368

This offer seems even less favorable to me. I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 95%
Round 3: 90.25%
Round 4: 85.74% (calculated as 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8574, but more accurately it is 0.95^4 = 0.8145 for 4 rounds of 5% decrease, I will use the accurate 0.8145 for round 5)
Round 5: 0.8145 * 0.95 = 0.7738 (but since it is the start of round 5 I will use 0.8145)

For Bob, it's:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 80%
Round 3: 64%
Round 4: 51.2% (calculated as 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096, but more accurately it is 0.8^4 = 0.4096 for 4 rounds of 20% decrease, I will use the accurate 0.8^4 = 0.4096 for round 4)
Round 5: 0.4096 * 0.8 = 0.3277 (but since it is the start of round 5 I will use 0.4096)

I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant loss of value for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious. I need 70% to even consider this worth my time given the severe inflation on my side. This is my final offer. Think about it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less, and for Bob, it's 67.23% less.

I calculate my gain as:

$300,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $300,000 * 0.7738 = $232,140

This offer is not favorable to me, but I should consider the fact that Bob is losing value much faster and this might be his final offer.

However, I still think I can get a better deal. But I'm also aware that the longer we wait, the less our money will be worth.

Round 7

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm practically giving it away at this point considering how much I'm losing. 72% is the absolute minimum. Take it or we both lose everything! 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 30.17% less, and for Bob, it's 79.03% less.

I calculate my gain as:

$280,000 * (1 - 0.3017) = $280,000 * 0.6983 = $195,524

This offer is still not favorable to me, but I have to consider the fact that we're running out of time and the money is losing value rapidly. Bob's message also suggests that this is his absolute minimum, and if I don't accept, we might both end up with nothing.

I think it's time to reconsider my strategy and think about the potential consequences of not accepting this offer.
