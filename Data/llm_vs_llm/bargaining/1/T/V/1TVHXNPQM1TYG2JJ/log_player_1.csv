"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $45 with 20% inflation, so effectively $36
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
* The game could drag on with further rounds, making my gains worth even less
* Bob's current offer gives him a majority but isn't extremely greedy

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the risk of getting even less in future rounds, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
