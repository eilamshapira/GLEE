"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose an offer that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I'll suffer if we go to another round. I should offer Bob enough to make accepting now attractive, while maintaining a good portion for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a substantial portion (40%) which should be attractive enough to accept, while securing a good amount for myself. If Bob rejects and we go to another round, my money will be worth 5% less, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $400,000 at 95% value = $380,000 effective value
- If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  * Money will be worth another 5% less for me (90% total)
  * Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation penalty
  * I'm not guaranteed a better deal in the next round

Given that Bob is not affected by inflation and could keep rejecting until my share becomes worth very little to me, it's rational to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
