550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the higher inflation rate I face. This way we both benefit substantially.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering our differing inflation rates, waiting any longer will hurt you more. With your 10% devaluation per round compared to my 5%, accepting now secures you more real value than if we delay further. I believe this proposal strikes a fair balance given our circumstances. Let's lock this in before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, due to my 10% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. This split accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both substantial value before further devaluation occurs. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

312000.0,688000.0,"Alice, waiting another round will only worsen the devaluation you face. In round 5, even as the proposer, the best you can secure—considering your 10% round-by-round devaluation—would give you an effective outcome that's barely above what I offer you now. By accepting this split, you get a nominal 312000 (worth about 312000 × 0.729 ≈ 227450 in today’s value), which is just a bit higher than your continuation value if you wait. Let's settle now before our money loses more value.",Bob,4,

580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I've adjusted my offer to still account for my higher inflation rate while making it more attractive for you. This gives you 420k, worth about 360k in original value, while giving me enough to offset my steeper losses. Let's end this now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,5,

560000.0,440000.0,"Alice, further delays will only shrink our real value—my share discounts at about 22.6% now (77.4% of original) while yours is roughly 41% off (59% of original). That means if you accept 560000 nominal, you're effectively getting about 330000 in today’s dollars. Waiting for round 7 would only worsen your position given your steeper discount. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance by accounting for our inflation differences and giving you a better outcome than the costly wait would yield. Let's finish this now before more value erodes.",Bob,6,
