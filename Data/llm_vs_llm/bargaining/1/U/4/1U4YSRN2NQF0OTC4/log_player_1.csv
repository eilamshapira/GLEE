Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our differing inflation rates, waiting any longer will hurt you more. With your 10% devaluation per round compared to my 5%, accepting now secures you more real value than if we delay further. I believe this proposal strikes a fair balance given our circumstances. Let's lock this in before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that I face higher inflation (10% vs 5%), I should get a larger share to compensate. Bob's offer gives him the majority, which would be unfair given the circumstances. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting another round will only worsen the devaluation you face. In round 5, even as the proposer, the best you can secure—considering your 10% round-by-round devaluation—would give you an effective outcome that's barely above what I offer you now. By accepting this split, you get a nominal 312000 (worth about 312000 × 0.729 ≈ 227450 in today’s value), which is just a bit higher than your continuation value if you wait. Let's settle now before our money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 312000 
# Bob gain: 688000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is now heavily skewed in Bob's favor. Even with inflation, accepting just 31.2% of the total amount would be worse than making a counter-offer. Bob's trying to pressure me with inflation concerns, but his proposed split is too uneven to accept. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I've adjusted my offer to still account for my higher inflation rate while making it more attractive for you. This gives you 420k, worth about 360k in original value, while giving me enough to offset my steeper losses. Let's end this now and both walk away with good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delays will only shrink our real value—my share discounts at about 22.6% now (77.4% of original) while yours is roughly 41% off (59% of original). That means if you accept 560000 nominal, you're effectively getting about 330000 in today’s dollars. Waiting for round 7 would only worsen your position given your steeper discount. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance by accounting for our inflation differences and giving you a better outcome than the costly wait would yield. Let's finish this now before more value erodes. 
# Alice gain: 560000 
# Bob gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering the current inflation impact. With my 41% devaluation, the 560,000 is worth about 330,000 in original value, and waiting further would only decrease our combined value more significantly. Bob has moved to a more balanced split that better accounts for our different inflation rates, so I'll accept this offer."
