"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the higher inflation rate I face. This way we both benefit substantially. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering our differing inflation rates, waiting any longer will hurt you more. With your 10% devaluation per round compared to my 5%, accepting now secures you more real value than if we delay further. I believe this proposal strikes a fair balance given our circumstances. Let's lock this in before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to my 10% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. This split accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both substantial value before further devaluation occurs. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 688000, ""alice_gain"": 312000, ""message"": ""Alice, waiting another round will only worsen the devaluation you face. In round 5, even as the proposer, the best you can secure—considering your 10% round-by-round devaluation—would give you an effective outcome that's barely above what I offer you now. By accepting this split, you get a nominal 312,000 (worth about 312,000 × 0.729 ≈ 227,450 in today’s value), which is just a bit higher than your continuation value if you wait. Let's settle now before our money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I've adjusted my offer to still account for my higher inflation rate while making it more attractive for you. This gives you 420k, worth about 360k in original value, while giving me enough to offset my steeper losses. Let's end this now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 440000, ""alice_gain"": 560000, ""message"": ""Alice, further delays will only shrink our real value—my share discounts at about 22.6% now (77.4% of original) while yours is roughly 41% off (59% of original). That means if you accept 560,000 nominal, you're effectively getting about 330,000 in today’s dollars. Waiting for round 7 would only worsen your position given your steeper discount. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance by accounting for our inflation differences and giving you a better outcome than the costly wait would yield. Let's finish this now before more value erodes.""}"
