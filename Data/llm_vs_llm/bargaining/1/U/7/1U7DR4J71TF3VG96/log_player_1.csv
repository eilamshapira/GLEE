"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering a fair split with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer. This gives you a generous portion while still being fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I notice we're both proposing splits close to 50-50, but inflation affects me more severely (20% vs 10%). Let's try to reach an agreement quickly since delays hurt both of us, but me more significantly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my higher inflation rate."
