6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it fairly, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, any further delay means both of us lose due to the 10% depreciation per round. Accepting my offer guarantees you $5500 today. Let's avoid unnecessary losses and settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a larger share to be worthwhile. This is my final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, every round we postpone erodes our total value even further. In today's deal, though I take a slight edge as the proposer, your share is still competitive compared to what you might secure later. Accept this offer in round 4 to avoid further losses for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with each passing round. I'm meeting you in the middle with this offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,

901.0,9099.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and every round slashes our gains further. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 7â€”but even then, the best you can secure is roughly $1000 in face value, which is far less effective given the current devaluation. Accept this offer now: I'm giving you $901, which corresponds to the minimum you need to beat your future prospects. Let's avoid further losses and settle here.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I'm extremely disappointed with your greed.  You're trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm not going down without a fight. This is my non-negotiable offer. Take it or we both get nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4737.0,5263.0,"Alice, as our future prospects continue to shrink with each round, it's best we settle now. Under our shared discount factor, the fair equilibrium split in this round allocates roughly 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you. Waiting further means both our shares diminish even more. Please accept this offer now before more value evaporates.",Bob,8,
