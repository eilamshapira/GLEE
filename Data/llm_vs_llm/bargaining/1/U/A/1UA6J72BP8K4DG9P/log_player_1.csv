Bob's offer:

If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 7â€”but even then, the best you can secure is roughly $1000 in face value, which is far less effective given the current devaluation. Accept this offer now: I'm giving you $901, which corresponds to the minimum you need to beat your future prospects. Let's avoid further losses and settle here.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as our future prospects continue to shrink with each round, it's best we settle now. Under our shared discount factor, the fair equilibrium split in this round allocates roughly 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you. Waiting further means both our shares diminish even more. Please accept this offer now before more value evaporates. 
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and the value is decreasing significantly with each one.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's offer is close to the split he proposed based on the 'fair equilibrium'.  Holding out is unlikely to get me significantly more, especially considering the continued devaluation.
* **Risk of Getting Zero:** If I reject and Bob plays hardball, we both risk walking away with nothing. 

It's frustrating to accept a less-than-ideal deal, but in this situation, taking the guaranteed money is the most rational choice."
