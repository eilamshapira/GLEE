"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good portion while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a significant portion while recognizing that I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 10% inflation affecting my portion, if I accept Bob's offer of $5,000, it would actually be worth $4,500 to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less than the original value.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further inflation and the possibility of more back-and-forth leading to greater losses makes this 50-50 split relatively reasonable, even with the 10% inflation impact on my share.
