"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.83, ""bob_gain"": 79.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $20.83 for me and $79.17 for you. This reflects the fact that waiting further will hit me harder (20% depreciation per round) while you incur less loss (5%). I believe this division is fair given our respective discount factors. Please accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the depreciation factors, I think this split better reflects our respective losses. If we continue, the value will keep decreasing more rapidly for you. 
# Alice gain: 17 
# Bob gain: 83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
