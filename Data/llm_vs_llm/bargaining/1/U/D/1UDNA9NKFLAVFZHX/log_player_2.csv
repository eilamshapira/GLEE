"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $20.83 for me and $79.17 for you. This reflects the fact that waiting further will hit me harder (20% depreciation per round) while you incur less loss (5%). I believe this division is fair given our respective discount factors. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83

If we continue, the value will keep decreasing more rapidly for you.""}"
