"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Alice is offering me $20 while keeping $80 for herself. If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value will be worth 20% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $80)
- I can make my own proposal
- Alice's money value doesn't decrease

Given that Alice has no time pressure (no inflation for her), she can afford to be patient. However, if I reject and propose something like a 50-50 split in the next round, even with the 20% inflation, I would get $40 (worth $32 to me due to inflation), which is better than the current $20 offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer here. While I want a better deal than the $20 offered to me, I need to consider that:

1. If Alice rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where:
   - The money will be worth another 20% less to me
   - Alice can make another low offer
   - Alice doesn't suffer from inflation

2. I need to make an offer attractive enough for Alice to accept, while significantly better than the $20 she offered me.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in Alice's favor, which is much more equitable than her initial 80-20 offer, but still gives her a larger share to make it attractive.

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}

This deal gives me $40 (worth $32 to me due to current 20% inflation), which is better than her initial offer of $20. It's also fair enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk me rejecting her next offer."
