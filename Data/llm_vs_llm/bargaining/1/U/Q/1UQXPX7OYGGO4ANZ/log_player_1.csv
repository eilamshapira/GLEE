"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. Since I'm playing as Alice and making the first offer, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty for each round. If Bob rejects my offer, the total value decreases for me, so I should make a reasonable initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, which is a fair division that slightly favors me. Given the inflation penalty I face in future rounds, I believe this is reasonable. If we move to another round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, making it in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. If I reject Bob's offer, we'll go to Round 3 where I'll make an offer, but the money will be worth another 10% less to me (20% total reduction from the original value). Bob's money is already discounted by 20% in this round.

Looking at Bob's offer: I would get $400,000, which after the 10% inflation penalty is effectively worth $360,000 to me (90% of the nominal value).

If I reject and we go to Round 3, even if I propose a higher split for myself, the 20% total inflation would significantly reduce its value to me. Additionally, Bob might reject my next offer anyway.

Given these considerations:
