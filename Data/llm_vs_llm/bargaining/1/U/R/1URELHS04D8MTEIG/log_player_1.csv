"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for inflation risk. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining my interests."
