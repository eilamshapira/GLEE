I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my gains and making an offer Bob might accept.  The longer the game goes, the less our potential earnings are worth."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
