"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Before making an offer, I want to calculate the actual value of the money for both players after inflation.

For Bob (me):
- Round 1: 100%
- Round 2: 95%
- Round 3: 90.25%
- Round 4: 85.74%

For Alice:
- Round 1: 100%
- Round 2: 80%
- Round 3: 64%
- Round 4: 51.2%

Given the inflation, I'll propose a division that considers the decreased value of the money for both players.
