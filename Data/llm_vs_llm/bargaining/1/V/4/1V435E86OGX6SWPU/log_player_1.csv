"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, since I'm the one proposing now. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation that will affect the value of the money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now: I get $40, but it's worth 10% less, so effectively $36
* If I reject and propose in next round: Any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
* For example, even if I managed to get $70 in next round, it would be worth $56 after 20% inflation
* Plus, Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given the inflation impact and the uncertainty of future rounds, this offer is reasonable enough.
