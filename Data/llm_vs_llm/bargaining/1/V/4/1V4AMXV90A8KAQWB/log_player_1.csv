"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that waiting another round will reduce your money's value by 5%, this offer of $4000 now is better than getting $5000 next round, which would only be worth $4750 to you. This is a rational economic choice for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
