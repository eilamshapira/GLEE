"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Given that:
1. Alice's money value decreases by 5% each round
2. My money value stays the same
3. I'll get to make the next proposal if I reject

If I reject, in the next round Alice's $5000 will only be worth $4750 to her. This means she might be more willing to accept a less equal split in my favor.

I could potentially propose something like $6000 for me and $4000 for her in the next round, which would actually be worth only $3800 to her. She might accept this rather than risk further depreciation of her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account the 5% depreciation Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that waiting another round will reduce your money's value by 5%, this offer of $4000 now is better than getting $5000 next round, which would only be worth $4750 to you. This is a rational economic choice for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact, my offer of $4500 now is better for me than accepting less in the previous round. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5500, which is better than the $5000 from her first offer
2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * Alice's money will depreciate further (to about 15% total)
   * But Alice might reject again, leading to more rounds
3. $5500 is a solid gain for me, and getting it now eliminates any risk

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's also a risk of ending up with less if the negotiation continues too long. This is a reasonable offer that gives me the majority share.
