Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's split it generously. I take 800k, you take 200k. No fuss, just a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we both walk away with a fair share. Considering the inflation factor, it's better to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
