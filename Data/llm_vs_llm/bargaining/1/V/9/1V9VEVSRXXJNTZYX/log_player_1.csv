"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers our relative inflation penalties.

Given that my inflation penalty (5% per round) is less than Bob's (10% per round), I have a slight advantage in later rounds. However, I want to make a fair first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

Bob, I propose this split because we both face inflation penalties, but yours is higher at 10% compared to my 5%. If we continue to future rounds, the total value decreases for both of us, but more severely for you. This division gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in the negotiation structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a revised offer that better accounts for our positions.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000}

Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you a better share. Let me explain why this is beneficial for both of us: If we continue to future rounds, inflation will decrease our total value - my share would be worth 5% less each round, while yours would be worth 10% less. For you, this compounding effect is significant. By round 5, your money would be worth only about 66% of its original value.

This 525k/475k split is fair considering our different inflation rates, and accepting now maximizes our combined utility. Further delays would only erode the total value for both of us, but especially for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're moving closer in our proposals, but inflation is significantly reducing the value for both of us, especially for Bob. Let me make a fair offer that acknowledges our current situation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. At this point, due to inflation, my share is already worth about 19% less than in round 1, while yours is worth over 34% less. This perfectly even division is fair and straightforward.

If we continue negotiating, we both lose substantial value - particularly you, as your inflation rate is double mine. An equal split now preserves more total value for both of us than continuing to future rounds. I hope you'll accept this balanced proposal so we can both walk away with the maximum possible value."
