"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that:
- She gets $6,000 (60%)
- I get $4,000 (40%)

This doesn't seem like a fair split. While she frames it as fair, she's actually taking a larger portion. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counteroffer in the next round. However, I need to consider inflation:
- For me, money will be worth 10% less next round
- For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round

This inflation difference gives me some leverage in negotiations. I think I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that accounts for the inflation differences between us.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, since money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), it's in your best interest to accept now rather than later. My offer of $4,500 to you is actually worth more than what you'd get after inflation in future rounds. This is a fair deal that recognizes our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle with this offer. It's important we both feel the deal is fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

Alice is now offering:
- She gets $5,500 (55%)
- I get $4,500 (45%)

This is a significant improvement from her first offer. She's moved from offering me 40% to 45% of the total.

Due to inflation:
- For me, money is now worth 19% less than in round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My inflation would increase to around 27%
- Alice's inflation would increase to around 49%

The gap in our inflation rates continues to widen, which works in my favor. However, Alice has made a reasonable concession, and continuing further might risk reaching a point where both of us lose too much value.

Given the current inflation rates and the improved offer, I think this is a reasonable compromise.
