"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that's fair but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a substantial amount, while giving me a bit more as the first mover. If Bob rejects, the next round's $100 will be worth only $80 to me due to inflation, so this is a reasonable starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

With 20% inflation, if I accept this offer now:
* I would get $49, but it's worth only $39.20 to me (49 * 0.8)
* Bob would get $51 at full value

If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but I'll face 40% total inflation on my share. 

Given that Bob's offer is quite fair in nominal terms (almost 50-50) but the inflation makes it significantly worse for me, and I still have room to negotiate in future rounds...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, my gain will be worth 40% less due to inflation (I'll only get 60% of the nominal value). I need to account for this by asking for a larger nominal amount to compensate for my inflation loss.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I'm asking for a larger share because $75 with 40% inflation is actually worth only $45 to me (75 * 0.6), while Bob's $25 maintains its full value. This makes the real value split closer to 45/25, which is more reasonable. If Bob rejects, the next round will devalue my share even more, so there's incentive for both of us to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

With 48.8% inflation, if I accept:
* I would get $40, but it's only worth $20.48 to me (40 * 0.512)
* Bob would get $60 at full value

This is a very poor deal for me - the real value split would be approximately $20.48 for me vs $60 for Bob. The inflation is getting severe, but we still have 8 rounds left, and I can make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I should reject this and try to negotiate a higher nominal amount to compensate for my inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 5, my gain will be worth 59.04% less due to compound inflation (I'll only get 40.96% of the nominal value). I need to propose a larger share to compensate for this severe inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

Let me explain my reasoning:
* My $85 with 59.04% inflation is actually worth only $34.82 to me (85 * 0.4096)
* Bob's $15 maintains its full value
* This makes the real value split approximately $34.82/$15, which is more reasonable given the circumstances
* If Bob rejects, my next possible share will be worth even less due to continuing inflation
* We need to reach an agreement soon as the inflation is severely eroding the value of my share"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

With 67.23% inflation, if I accept:
* I would get $30, but it's only worth $9.83 to me (30 * 0.3277)
* Bob would get $70 at full value

This is an extremely poor deal for me - the real value split would be approximately $9.83 for me vs $70 for Bob. Even though the inflation is getting very severe, this offer gives me less than 10% of the real value. We still have 6 rounds left, and I can make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

While rejecting is risky due to increasing inflation, accepting such a low real value wouldn't be rational when I can still negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're in round 7, and my gain will be worth 73.78% less due to compound inflation (I'll only get 26.22% of the nominal value). At this point, I need to be more strategic as the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

Here's my reasoning:
* My $95 with 73.78% inflation is actually worth only $24.91 to me (95 * 0.2622)
* Bob's $5 maintains its full value
* The real value split would be approximately $24.91/$5
* We're over halfway through our rounds, and the inflation is making it increasingly difficult for me to get meaningful value
* This aggressive offer reflects the severe impact of inflation on my share and the urgency to reach an agreement
* If Bob rejects, my next possible share will be worth even less due to continuing inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

With 79.03% inflation, if I accept:
* I would get $20, but it's only worth $4.19 to me (20 * 0.2097)
* Bob would get $80 at full value

This is an extremely unfair deal where I would get only about $4.19 in real value while Bob gets $80. However, I need to consider:

1. We only have 4 rounds left
2. The inflation is getting extremely severe (next round I'll only get about 16.78% of nominal value)
3. If we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing
4. Even if I make a counter-offer next round, Bob might reject it

Still, $4.19 in real value is too low compared to Bob's $80. I can still try one more negotiation round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're in round 9, and my gain will be worth 83.22% less due to compound inflation (I'll only get 16.78% of nominal value). The situation is getting critical with only a few rounds left.

{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2}

Here's my reasoning:
* My $98 with 83.22% inflation is worth only $16.44 to me (98 * 0.1678)
* Bob's $2 maintains its full value
* The real value split would be approximately $16.44/$2
* We only have 3 rounds left after this
* If we don't reach an agreement by round 12, we both get zero
* The inflation is so severe now that I need an extremely high nominal amount to get any meaningful real value
* This might seem like an aggressive offer, but in real value terms, I'm only getting about 89% of the total real value ($16.44 out of $18.44)

I hope Bob understands that this extreme split is necessary due to the severe inflation effect on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:

With 86.58% inflation, if I accept:
* I would get $10, but it's only worth $1.34 to me (10 * 0.1342)
* Bob would get $90 at full value

This is an extremely poor offer where I get only $1.34 in real value. However, I must consider:

1. Only 2 rounds remain after this
2. Next round my share will be worth only about 10.74% of nominal value
3. If no agreement is reached by round 12, we both get zero
4. Bob has consistently rejected my higher offers
5. Getting $1.34 is still better than getting $0

Given that we're so close to the deadline and the inflation is devastating, I should secure at least some value rather than risk getting nothing.
