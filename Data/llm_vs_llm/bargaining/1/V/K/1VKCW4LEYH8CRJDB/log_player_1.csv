"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest you get $55 and I get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion while acknowledging that I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I'll get $45, but due to 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $42.75 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but I'll face 10% total inflation
- Bob's initial rejection of my 55/45 split suggests he's not likely to accept a very favorable offer to me in the next round
- Further delays will only reduce the real value of my gains due to inflation

Given these factors, I think it's best to accept this offer now rather than risk further value erosion.
