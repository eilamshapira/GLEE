"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage. Since I face 5% inflation per round, I need to secure a good portion now, but I also want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept rather than reject and counter."
