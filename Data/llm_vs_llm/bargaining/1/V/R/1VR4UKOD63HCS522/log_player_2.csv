"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. The total amount is $1,000,000
2. I'm being offered $450,000 (45%)
3. Alice wants $550,000 (55%)
4. There's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds
5. This is a fairly reasonable split, close to 50-50
6. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it

While I could try to negotiate for a more even split, this offer is reasonably fair, and there's no guarantee that a better deal would be accepted by Alice in the next round. The difference of $100,000 might not be worth the risk of potential rejection in future negotiations.
