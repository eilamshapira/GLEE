999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 while I keep $999999. Given that your money declines 5% each round while mine stays constant, waiting only hurts your position. Accept this deal now and secure what little is better than risking even less in the future.",Alice,1,

55555.0,944445.0,"Hi Bob, I know you’re considering your prospects in the next round. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 where, due to inflation, every dollar you receive is worth 15% less. In that scenario you could secure nearly all of the pot—but its effective value would be only about $850000. With my offer in Round 3, your nominal share of $944445 is worth 10% less (i.e. approximately $850000 in Round 1 value), which is just as good without the delay. I believe this fair proposal benefits you as much as waiting would. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
