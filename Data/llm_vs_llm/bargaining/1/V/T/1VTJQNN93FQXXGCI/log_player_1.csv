"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 while I keep $999,999. Given that your money declines 5% each round while mine stays constant, waiting only hurts your position. Accept this deal now and secure what little is better than risking even less in the future.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose to split the money evenly. Each of us would get $500000. This way, we both secure a significant amount while avoiding losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55555, ""bob_gain"": 944445, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know you’re considering your prospects in the next round. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 where, due to inflation, every dollar you receive is worth 15% less. In that scenario you could secure nearly all of the pot—but its effective value would be only about $850,000. With my offer in Round 3, your nominal share of $944,445 is worth 10% less (i.e. approximately $850,000 in Round 1 value), which is just as good without the delay. I believe this fair proposal benefits you as much as waiting would. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"
