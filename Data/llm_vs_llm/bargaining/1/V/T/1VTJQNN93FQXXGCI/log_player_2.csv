"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 while I keep $999999. Given that your money declines 5% each round while mine stays constant, waiting only hurts your position. Accept this deal now and secure what little is better than risking even less in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,""alice_gain"": 500000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose to split the money evenly. Each of us would get $500,000. This way, we both secure a significant amount while avoiding losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know you’re considering your prospects in the next round. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 where, due to inflation, every dollar you receive is worth 15% less. In that scenario you could secure nearly all of the pot—but its effective value would be only about $850000. With my offer in Round 3, your nominal share of $944445 is worth 10% less (i.e. approximately $850000 in Round 1 value), which is just as good without the delay. I believe this fair proposal benefits you as much as waiting would. Let's settle now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 944445 
# Alice gain: 55555 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
