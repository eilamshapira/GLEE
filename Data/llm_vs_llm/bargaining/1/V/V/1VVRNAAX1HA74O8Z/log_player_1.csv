"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer to divide $10,000.

Given that there's inflation for Bob (his money is worth 10% less each round), I should propose something fair that also acknowledges this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round if we continue to negotiate, accepting this equal split now would be beneficial for him."
