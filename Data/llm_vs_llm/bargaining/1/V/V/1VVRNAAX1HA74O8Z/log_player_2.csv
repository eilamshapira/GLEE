"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Alice offers a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation factor:
- If I accept now, I get $5000
- If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
- So in the next round, $5000 would only be worth $4500 to me

Since any counteroffer I make in the next round would be worth less to me due to inflation, and 50-50 is a fair split, I should accept this offer.
