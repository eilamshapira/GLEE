"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the amount in a way where you get a little more to seal the deal quickly. Let's avoid the inflation hit! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $550,000 (55%) while taking $450,000 (45%). This is a favorable split in my favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means even if I could get a larger share next round, the $550,000 now would be worth more than $687,500 (which would be needed just to match the current value after 20% inflation).

Given:
1. The offer is already in my favor (55/45 split)
2. The significant inflation penalty makes waiting risky
3. Alice is being reasonable and cooperative
