"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $2,000 while she gets $8,000. That's a 20-80 split, which is quite uneven. 

If I reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, I'll be affected by 20% inflation, meaning any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me. However, I could potentially negotiate a much better split.

Let me reject this offer and make a more balanced counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, accounting for the fact that I've already experienced one round of inflation. I need to offer Alice enough to make it worth accepting, while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is fair and gives us both a significant amount. Since I've already experienced one round of inflation, my $5,000 will be worth $4,000 to me, but this is still better than the $2,000 initially offered. I hope Alice sees this as a reasonable and fair compromise."
