Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to reach an agreement and the money loses value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is significant, and I can make a better counter-offer. My $4500 would be worth even less due to the 10% inflation effect, making it effectively $4050. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With inflation affecting both of us, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you a fair 45-55 split that takes into account our time pressure. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation is affecting us both, but seemingly impacting your gain more, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. A 52.5-47.5 split is a more balanced compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With inflation reducing my purchasing power by 27.1%, further delays would significantly diminish the value of any future gains. This 47.5% share, while not ideal, is better than risking further devaluation through additional rounds of negotiation."
