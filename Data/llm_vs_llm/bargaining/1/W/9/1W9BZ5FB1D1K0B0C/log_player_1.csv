"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in our favor. Since time affects both of us negatively but affects Bob more severely (20% vs my 5% inflation per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly, though Bob has a stronger incentive to agree early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3, I need to consider that both of us are experiencing inflation, with Bob's being more significant.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my initial offer. Given the inflation rates (my 5% vs his 20%), it's rational for both of us to reach an agreement soon, and this split represents a fair compromise. For Bob, waiting another round would diminish his gains significantly due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
