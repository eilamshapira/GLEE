Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's have a fair split where I get a bit more as the first mover, and we both avoid losing money to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're now in round 2 and the value has decreased due to inflation, I propose a split where I get 55 and you get 45. This way, we both still get a reasonable amount despite the loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. Due to inflation, the $45 I would get now is worth $42.75 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 where the money will be worth even less
3. Getting $42.75 (in round 1 value) is better than risking further depreciation
4. The split is reasonably fair given the circumstances"
