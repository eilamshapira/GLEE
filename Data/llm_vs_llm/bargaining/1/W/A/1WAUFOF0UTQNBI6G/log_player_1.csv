"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000. Since I face 20% inflation per round, I need to be mindful of the value of making a deal now versus later.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that recognizes my need to secure a good deal now due to my inflation penalty, while still giving Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Due to inflation, if I reject and we go to another round, my share would be worth even less. With the current 20% inflation for me, accepting $500,000 now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. This is a fair compromise that gives us equal shares of the money."
