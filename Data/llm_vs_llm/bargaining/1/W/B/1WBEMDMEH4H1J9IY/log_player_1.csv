Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want to be fair, but considering the inflation that affects us both, I think it's reasonable for me to get a slight advantage here. Let's settle on this to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
