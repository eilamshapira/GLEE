60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's split it fairly, giving me a bit more to account for inflation since I'm going first. This is a good deal for both of us!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject, by the next round your money will devalue even further (down to 60% of its nominal value), and you'll face tougher terms. Accepting 10 now gives you an effective 8, which is better than the minimal payoff you'd secure in the next round. Let's finish this quickly to avoid further losses!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, my money is losing value faster than yours. Let's be reasonable. I'll take a bit less than the first offer, but this is a much fairer split considering the time value of money. This is a good deal for you!",Alice,3,
