"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject, by the next round your money will devalue even further (down to 60% of its nominal value), and you'll face tougher terms. Accepting 10 now gives you an effective 8, which is better than the minimal payoff you'd secure in the next round. Let's finish this quickly to avoid further losses! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
