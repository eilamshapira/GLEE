"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation rule.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, but not to Alice. So if I make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 would only be worth $80 to me.

Given that the current offer gives me $50 and is fair, I should accept it now rather than risk making a counter-offer when the total value to me has decreased.
