550000.0,450000.0,"Let's split it fairly. I'm offering $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a good offer for both of us, let's avoid inflation eating away our gains. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"I'm feeling bold, Alice. Let's go for 650000 for me and 350000 for you.  Time is money, and we're losing both with every passing round! ðŸ˜‰",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, your last offer was too greedy. My money is losing value. I'm proposing $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This accounts for the lost value to me. Let's stop the game here.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Okay, Alice, let's find a middle ground. How about we split the difference from our previous offers? 600000 for me and 400000 for you. It's a win-win before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is hurting me more than you seem to realize. I'm offering $575000. This is my best offer. Let's take it, or we both lose.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm serious about getting this done.  Let's split the difference again - 550000 for me and 450000 for you. That's more than you were offering me last round, and it avoids another round of inflation eating away at our potential gains.  Let's be smart and close this deal!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm going back to my original offer of $550000 for me. At this point, this is really losing money for me and this accounts for the lost value. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
