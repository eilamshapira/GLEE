"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm offering $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a good offer for both of us, let's avoid inflation eating away our gains. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, I'm willing to gamble that she might be more averse to inflation than I am.  I'll aim for a larger portion in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling bold, Alice. Let's go for 650,000 for me and 350,000 for you.  Time is money, and we're losing both with every passing round! ðŸ˜‰""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was too greedy. My money is losing value. I'm proposing $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This accounts for the lost value to me. Let's stop the game here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but her offer still doesn't favor me enough. I suspect she's overestimating her own risk tolerance. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's find a middle ground. How about we split the difference from our previous offers? 600,000 for me and 400,000 for you. It's a win-win before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is hurting me more than you seem to realize. I'm offering $575000. This is my best offer. Let's take it, or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to sell this as her ""best offer,"" but I still think I have leverage.  It's a risk, but I'm willing to gamble that she'll crack under the pressure of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting this done.  Let's split the difference again - 550,000 for me and 450,000 for you. That's more than you were offering me last round, and it avoids another round of inflation eating away at our potential gains.  Let's be smart and close this deal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm going back to my original offer of $550000 for me. At this point, this is really losing money for me and this accounts for the lost value. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is digging in her heels, and the inflation is starting to become a serious concern.  It's better to take a slightly smaller portion now than risk getting even less later on, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
