"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,500 from my perspective).

This first offer seems a bit low since it's below a 50-50 split. Since we have many rounds left and only a 5% penalty per round, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 60-40 split in her favor, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving her a decent portion to increase chances of acceptance. A 55-45 split in my favor seems reasonable, considering I need to account for potential future inflation if she rejects.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, I get slightly more than half while still leaving Alice with a significant portion. This is more equitable than her initial offer, and if she rejects, she'll have to consider that the money will be worth less in the next round due to inflation (at least for me)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,500 for me
2. Due to inflation, this $4,500 is actually worth only $4,063.88 to me (4500 * 0.9025)
3. We still have 9 rounds left, but each round makes the money worth less to me
4. Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, moving from a 60-40 split to a 55-45 split
5. The inflation affects only my gains, putting me at a disadvantage if this continues for many rounds

While I might be able to get a slightly better deal, the inflation risk is significant. This is a reasonable offer considering the asymmetric inflation effect, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise.
