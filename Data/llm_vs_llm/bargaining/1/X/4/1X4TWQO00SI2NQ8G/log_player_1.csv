"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start our negotiation, considering the inflation risk for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the million dollars evenly, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests, and avoids the 20% loss from inflation if we need to go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm receiving slightly less than my initial proposal, the 20% inflation penalty makes this a reasonable compromise. If I reject and we go to round 3, the total value would decrease further, potentially leaving both of us worse off. $450,000 now is better than risking further negotiations with continued value loss."
