# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push for a better deal still. While the offer is better than the first, waiting another round to see if I can improve my take is worth the risk with the current inflation rate."

This is getting tight.  Alice is moving in the right direction, but I think I can squeeze a little more out of this deal with a couple more rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try to find a middle ground here. How about $410000 for me and $590000 for you? We're both losing value with each round. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 590000 
# Alice gain: 410000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting too risky now.  While I'd prefer a higher percentage, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable win before inflation eats away more of the potential gains."
