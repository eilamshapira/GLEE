"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the inflation affecting my share, this offer balances fairness with the need to mitigate my losses. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation
   * Actual value for me = $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to compounding inflation
   * Even if I proposed a better split, the inflation would significantly reduce my gains
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer

3. Bob's current offer is reasonable:
   * The 55-45 split is not too far from my initial proposal
   * Delaying further would hurt my position more due to higher inflation impact on my side

Given these factors, especially the asymmetric inflation that affects me more severely, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
