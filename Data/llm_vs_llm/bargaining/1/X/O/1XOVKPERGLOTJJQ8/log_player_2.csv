"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000. While I'd receive a substantial amount, it's not an even split.

Since this is just the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I believe I can propose a more equitable division if I reject this offer. If I reject, I'll get to make the next proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair, even split with a friendly message.

""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. We both walk away with half a million dollars.""}"
