"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both want the deal to happen. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I've adjusted my offer to be more appealing to Bob, as time is a factor now. However, I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the inflation working against me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss of value, but still giving you a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is getting closer to acceptable, but the rate of inflation means I need to push for a bit more now or accept a much worse deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is practically a steal for you now!  I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, let's be reasonable and wrap this up.""
}
``` 

I'm holding firm on my previous offer amount, but emphasizing how much the inflation is impacting me.  It's a risky move, but the next round will be even worse if he rejects it."
