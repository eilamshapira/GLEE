"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice offering me $40 and keeping $60, this isn't a terrible offer, but I could potentially get more. However, I need to consider that if I reject:
1. I'll have to make the next offer
2. The money will be worth 5% less due to inflation (so $100 becomes $95 in total value)
3. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more inflation

At $40, I'm getting 40% of the pot. If I reject and go to the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $42.11 (40/0.95) to make up for the inflation loss.

Given these considerations, while the offer isn't great, the risk of losing value through inflation makes it reasonable enough to accept.
