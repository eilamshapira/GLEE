"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. Since I want to maximize my gain while making it attractive enough for Bob to accept, I'll offer a reasonable but slightly favorable split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects it, in the next round the total value will be worth 10% less to me, so I need to secure a good portion now. However, I'm offering Bob a substantial amount to make it worth accepting rather than continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept this offer now, I get $4000, but it's worth 10% less to me due to inflation, so effectively $3600
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
- To beat $3600 in round 3, I would need to get more than $4500, and Bob would need to accept that offer
- Given Bob's demonstrated preference for a larger share, getting them to accept a better deal for me seems unlikely
