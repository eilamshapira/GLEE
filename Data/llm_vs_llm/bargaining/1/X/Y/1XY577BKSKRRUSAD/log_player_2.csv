"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer, we'll go to round 2 where I can make a proposal. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. So if I were to get $5,000 in round 2, it would effectively be worth only $4,000 to me due to the 20% inflation.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting a fair split now is better than potentially getting a similar or even slightly better offer in a future round where inflation has reduced the value.
