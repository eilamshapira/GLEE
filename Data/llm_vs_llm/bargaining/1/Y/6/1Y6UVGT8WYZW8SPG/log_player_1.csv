I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing an agreement. Bob rejected my initial offer, indicating he likely wants at least a 50/50 split. However, I know the value of the money decreases for me each round.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, but still more advantageous to me than accepting a 50/50 split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, but if I reject it, the value of the money decreases even further for me. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking an even worse outcome in the next round."
