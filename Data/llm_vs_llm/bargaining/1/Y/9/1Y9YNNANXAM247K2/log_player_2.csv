"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $48.72 while taking $51.28
2. It's fairly close to a 50-50 split
3. If I reject, the total amount will be worth 5% less next round ($95)
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, the absolute amount I could get might be lower due to the 5% depreciation

Since the offer is reasonably fair and the risk of losing value through inflation is significant, I'll accept.
