550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (5%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This way, we can both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation of the money.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation rates, it's a fair starting point for further negotiations if needed.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be strategic here. Your money devalues 20% each round while mine only 5%. At this point, your 400000 in this round is worth more than 500000 would be worth after several more rounds of negotiation. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,

580000.0,420000.0,"Given the significant difference in how our shares devalue, I'm making a compromise. This offer reflects a balance between the current value of the money for both of us and the potential for future negotiations.",Bob,4,
