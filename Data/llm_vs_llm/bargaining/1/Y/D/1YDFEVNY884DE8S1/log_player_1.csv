"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (5%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This way, we can both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation of the money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation rates, it's a fair starting point for further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The even split doesn't account for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), waiting another round affects him more than me. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic here. Your money devalues 20% each round while mine only 5%. At this point, your 400,000 in this round is worth more than 500,000 would be worth after several more rounds of negotiation. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant difference in how our shares devalue, I'm making a compromise. This offer reflects a balance between the current value of the money for both of us and the potential for future negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering our different inflation rates. Bob has recognized the impact of the higher devaluation rate on his share, and this split fairly accounts for our different situations. It's better to accept now than risk further devaluation for both parties."
