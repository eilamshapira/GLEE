"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty I face in each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

Alice is offering me $500,000 now. If I reject and try to get more next round, I'd need to secure more than $526,315 (which is $500,000 รท 0.95) to come out ahead.

Given that Alice might reject my counter-offer and we'd continue to additional rounds with further inflation for me, accepting a fair 50-50 split now seems reasonable.
