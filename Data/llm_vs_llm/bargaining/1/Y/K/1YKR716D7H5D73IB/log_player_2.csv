"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money equally. How does 5000 each sound? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With 20% inflation per round, if I reject now and propose in the next round, the $5000 would only be worth $4000 to me. Each subsequent round would reduce the value further.

Alice is offering a perfectly equal split right at the start, which would give me $5000 at full value. This is actually quite reasonable given that I'm at a disadvantage with the inflation penalty.

If I reject, I risk getting a worse deal in later rounds due to inflation, and Alice might become less cooperative after a rejection of a fair offer.
