"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair start, let's keep it simple. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $30 while taking $70
2. If I reject, the next round will have a 10% inflation penalty for me
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
4. My $30 now is worth more than $30 in future rounds
5. However, this split heavily favors Alice (70-30)

Given that there are many rounds left and the initial offer is quite unfavorable to me, I'll reject this and make a counter-proposal. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should be able to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by inflation. This way we can both walk away with a fair share and avoid lengthy negotiations that would hurt my value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm adjusting my offer to reflect your concerns. Let's both get something fair. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice has increased her offer from $30 to $35
2. Due to 19% inflation, my $35 is actually worth about $28.35 in round 1 terms
3. Alice still keeps a significant majority ($65)
4. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (29%)
5. While I could make another counter-offer, the inflation is starting to seriously impact my potential gains

This offer is actually worse for me than the first offer when accounting for inflation. I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal despite the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges the growing inflation pressure while still aiming for fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Due to 29% inflation on my end, this split is actually more balanced than it appears. My $60 is worth only about $42.60 in round 1 terms, while your $40 maintains full value. Let's agree and avoid further value loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a better deal this time. Let's ensure we both get something valuable before inflation cuts further into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice has increased her offer to $40
2. With 34.39% inflation, my $40 is actually worth about $26.24 in round 1 terms
3. The inflation is becoming a serious problem
4. We've gone through 5 rounds already, and the trend suggests Alice is slowly increasing her offers
5. But each increase is being more than offset by inflation
6. If I reject, we'll face 44.39% inflation in the next round

Given that the inflation is severely eroding my potential gains and Alice seems willing to negotiate but very gradually, I should accept this offer before it gets worse. Further negotiations might lead to higher nominal amounts but even lower real value for me.
