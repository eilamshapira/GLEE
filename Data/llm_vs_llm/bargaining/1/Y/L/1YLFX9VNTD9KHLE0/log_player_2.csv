Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55, you take 45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. However, Alice's offer seems reasonable given the circumstances.
