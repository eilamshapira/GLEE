550000.0,450000.0,Let's make this fair and efficient. I suggest a 55-45 split to account for the higher inflation impact on my side. This way we both walk away with a good amount without risking value loss through multiple rounds.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your rate of inflation is much higher than mine.  I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I also need to protect my own interests. This offer is fair considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. This 60-40 split compensates for the difference in our inflation rates and helps us both walk away with good value. Further delays will hurt us both, but me more significantly.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your position on inflation, but this offer is a compromise. It gives you a larger share than my last offer while still acknowledging the value decrease for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about the mathematics. I'm already losing 48.8% to inflation while you're only losing 14.26%. At this rate, we're both losing value with each round. This 65-35 split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further negotiation will only hurt us both more.",Alice,5,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Your share in this offer reflects the impact of inflation, but it also acknowledges that we both lose with continued delays.  Let's settle this now before the money shrinks even further.",Bob,6,
