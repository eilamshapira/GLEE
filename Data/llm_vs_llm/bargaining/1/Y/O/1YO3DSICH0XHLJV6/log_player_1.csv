"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I suggest a 55-45 split to account for the higher inflation impact on my side. This way we both walk away with a good amount without risking value loss through multiple rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your rate of inflation is much higher than mine.  I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I also need to protect my own interests. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): The offer is too low given my higher inflation rate. Even with one round of inflation, I would still be better off making a counter-proposal. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, we can negotiate further, but there's still plenty of time with 10 rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. This 60-40 split compensates for the difference in our inflation rates and helps us both walk away with good value. Further delays will hurt us both, but me more significantly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on inflation, but this offer is a compromise. It gives you a larger share than my last offer while still acknowledging the value decrease for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): While Bob has improved his offer, it's still not adequate given the significant difference in our inflation rates. At this point, I'm losing almost 50% to inflation while Bob is only losing about 14%. We still have 8 rounds left, and I need to push for a better split to compensate for my higher inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about the mathematics. I'm already losing 48.8% to inflation while you're only losing 14.26%. At this rate, we're both losing value with each round. This 65-35 split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further negotiation will only hurt us both more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Your share in this offer reflects the impact of inflation, but it also acknowledges that we both lose with continued delays.  Let's settle this now before the money shrinks even further. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): While this isn't the ideal split, the compounding inflation effect is becoming severe. With my share already worth 67.23% less, my real value from this $480,000 is about $157,296. If I reject and we continue negotiating, even a larger nominal amount in future rounds could result in less real value due to the 20% per round inflation on my side. Bob has moved significantly from his initial position, and further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us."
