"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I suggest a 55-45 split to account for the higher inflation impact on my side. This way we both walk away with a good amount without risking value loss through multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2

 ""bob_gain"": 600000,
 ""alice_gain"": 400000,
 ""message"": ""Alice, your rate of inflation is much higher than mine.  I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I also need to protect my own interests. This offer is fair considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. This 60-40 split compensates for the difference in our inflation rates and helps us both walk away with good value. Further delays will hurt us both, but me more significantly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic about the mathematics. I'm already losing 48.8% to inflation while you're only losing 14.26%. At this rate, we're both losing value with each round. This 65-35 split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further negotiation will only hurt us both more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
