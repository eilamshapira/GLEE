"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair for me. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and move to the next round, I can make my own offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

Since $400,000 is reasonably substantial, and waiting would decrease the value for me due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
