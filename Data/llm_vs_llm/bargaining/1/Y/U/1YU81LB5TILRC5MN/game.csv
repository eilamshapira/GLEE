60.0,40.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation, and you have a higher inflation rate than me.",Alice,1,

95.0,5.0,"Alice, further rounds will mean bigger losses for both of us – especially for me. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all the money (discounted only by 5% per round), so I’m offering you $95 now, which matches your expected value if you delay. Let’s avoid further inflation harm and agree on this split.",Bob,2,
