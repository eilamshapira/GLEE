"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation, and you have a higher inflation rate than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further rounds will mean bigger losses for both of us – especially for me. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all the money (discounted only by 5% per round), so I’m offering you $95 now, which matches your expected value if you delay. Let’s avoid further inflation harm and agree on this split. 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is clear: Bob's offer of $95 is excellent for me. If I reject and wait for round 3 to make my own proposal, my gains would be impacted by 10% inflation (two rounds of 5%), and Bob might still reject. Additionally, Bob's analysis is correct - this matches approximately what I could expect to get in later rounds, but without the risk of further inflation losses. It's a rational offer that acknowledges the game dynamics and inflation pressures, particularly Bob's higher inflation rate of 20% per round."
