"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation, and you have a higher inflation rate than me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5, ""alice_gain"": 95, ""message"": ""Alice, further rounds will mean bigger losses for both of us – especially for me. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all the money (discounted only by 5% per round), so I’m offering you $95 now, which matches your expected value if you delay. Let’s avoid further inflation harm and agree on this split.""}"
