"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose this split because it's close enough to 50-50 to be reasonable, while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be worth 5% less to me, so this is a fair first offer."
