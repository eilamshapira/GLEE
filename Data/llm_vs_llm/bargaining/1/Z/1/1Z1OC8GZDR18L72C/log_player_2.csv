Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Before making an offer, I want to calculate the actual value of the money for both players after accounting for inflation.

For Bob (me), the money is worth 10% less with each passing round. So, the value of the money for Bob in round 4 is:
\( 10,000 \times (1 - 0.10)^3 = 10,000 \times 0.729 = 7,290 \)

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less with each passing round. So, the value of the money for Alice in round 4 is:
\( 10,000 \times (1 - 0.20)^3 = 10,000 \times 0.512 = 5,120 \)

Given these values, let's make an offer that considers the devalued amounts.
