"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Considering the rapid inflation affecting my gains, I will make a relatively aggressive opening offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will evaluate Bob's offer, keeping inflation in mind. My money is now worth 20% less, and Bob's is worth 10% less.

Bob is offering $5000. While a seemingly even split, the inflation is hurting me more. I will reject and hope to get a slightly better offer next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Inflation continues to erode the value of the money for me. I'll try to be more reasonable this round, but still prioritizing my gains given the circumstances. The money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, and the money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering $4500. I need to consider that my money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round and Bob's is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. This translates to Bob getting proportionally more ""real"" value. I am concerned about the rapidly approaching deadline and continuous value decrease. I'm going to accept this offer.
