"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we reverse the split and make it 70/30 in my favor this round? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 300,000 * 0.9 = $270,000.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 10% less than in Round 2, which was already 10% less than the original value. So, the effective value is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value. For Bob, it's worth 20% less than in Round 2, which was already 20% less than the original value. So, the effective value is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 65/35 is a fair split considering the inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about an even 60/40 split? With inflation, we should settle before losing more value! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 400,000 * 0.729 = $291,600.

I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'm also not convinced that this is the best I can do. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 27.1% less than in Round 1, and it will continue to decrease. For Bob, it's worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, which is a significant decrease.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's settle on a 55/45 split, it's getting risky to wait further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise with a 55/45 split favoring me, to avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 40.95% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 450,000 * 0.5905 = $265,725.

I think this is a relatively reasonable offer, and the inflation is really starting to eat into the value. I don't want to risk losing even more value by waiting.
