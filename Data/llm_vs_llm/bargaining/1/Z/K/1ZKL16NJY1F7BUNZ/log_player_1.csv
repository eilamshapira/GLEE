"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that is fair but accounts for our different sensitivity to inflation.

Since I (Alice) face a higher inflation rate (10% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner, and I should acknowledge this position in my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion while slightly favoring me as the first mover. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests and avoids unnecessary delays that would hurt us both, but me more severely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty means that delaying further would significantly reduce the value of any future gains for me. The $4,800 now is better than risking another round of the 10% inflation that affects me more severely than Bob."
