"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. This is not an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation penalties for rejecting.

If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I would make a counteroffer
- My money would be worth 5% less
- Alice's money would be worth 10% less

This means if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, Alice has a stronger incentive to accept due to her higher inflation penalty.

Given the inflation asymmetry and the fact that Alice's initial offer gives me a substantial portion (45%), I should carefully consider whether rejecting is worth it.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I've rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counteroffer that accounts for our different inflation penalties. 

Alice faces a higher inflation penalty (10% per round) than I do (5% per round), which gives me some negotiating advantage. However, I should still make a reasonable offer that Alice would accept to avoid further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,200 and Alice receives $4,800. This is better for me than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than face another round of 10% inflation on her portion."
