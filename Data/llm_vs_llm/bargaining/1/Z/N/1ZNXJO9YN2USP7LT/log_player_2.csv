"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable split. This gives us both a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing it all if we go too many rounds with inflation. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting a bit more to account for the potential impact of inflation on me as we proceed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 60/40 split, giving me $4,000 and her $6,000.

With 10% inflation per round for me, waiting even one round means the total value decreases to $9,000 from my perspective. If I make a counter-offer next round, I'd need to get at least $4,445 ($4,000 รท 0.9) to break even compared to accepting now.

While a 50/50 split might seem more fair initially, the inflation risk and possibility of getting nothing after 12 rounds makes the current offer reasonable. Taking $4,000 now is better than risking further rounds where the money's value diminishes for me.
