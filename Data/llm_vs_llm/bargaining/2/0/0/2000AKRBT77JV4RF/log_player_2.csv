"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice
   - I can make my own proposal
   - Value to me next round: $900,000 maximum (1,000,000 * 0.9)

A 60/40 split in Alice's favor isn't particularly fair when we're starting fresh. Since I can make a counter-offer next round and the penalty affects Alice less than me, I could potentially negotiate a better deal despite the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice knows that:
1. Money depreciates faster for me (10%) than for her (5%)
2. If she rejects, her next offer would be worth less to both of us

I should propose a fair split that's attractive enough for her to accept, considering these factors.
