"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 99.9% and you get 0.1%.  We can call it a day, or we can risk inflation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I don't know how Alice is affected by inflation, there's no way I'm accepting such a small amount on the first round.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more reasonable starting point, Alice. 70/30 split. Consider the inflation we face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split 80/20.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While it's a better offer, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  It seems she's not as affected by inflation as I am, making her more willing to drag this out. I need to push for a more significant share before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back-and-forth helps no one. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""}"
