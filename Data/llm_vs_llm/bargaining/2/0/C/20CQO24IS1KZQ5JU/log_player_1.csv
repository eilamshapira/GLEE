"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to secure a good outcome for myself, but I also need to make an offer Bob is likely to accept to avoid losing everything. Given this is the first round, I'll start with a somewhat aggressive, but hopefully still acceptable, offer.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer. To avoid further rounds and the risk of losing everything, I will accept.
