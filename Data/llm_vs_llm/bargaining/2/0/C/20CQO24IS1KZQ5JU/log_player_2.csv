"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically here. Alice is offering $400,000 to me and $600,000 to herself, which gives me 40% of the total. Since we have 12 rounds, I have room to negotiate for a better split.

If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round. Given that we both get nothing if we don't reach an agreement by round 12, there's an incentive to find a fair division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that's closer to an even split, while still giving Alice a reasonable amount.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which is the fairest division between us."
