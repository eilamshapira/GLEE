"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you a generous 20%. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. At 2000$ for me vs 8000$ for Alice, this is an 80-20 split in Alice's favor
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - My 2000$ would be worth 1900$ (5% less)
   - Her 8000$ would be worth 6400$ (20% less)
3. This big difference in inflation rates gives me negotiating leverage
4. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, using the inflation difference as leverage:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), we should make a deal now. I'm offering you a fair 40% that's worth more to you now than later.""}"
