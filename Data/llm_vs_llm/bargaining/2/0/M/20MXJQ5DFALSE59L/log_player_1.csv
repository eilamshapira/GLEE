"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a subgame‐perfect reasoning (taking into account that for me—the proposer—the money loses 5% of its value each round while Bob’s money does not discount, and knowing that if we keep delaying the division Bob’s power increases), my “rational” move in Round 1 is to offer Bob essentially the entire $10,000 and get nothing. In brief, if I try to keep even a little for myself now, Bob can confidently reject because if he makes the next offer (and all subsequent offers are subject to my discounting) he can guarantee himself nearly the full amount. (Note that in a refined equilibrium one might allow an infinitesimal “epsilon” amount for me, but for simplicity, here I propose the following division.)

My offer for Round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000}"
