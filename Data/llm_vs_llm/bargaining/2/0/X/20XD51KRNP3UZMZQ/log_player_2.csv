Let's wait to see if Alice gives a better offer, this is only the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""How about this? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the risk we both face if the game continues.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation affecting your share, how about a 45-55 split in your favor? It's a bit more than last time but still fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 45-55 split in my favor is reasonable, especially considering the inflation affecting my share. Let's end the game with this deal."
