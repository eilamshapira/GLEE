600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, how about we settle immediately to avoid further devaluation? I'm proposing $600K for me and $400K for you. The extra weight on my side reflects the looming 20% inflation hit on my portion in later rounds. Let's agree now to secure as much value as possible for both of us.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I don't actually face any inflation penalty (0% inflation for me according to the rules), I can propose a more balanced split. I'm offering you $450000 and $550000 for me. This is more equitable than your initial proposal, and we still have plenty of rounds to reach an agreement before any potential devaluation affects either of us.",Bob,2,
