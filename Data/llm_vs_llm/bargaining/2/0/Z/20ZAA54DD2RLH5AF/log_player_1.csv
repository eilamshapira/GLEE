"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, how about we settle immediately to avoid further devaluation? I'm proposing $600K for me and $400K for you. The extra weight on my side reflects the looming 20% inflation hit on my portion in later rounds. Let's agree now to secure as much value as possible for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I don't actually face any inflation penalty (0% inflation for me according to the rules), I can propose a more balanced split. I'm offering you $450000 and $550000 for me. This is more equitable than your initial proposal, and we still have plenty of rounds to reach an agreement before any potential devaluation affects either of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
