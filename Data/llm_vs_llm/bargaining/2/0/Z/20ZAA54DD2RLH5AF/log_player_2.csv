"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, how about we settle immediately to avoid further devaluation? I'm proposing $600K for me and $400K for you. The extra weight on my side reflects the looming 20% inflation hit on my portion in later rounds. Let's agree now to secure as much value as possible for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000, claiming she faces inflation in later rounds.

However, according to the rules, the money loses 0% value for me with each round - meaning there's actually no inflation penalty for me to continue negotiating. Since there's no cost to me for continuing to the next round where I can make an offer, and we have plenty of rounds remaining, I should try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I don't actually face any inflation penalty (0% inflation for me according to the rules), I can propose a more balanced split. I'm offering you $450,000 and $550,000 for me. This is more equitable than your initial proposal, and we still have plenty of rounds to reach an agreement before any potential devaluation affects either of us.""}"
