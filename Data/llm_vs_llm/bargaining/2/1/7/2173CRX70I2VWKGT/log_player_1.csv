"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself, but still offering Bob a substantial portion. Since Bob faces a higher inflation penalty (20% per round compared to my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my new offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal, considering the inflation penalties we both face. Since Bob's inflation penalty is significantly higher at 20% per round (compared to my 5%), reaching an agreement quickly is especially important for him. This offer gives Bob a better deal while still being fair to me."
