"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the inflation rates for both me and Alice.

Given that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and 5% less for Alice, I should evaluate if accepting $4500 now is better than potentially getting more in a future round, considering the decreasing value.

However, since this is the first round, the full value of the money is still intact. I need to think about the strategic aspect of the game as well. If I reject this offer, I will have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the value of the money will decrease for both of us.

Considering Alice's initial offer gives her $5500 and me $4500, it seems somewhat unfair, as it doesn't split the money evenly. But, given the rules of the game and the fact that I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer if I reject, I should think strategically about my next move.

Given the significant decrease in value for me (20%) compared to Alice (5%) per round, it might be beneficial to try to secure a deal early on to avoid losing too much value in subsequent rounds. However, this first offer does not seem particularly generous.

For now, I will reject this offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and this is only the second round, I haven't lost too much value yet. However, I need to be mindful of this significant decrease. For Alice, the money is worth 5% less, which is a more gradual decrease.

To make a fair and strategic offer, I'll aim for a split that is closer to even but also considers the potential future value decreases. An even split would be $5000 each, but given that Alice made an offer that favored her in Round 1, I might try to make an offer that slightly favors me to compensate for the risk of future rounds and the higher inflation rate I'm facing.

However, making an offer that is too biased towards me might lead to Alice rejecting it, which would cause both of us to lose value in the next round. So, I'll make an offer that is somewhat in the middle but still slightly favorable to me, considering my higher risk due to the inflation rate.

Let's propose a split where I get $5250 and Alice gets $4750. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than an even split but still within a reasonable range for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, and now we're in Round 3 with her making a new proposal, I need to carefully consider the current value of the money and the implications of accepting or rejecting this offer.

The key information here is the effect of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. For me, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. This means that the $4800 offered to me in this round is equivalent to $4800 / (1 - 0.36) = $4800 / 0.64 = $7500 in the first round's value, but because of the inflation, its actual value to me is $4800. For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less, which is a much more gradual decrease.

Alice's offer gives me $4800 and her $5200. Considering the inflation, if I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value of the money would decrease further for both of us, but more significantly for me.

Given the substantial decrease in value for me and the fact that Alice's offer, although not perfectly even, does provide a significant amount considering the circumstances, I should weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus risking further value decrease.

Accepting this offer would give me $4800, which, despite being less than half of the original $10,000, represents a better outcome than potentially getting nothing or a significantly reduced amount in later rounds due to the high inflation rate affecting me.

Therefore, considering the strategic aspect and the impact of inflation, I decide to accept Alice's offer in Round 3.
