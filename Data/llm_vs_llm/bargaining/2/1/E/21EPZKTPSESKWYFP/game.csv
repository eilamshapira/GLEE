6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it fairly! 60/40 seems reasonable considering we both need to walk away with something substantial, and the inflation will hit me hard later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation hits you harder, I'm willing to give you a bit less than half for now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, since you acknowledged the inflation hitting me harder, I'm proposing 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This still gives you a good amount, and I really need to account for the future devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I'm willing to take a bit more risk.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I understand you want more, but the inflation is becoming a serious issue for me. Let's be realistic and settle on 5300 for me and 4700 for you. This gives you almost half, and I get a slightly bigger chunk to compensate for the rapidly decreasing value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I know the inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm not feeling the same pressure. I'm willing to take a firmer stance and offer you 40% of the total amount. It's still a substantial sum, and I think it's a fair trade considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the inflation is killing me! I need at least 5100 to make this worth my while. Let's just agree on 5100 for me and 4900 for you and be done with this. Think of it as a small price to pay to avoid losing everything!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"I understand the inflation is severely impacting your potential gain, but I'm not willing to give up my advantage. I'll offer you 38% of the total amount, which is still a significant sum considering the circumstances. It's time to make a decision, as we're running out of rounds.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're almost out of time, and the inflation is destroying my potential gains. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, or we both get nothing!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I know the inflation is crippling your potential gain, but I'm not willing to give up my advantage. I'll offer you 35% of the total amount, which is still better than walking away with nothing. It's time to make a decision, as we're almost out of rounds.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire! I'm offering 4900, leaving you with 5100. This is the best I can do given the insane inflation. Please, let's not lose everything over this. Just accept!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"This is the final round, and I'm not willing to compromise. I'll offer you 30% of the total amount, which is still better than walking away with nothing. If you reject, we both lose everything. The decision is yours.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
