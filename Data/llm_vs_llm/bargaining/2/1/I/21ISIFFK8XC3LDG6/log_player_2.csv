"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice would need to accept less than $500,000 to make it worthwhile for her
4. Given that her money also devalues (by 5%), she might be reluctant to accept a significantly lower amount
5. $500,000 now is better than a risky attempt to get more in the next round with guaranteed depreciation

This is a fair offer, and the risk of depreciation makes it unwise to reject.
