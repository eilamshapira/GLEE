45.0,55.0,"Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than it affects me (10% per round), we should finalize this quickly. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to your higher inflation rate. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
