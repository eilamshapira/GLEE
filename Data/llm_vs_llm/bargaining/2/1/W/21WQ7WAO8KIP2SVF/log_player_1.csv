"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than it affects me (10% per round), we should finalize this quickly. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to your higher inflation rate. This is fair considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
