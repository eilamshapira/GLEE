"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I get a bit more to account for inflation later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","While I understand Alice's point about inflation, I need to consider what's best for me. The offer is not particularly favorable to me, given that inflation affects me less (10% per round) than it affects Alice (20% per round). If we play further rounds, I'll get the next proposal opportunity, which gives me an advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than it affects me (10% per round), we should finalize this quickly. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to your higher inflation rate. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
