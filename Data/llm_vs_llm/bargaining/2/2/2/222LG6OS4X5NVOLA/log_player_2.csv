"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally before inflation affects us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has proposed an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give each of us $500,000. This is a fair and equitable division that would allow us both to walk away with significant value.

If I reject this offer, I could potentially propose a division more favorable to myself in the next round. However, with the 5% inflation penalty per round, the total value would decrease to $950,000 in round 2. This means even if I got a larger percentage, we'd be dividing a smaller pie.

A fair equal split in round 1 maximizes our collective outcome, and there's no guarantee that future negotiations would yield me a significantly better result to offset the inflation loss.
