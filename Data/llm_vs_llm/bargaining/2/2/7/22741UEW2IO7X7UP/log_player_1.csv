"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alright Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. Let's make this quick before inflation eats away at our money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $50 is worth $45 (10% less)
2. If I reject and we continue, any future money will be worth even less
3. A 50-50 split is quite fair, and the longer we negotiate, the more we both lose
4. Bob seems reasonable and willing to cooperate
