"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split of $50 each, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the effects of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation will make this a better deal for you in the long run. Let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $45 offered to me is equivalent to $45 / 0.9 = $50 in the previous round. However, this is still less than the $50 I initially proposed.

Given that Bob's gain is worth 20% less, he's essentially getting $55 * 0.8 = $44 in value, which is a relatively worse deal for him compared to my initial proposal.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or forcing Bob to accept a more favorable split later on.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effects, I'll make a new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I've already lost 10% + 10% = 19% of the value in the first two rounds (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.19). To compensate for this loss, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into our shares, let's settle before it's too late""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of $52 for me and $48 for Bob, hoping he'll accept to avoid further inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me harder. This is still a good deal for you, considering the shrinking value. 
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, the $46 offered to me is equivalent to $46 / 0.729 = $63.10 in the previous round. This seems like a relatively good deal for me, given the shrinking value.

On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so the $54 he's offering himself is equivalent to $54 * 0.512 = $27.63 in the first round. This is a significant reduction in value for him.

Given the substantial loss in value for Bob and the relatively better deal for me, I'll accept this offer to secure a favorable share before the inflation eats away more value.
