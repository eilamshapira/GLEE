4500.0,5500.0,"I understand that you want a fair split, but considering the inflation rate is higher for you, it's beneficial for you to accept a slightly lower offer now. Next round, the money will be worth even less for you.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation affecting me more, but that's precisely why I need a slightly better deal to compensate. At this stage, my $5200 is already worth only $4160 to me (after 20% inflation), while your $4800 is worth $4560 to you (after 5% inflation). This is actually quite fair considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will hurt both of us.",Alice,3,
