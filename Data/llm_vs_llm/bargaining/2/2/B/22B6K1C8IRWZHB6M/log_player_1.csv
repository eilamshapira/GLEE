"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both get the maximum value since inflation will reduce our gains in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want a fair split, but considering the inflation rate is higher for you, it's beneficial for you to accept a slightly lower offer now. Next round, the money will be worth even less for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation affecting me more, but that's precisely why I need a slightly better deal to compensate. At this stage, my $5200 is already worth only $4160 to me (after 20% inflation), while your $4800 is worth $4560 to you (after 5% inflation). This is actually quite fair considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will hurt both of us.""
