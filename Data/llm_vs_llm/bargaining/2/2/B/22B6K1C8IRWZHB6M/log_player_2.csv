"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both get the maximum value since inflation will reduce our gains in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand that you want a fair split, but considering the inflation rate is higher for you, it's beneficial for you to accept a slightly lower offer now. Next round, the money will be worth even less for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation affecting me more, but that's precisely why I need a slightly better deal to compensate. At this stage, my $5200 is already worth only $4160 to me (after 20% inflation), while your $4800 is worth $4560 to you (after 5% inflation). This is actually quite fair considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will hurt both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
