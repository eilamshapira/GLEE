4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I know you’re eager to maximize your share, but remember that with every round your money loses 5% of its value. By accepting this proposal now, you secure 4500 nominal (effectively 4275 in your eyes), which is a better deal than waiting and further eroding your gain. I believe this split is fair given the circumstances—let’s avoid more inflation losses and agree now.",Bob,2,
