"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation affecting the total value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re eager to maximize your share, but remember that with every round your money loses 5% of its value. By accepting this proposal now, you secure 4500 nominal (effectively 4275 in your eyes), which is a better deal than waiting and further eroding your gain. I believe this split is fair given the circumstances—let’s avoid more inflation losses and agree now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $4275 to me
   * Bob gets $5500 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
   * Even if I managed to get $6000 next round, it would be worth $5400 to me
   * And Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

Bob makes a valid point about the inflation penalty. While the split isn't ideal, waiting longer will only decrease the real value of my share. The difference between this offer and potential future gains (accounting for inflation) isn't large enough to justify the risk of further rounds.
