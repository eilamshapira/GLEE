"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation affecting the total value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you’re eager to maximize your share, but remember that with every round your money loses 5% of its value. By accepting this proposal now, you secure 4500 nominal (effectively 4275 in your eyes), which is a better deal than waiting and further eroding your gain. I believe this split is fair given the circumstances—let’s avoid more inflation losses and agree now.""}"
