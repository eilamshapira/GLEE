"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though it's not an equal split, accepting is better than risking further inflation.  If I reject and propose a 60/40 split again in round 4, the value for me will be further diminished."
