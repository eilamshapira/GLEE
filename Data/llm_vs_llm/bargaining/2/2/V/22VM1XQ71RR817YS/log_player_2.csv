"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of 40$ to me and 60$ to her, or to reject and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

While Alice is proposing that I get 40% of the total amount, I could potentially propose a more equal split in the next round. Since fairness would suggest a 50-50 split, and I have the opportunity to make that counter-proposal, I think I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose an equal split which is the most fair division of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which seems most fair to both of us.""}"
