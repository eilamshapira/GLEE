"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 each. This is a fair and equitable division that reflects good faith negotiation and should be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $360,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- The difference between my initial offer (500k) and Bob's offer (450k) is relatively small
- Further negotiation rounds will consistently decrease my effective gains due to the high inflation rate affecting me
- Bob seems to be less affected by inflation (only 5%)

Given these factors, especially the harsh inflation penalty I face, it's better to accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
