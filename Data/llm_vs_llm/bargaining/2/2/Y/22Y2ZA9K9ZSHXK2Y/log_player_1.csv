"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable offer for myself, anticipating that Bob will likely want to negotiate. I hope he will accept, rather than risk further value loss in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's calculate the effective value of this offer considering inflation:

*   **Alice's perspective:** $500,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $450,000
*   **Bob's perspective:** $500,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $475,000

While I would have preferred more, $450,000 is still a significant amount. Given the risk of further inflation and Bob's seemingly fair split, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
