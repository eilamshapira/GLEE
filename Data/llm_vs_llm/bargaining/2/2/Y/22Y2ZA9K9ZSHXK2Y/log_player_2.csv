"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 and her $600,000. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me, meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me. I could potentially get a better share, but I need to consider if the potential gain outweighs the 5% loss in value.

I think I can propose a better division that Alice might accept, considering she faces a 10% depreciation if she rejects my next offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while being fair enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation if she rejects my offer (making the next round's $1M worth only $900K to her), while I face a 5% depreciation, this 50-50 split should be appealing to her. It gives her a better absolute value than she would likely get if we continued to another round."
