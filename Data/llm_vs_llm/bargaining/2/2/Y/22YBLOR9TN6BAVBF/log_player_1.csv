"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) compared to my rate (5% per round), I have some leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair opening offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Money will be worth another 5% less for me (90% total)
   * Money will be worth another 20% less for Bob (60% total)
   * I could make a better offer, but Bob might reject again

Given that:
- The current offer is relatively fair
- Further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us
- I'm getting close to what Bob would effectively receive
- The risk of further depreciation is substantial
