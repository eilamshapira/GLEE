"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me. Since it's the first round, and I don't know Bob's strategy, I'll try to be relatively fair while also accounting for the potential impact of inflation if we go multiple rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Fairness:** Starting with a relatively fair split (slightly in my favor) increases the likelihood of acceptance.
*   **Inflation Buffer:** I'm taking a little more initially to account for the potential 20% loss in value if we move to Round 2. If Bob rejects, I will need to offer him more.
*   **Uncertainty:** I don't know Bob's risk aversion or how he is impacted by inflation."
