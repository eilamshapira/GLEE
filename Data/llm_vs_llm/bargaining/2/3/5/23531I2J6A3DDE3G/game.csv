1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10000 now—I'll take $1000 and you get $9000. Given that the available amount dwindles by 10% each round, accepting this offer now is far better for both of us than delaying and ending up with significantly less. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,

,,"Bob, thank you for the offer. However, given that I will have the opportunity to propose in the next round—with the chance to secure a slightly higher share despite the inflation—I must reject your current proposal. I look forward to our continued negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob, to keep things moving and minimize further losses due to inflation, I propose the following for round 3: I take $1000 and you get $9000 (nominally). At this stage the total pie is effectively worth $8100 in today’s dollars, so your share comes to $9000 × 0.81 = $7290. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing a split on an even smaller pie (worth only $7290 overall), which won’t improve your position. I believe this offer matches your best alternative while ensuring we both avoid further devaluation. I hope we can agree to settle now.",Alice,3,
