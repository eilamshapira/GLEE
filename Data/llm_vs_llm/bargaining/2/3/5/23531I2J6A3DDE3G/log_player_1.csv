"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10,000 now—I'll take $1,000 and you get $9,000. Given that the available amount dwindles by 10% each round, accepting this offer now is far better for both of us than delaying and ending up with significantly less. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split it close to even. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing more value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thank you for the offer. However, given that I will have the opportunity to propose in the next round—with the chance to secure a slightly higher share despite the inflation—I must reject your current proposal. I look forward to our continued negotiation.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to keep things moving and minimize further losses due to inflation, I propose the following for round 3: I take $1,000 and you get $9,000 (nominally). At this stage the total pie is effectively worth $8,100 in today’s dollars, so your share comes to $9,000 × 0.81 = $7,290. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing a split on an even smaller pie (worth only $7,290 overall), which won’t improve your position. I believe this offer matches your best alternative while ensuring we both avoid further devaluation. I hope we can agree to settle now.""}"
