"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10000 now—I'll take $1000 and you get $9000. Given that the available amount dwindles by 10% each round, accepting this offer now is far better for both of us than delaying and ending up with significantly less. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split it close to even. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing more value in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to keep things moving and minimize further losses due to inflation, I propose the following for round 3: I take $1000 and you get $9000 (nominally). At this stage the total pie is effectively worth $8100 in today’s dollars, so your share comes to $9000 × 0.81 = $7290. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing a split on an even smaller pie (worth only $7290 overall), which won’t improve your position. I believe this offer matches your best alternative while ensuring we both avoid further devaluation. I hope we can agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000
