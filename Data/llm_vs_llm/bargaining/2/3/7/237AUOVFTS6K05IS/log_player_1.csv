"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer to Bob. Since we're starting the game and there's a 5% inflation penalty for each round, I want to propose a fair split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by resolving this in the first round."
