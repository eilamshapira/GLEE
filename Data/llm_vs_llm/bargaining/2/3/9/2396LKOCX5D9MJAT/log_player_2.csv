"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this fair split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you, considering my potential loss from inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about $5250 for me and $4750 for you? This considers my inflation costs while still being close to a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still skewed in her favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of significant disadvantage for me."

{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""I'm acknowledging the inflation impact. This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between our previous proposals.""}
