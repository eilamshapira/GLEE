I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm aiming for a fair split while still giving myself a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer by giving him slightly less. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I want to ensure I get a good portion of the remaining value."
