"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and make it a 55/45 split in your favor. This way, we both get a good deal before inflation hits us harder! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with some inflation, getting a slight majority of the money is a good deal for me at this stage. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting a worse offer later."
