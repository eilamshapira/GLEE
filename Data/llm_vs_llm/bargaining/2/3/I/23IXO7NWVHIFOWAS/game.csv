6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a reasonable offer considering the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the first round's offer and the looming inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as I'm giving you a chance to reconsider and still walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be practical and fair - a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. We're already losing value to inflation, and further negotiations will only hurt us both. This is a win-win offer.",Alice,3,
