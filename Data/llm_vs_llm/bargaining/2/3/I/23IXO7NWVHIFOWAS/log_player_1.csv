Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the first round's offer and the looming inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as I'm giving you a chance to reconsider and still walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
