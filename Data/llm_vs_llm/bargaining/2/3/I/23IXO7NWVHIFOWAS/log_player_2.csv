Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical and fair - a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. We're already losing value to inflation, and further negotiations will only hurt us both. This is a win-win offer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
