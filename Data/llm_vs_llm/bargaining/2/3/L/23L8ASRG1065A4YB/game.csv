34.48,65.52,Hi Bob – here’s my proposal. Considering our differing discount rates—your money losing only 5% per round and mine 10%—this division reflects our future bargaining positions. I’m offering me $34.48 and you $65.52. Accepting now maximizes our payoffs; delaying just diminishes both our returns. Looking forward to your agreement!,Alice,1,
