"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal. Considering our differing discount rates—your money losing only 5% per round and mine 10%—this division reflects our future bargaining positions. I’m offering me $34.48 and you $65.52. Accepting now maximizes our payoffs; delaying just diminishes both our returns. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48
