"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering that the money loses value for me by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while acknowledging that I should receive more given the inflation pressure I'm facing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob revealed his inflation rate in round 2 is only 10% per round, while mine is 20%. This means I have more pressure to reach an agreement sooner. Taking this into account, I'll modify my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a perfectly fair division. Since I face higher inflation penalties, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly, and this equal division should be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
