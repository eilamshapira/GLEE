"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation that affects me. I will propose a split that gives me a larger share initially to account for the future inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation effect. My potential gain of 450,000 in this round is worth 20% less than it would have been in Round 1. Bob's gain is worth 10% less than it would have been in Round 1.

To make a decision, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me and compare it to what I might expect to get in future rounds, keeping in mind further inflation.

The effective value of 450,000 to me now is 450000 * (1 - 0.20) = 360000

I have 10 rounds left. If I believe I can get more than 360000 (in equivalent round 1 dollars) in the future, I should reject. It's early in the game, so I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. I need to balance getting a good deal now with the risk of further inflation and potentially losing everything. Since Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his, it seems we both want a significant portion. I'll adjust my offer to be a bit more generous to Bob but still prioritize getting a good amount for myself given the inflation. I will consider that Bob might also be affected by inflation and I want to find a middle ground.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is still holding firm on his offer. The inflation is starting to bite. I need to carefully consider the value of this offer.

The effective value of 450,000 to me now is 450000 * (1 - 0.488) = 450000 * 0.512 = 230400

It is worth noting that Bob is losing more money than before by rejecting the offer, however the effect of inflation on him is much lower than on me, so I can't estimate the value he gives to the money correctly. I have 8 rounds left. I don't like the offer but I am afraid of the compounding inflation. I will reject one more time and propose a close-to-fair division to see if Bob will accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it is my turn to make an offer. I will make an offer that is slightly more fair than my previous offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
