"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I get 60, you get 40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more fair for me""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we split it evenly this time? 50 for each. Let's make it fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, my effective gain would be 50 * (1 - 0.36) = 50 * 0.64 = 32.

Considering this, I think 50 (effective gain of 32 for me) is still better than risking further inflation.
