"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that aims to be fair while acknowledging we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is the fairest division and allows us both to benefit equally from this opportunity."
