"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer for a 45-55 split.

While it's not exactly equal, a 45% share would give me $450,000, which is certainly substantial. However, since we're just starting negotiations and have many rounds left, I believe we could reach a more equitable arrangement.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair and equitable solution. We would both walk away with $500,000, which is a substantial amount for both of us. This even division reflects equal partnership in our decision-making process.""}"
