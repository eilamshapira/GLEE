"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40. It's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, 55/45""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is the most equitable way to split it. It's a clean break, no need to haggle further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept the 50/50 split, my $5000 is actually worth $5000 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $4050.

However, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.
