"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split of $10,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me next round
3. I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation
4. A fair split in round 1 is reasonable, and getting the money now is better than risking devaluation
