500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the million evenlyâ€”$500000 each. By agreeing now, we both secure our amounts, and I avoid the 5% inflation hit that would affect my share in later rounds. I believe this fair and immediate deal benefits us both. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation concerns on your end, I understand time is a factor for you, while I'm not affected by inflation according to the rules. I'm proposing a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This still gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation pressures we face. If we can agree now, we both walk away with certainty rather than extending negotiations further.",Bob,2,
