"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the million evenlyâ€”$500,000 each. By agreeing now, we both secure our amounts, and I avoid the 5% inflation hit that would affect my share in later rounds. I believe this fair and immediate deal benefits us both. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation concerns on your end, I understand time is a factor for you, while I'm not affected by inflation according to the rules. I'm proposing a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This still gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation pressures we face. If we can agree now, we both walk away with certainty rather than extending negotiations further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
