"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million evenlyâ€”$500000 each. By agreeing now, we both secure our amounts, and I avoid the 5% inflation hit that would affect my share in later rounds. I believe this fair and immediate deal benefits us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000. 

She mentions she would face a 5% inflation hit in later rounds, but according to the rules, the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round (no inflation for me). I don't know what inflation effect Alice experiences.

Since there's no inflation for me, if I reject this offer, I could potentially make a more favorable proposal in the next round. However, there's also risk that Alice might reject my next proposal, extending the game further.

The current offer is fair in absolute terms (equal split), but I might be able to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds if Alice is indeed facing inflation pressure.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while still being reasonable, given the information that Alice may be facing inflation effects.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation concerns on your end, I understand time is a factor for you, while I'm not affected by inflation according to the rules. I'm proposing a split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This still gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation pressures we face. If we can agree now, we both walk away with certainty rather than extending negotiations further.""}"
