"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This actually benefits us both compared to continuing negotiations further, since inflation hits me harder (10%) than you (5%). If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose value. This offer is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and Bob's argument, I think it's a reasonable offer. However, I'd like to weigh my options carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the $45 I'd get is equivalent to $45 / 0.95 = $47.37 in the first round's value. 

Given this, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
