"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically here. 

With a 50-50 split, I would get $50 now. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me (down to $90 total value), but only 5% for Alice (down to $95 total value).

If I reject and propose something like a 60-40 split in my favor in the next round, I'd get $54 (60% of $90), which is better than $50 now. However, Alice might reject that offer, leading to further rounds and more devaluation.

Given the different inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal by negotiating, so I'll reject this initial even split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that considers the inflation and gives both of us a good outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This actually benefits us both compared to continuing negotiations further, since inflation hits me harder (10%) than you (5%). If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose value. This offer is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates.""}"
