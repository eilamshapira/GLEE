Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a 50-50 split, but taking into account that the total value is now 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000 for me.

{""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""alice_gain"": 525000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I would get is 90.25% of $550,000 (since it's 9.75% less than the original value), which is approximately $495,875, and Alice would get 81% of $450,000 (since it's 19% less than the original value), which is approximately $364,500.

Given that Alice's offer gives me more than half of the total value, I'll accept it.
