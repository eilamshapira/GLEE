"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting $50 in the next round (which would be worth $45 due to inflation)
5. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty
