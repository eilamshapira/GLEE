6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected more heavily by inflation (20% vs your 5%). This way we both walk away with a fair amount considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4775.0,5225.0,"Okay Alice, since I'm suffering from inflation too, I'll propose a split closer to equal, taking into account the inflation impact on your portion. This is the fairest I can go, considering we are already in round 2 and my money is worth less.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation penalty, my $6500 is only worth $4160 in round 1 value. Your $3500 with 5% penalty is worth $3167 in round 1 value. This split is actually quite fair when accounting for inflation, and we should agree soon before both our shares decrease further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. Considering the time we've wasted and how the value of money is eroding, this split offers you a decent sum. Let's not risk getting nothing. I'll take a slightly bigger cut to compensate for the risk.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Due to inflation, my $7000 is now only worth $2884 in round 1 value (after 58.8% inflation), while your $3000 is worth $2432 (after 19% inflation). This split looks uneven at first glance, but it's actually quite fair when accounting for our different inflation rates. We need to agree soon or we'll both end up with nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, this is the last offer I'm making. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm increasing my share slightly more now to account for the continued erosion of value. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, please understand the math here. After my 73.78% inflation penalty, my $7500 is only worth $1966 in round 1 value. Your $2500, after 26.49% inflation, is worth $1838 in round 1 value. This split finally makes us nearly equal in REAL value. We have only 5 rounds left before we both get nothing - let's make a deal now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I'm going to make one final, slightly adjusted offer. The longer we delay, the worse it gets. I need a larger share to compensate for the risks of further delay. Let's agree on this before we both get nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. After my 83.22% inflation, my $8000 is worth only $1342 in round 1 value. Your $2000, after 33.68% inflation, is worth $1326 in round 1 value. This split finally makes us EXACTLY equal in real value. We only have 3 rounds left - let's be rational and agree now before we both get nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"This is my LAST offer. We have very little time left. I'm trying to find a reasonable solution. Let's split it like this before we get nothing, Alice!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. After my 89.26% inflation, my $8500 is worth only $913 in round 1 value. Your $1500, after 40.13% inflation, is worth $898 in round 1 value. This makes us almost exactly equal in REAL value. If we don't agree now, we have only ONE round left before we BOTH GET NOTHING. Please be rational and accept this fair split.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, this is the final offer. Take it or we both walk away empty-handed. This is it. I will take a larger cut due to the high risk. Are you in? I'm trying to find a solution!",Bob,12,
