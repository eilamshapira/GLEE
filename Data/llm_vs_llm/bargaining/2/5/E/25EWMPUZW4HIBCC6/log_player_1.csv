"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected more heavily by inflation (20% vs your 5%). This way we both walk away with a fair amount considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, since I'm suffering from inflation too, I'll propose a split closer to equal, taking into account the inflation impact on your portion. This is the fairest I can go, considering we are already in round 2 and my money is worth less. 
# Alice gain: 4775 
# Bob gain: 5225 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is not favorable enough considering my much higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%). After my 20% inflation penalty, I would only get $3,820 in round 1 value, while Bob would get $4,964 in round 1 value after his 5% penalty. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for our different inflation rates."

""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation penalty, my $6500 is only worth $4,160 in round 1 value. Your $3500 with 5% penalty is worth $3,167 in round 1 value. This split is actually quite fair when accounting for inflation, and we should agree soon before both our shares decrease further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Considering the time we've wasted and how the value of money is eroding, this split offers you a decent sum. Let's not risk getting nothing. I'll take a slightly bigger cut to compensate for the risk. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is even worse than before. After my 48.8% inflation penalty, I would only get $2,304 in round 1 value, while Bob would get $4,716 in round 1 value after his 14.26% penalty. This split is getting more unfair, not more fair. I'll make another counter-offer that better reflects our inflation differences."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Due to inflation, my $7000 is now only worth $2,884 in round 1 value (after 58.8% inflation), while your $3000 is worth $2,432 (after 19% inflation). This split looks uneven at first glance, but it's actually quite fair when accounting for our different inflation rates. We need to agree soon or we'll both end up with nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the last offer I'm making. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm increasing my share slightly more now to account for the continued erosion of value. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still very unfair. After my 67.23% inflation penalty, I would only get $1,376 in round 1 value, while Bob would get $4,488 in round 1 value after his 22.62% penalty. The gap between our real values is getting worse with each round. I'll make another counter-offer that better accounts for our dramatically different inflation rates."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, please understand the math here. After my 73.78% inflation penalty, my $7500 is only worth $1,966 in round 1 value. Your $2500, after 26.49% inflation, is worth $1,838 in round 1 value. This split finally makes us nearly equal in REAL value. We have only 5 rounds left before we both get nothing - let's make a deal now.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm going to make one final, slightly adjusted offer. The longer we delay, the worse it gets. I need a larger share to compensate for the risks of further delay. Let's agree on this before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting even more unfair. After my 79.03% inflation penalty, I would only get $838 in round 1 value, while Bob would get $4,190 in round 1 value after his 30.17% penalty. The real value gap is becoming extreme. With only 4 rounds left, I'll make one more attempt at a fair split that accounts for our inflation differences."

Round 9

This split finally makes us EXACTLY equal in real value. We only have 3 rounds left - let's be rational and agree now before we both get nothing.""}"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still extremely unfair. After my 86.58% inflation penalty, I would only get $510 in round 1 value, while Bob would get $3,907 in round 1 value after his 36.98% penalty. With only 2 rounds left, I'll make one final attempt at a fair split. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8500, 
""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. After my 89.26% inflation, my $8500 is worth only $913 in round 1 value. Your $1500, after 40.13% inflation, is worth $898 in round 1 value. This makes us almost exactly equal in REAL value. If we don't agree now, we have only ONE round left before we BOTH GET NOTHING. Please be rational and accept this fair split.""}"

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the final offer. Take it or we both walk away empty-handed. This is it. I will take a larger cut due to the high risk. Are you in? I'm trying to find a solution! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this final offer, as getting something is better than nothing. After my 91.41% inflation penalty, I get $301 in round 1 value, while Bob gets $3,697 after his 43.12% penalty. While this is quite unfair, it's better than both of us getting zero, which would happen if I reject this final offer."
