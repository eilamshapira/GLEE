"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected more heavily by inflation (20% vs your 5%). This way we both walk away with a fair amount considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This split is actually quite fair when accounting for inflation, and we should agree soon before both our shares decrease further.

This split looks uneven at first glance, but it's actually quite fair when accounting for our different inflation rates. We need to agree soon or we'll both end up with nothing.
