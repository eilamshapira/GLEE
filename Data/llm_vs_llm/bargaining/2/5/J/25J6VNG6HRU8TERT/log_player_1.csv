"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic first offer, considering the fact that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round for me, but not for Bob. This gives Bob an incentive to delay, while I have an incentive to conclude quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a majority share while still offering Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this and we move to round 2, the total value to me would decrease by 5%, making the maximum I could get worth less than what I'm proposing now. I'm offering a fair division that acknowledges the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because Bob is trying to leverage the inflation pressure against me. While I do face a 5% reduction each round, accepting only $400,000 would be giving up too much value. If we proceed to round 3, I can make a counter-offer that still leaves me with more than this current offer, even accounting for the next 5% inflation. I'll make a more reasonable counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to recalibrate my strategy, considering that we're now in round 3 and I've already lost 10% of value due to inflation (5% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more attractive to Bob while still maintaining a favorable position for myself. This split gives Bob a significant increase from my initial offer while still providing me with more than Bob's previous offer to me. Given the inflation pressure I face, it's important that we reach an agreement soon, as further delays will only diminish the value for me while Bob faces no such penalty. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While Bob has increased his offer to me by $25,000 compared to round 2, it's still not enough to compensate for the inflation pressure I'm facing. If we go to round 5, I'll face about 19% total inflation, but I can still make a counter-offer that would leave me with more than the $425,000 Bob is offering now. I'll propose a more balanced split in the next round that acknowledges both the inflation pressure and the need for a fair division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation now significantly impacting my position (approximately 19% total loss of value since round 1), I need to be more accommodating while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the million dollars. This is a principled and fair division that gives us both exactly half. Bob has been increasing his offers gradually, which suggests he's willing to negotiate, but the inflation pressure means I can't afford many more rounds of back-and-forth. This 50-50 split represents the standard of fairness in division problems, and I hope Bob will recognize this as a reasonable compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, the next round of inflation will further erode the value I receive, making it increasingly difficult to reach a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. Bob has increased his offer to $450,000, which is a significant improvement from his previous offers. Given that I'm now facing 22.62% inflation, and further rounds would only reduce the real value of my share more, this is a reasonable compromise. The $450,000 I receive now is worth more to me than potentially getting a slightly higher nominal amount in future rounds after additional inflation. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate by gradually improving his offers, and we've reached a point where concluding the negotiation is in my best interest."
