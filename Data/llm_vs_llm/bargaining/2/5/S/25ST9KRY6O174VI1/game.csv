6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you lose more value per round (10% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept this reasonable offer now.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both deserve an equal share of the money. Yes, I do lose more to inflation each round, but that doesn't justify such a large imbalance in the initial division. I'm proposing we split it evenly at $5000 each.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation, you've already lost 20% of your value while I've lost 10%. A 55-45 split is very reasonable considering the inflation difference. If we keep going, we'll both lose more money. This is a fair compromise between your 50-50 and my previous 60-40.",Alice,3,
