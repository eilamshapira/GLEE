"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you lose more value per round (10% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept this reasonable offer now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both deserve an equal share of the money. Yes, I do lose more to inflation each round, but that doesn't justify such a large imbalance in the initial division. I'm proposing we split it evenly at $5000 each. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation, you've already lost 20% of your value while I've lost 10%. A 55-45 split is very reasonable considering the inflation difference. If we keep going, we'll both lose more money. This is a fair compromise between your 50-50 and my previous 60-40.""}"
