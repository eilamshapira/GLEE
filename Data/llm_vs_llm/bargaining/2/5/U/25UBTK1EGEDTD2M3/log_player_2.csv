"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – since waiting only hurts me with the inflation penalty and you remain unaffected, I’m proposing a division where you get the whole $100 now. I believe this is fair given the time‐value differences. I hope you accept so we can both avoid further delays. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
