"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split this more evenly. Inflation is eating away at my gains. This is a fair offer, let's take it! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation concern. This offer is better for you than last round, and it still gives me a slight advantage.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Inflation is really hurting me now. Let's take this split and both walk away with something. It's better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reason: While I'd prefer my previous offer, accepting this prevents me from potentially getting a worse offer in the next round due to inflation further decreasing the value of Bob's gains, which could lead him to make a more selfish proposal.  Getting $40 is better than risking getting even less."
