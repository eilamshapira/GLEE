"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money will be worth 10% less each round if he refuses. This gives me some negotiating leverage, but I should still make a reasonable offer to get it accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation penalty only affecting him."
