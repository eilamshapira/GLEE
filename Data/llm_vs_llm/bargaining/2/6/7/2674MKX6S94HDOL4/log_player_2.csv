"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round when I make a proposal. So my $4,000 would effectively become worth $3,200 in the next round.

While the split isn't perfectly equal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation through inflation, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Alice. There's also no guarantee that Alice would accept a more favorable proposal from me in the next round.
