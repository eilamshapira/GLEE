"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face higher depreciation (20% per round) than I do (5%), this 60-40 split is fair and makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than lose value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
