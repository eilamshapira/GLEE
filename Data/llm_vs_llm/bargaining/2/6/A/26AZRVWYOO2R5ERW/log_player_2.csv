"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and get it over with! I'm offering you 30%. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $3,000 out of $10,000, which is a 30-70 split in her favor. If I reject and we go to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me
2. The money will be worth 20% less to her
3. I get to make the next offer

Since Alice has a much higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage by waiting. She'll be more pressured to accept a better deal for me in later rounds.

$3,000 is too low for an initial offer. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice will lose 20% value per round while I only lose 5%, I should propose a more balanced split, but still in my favor. The threat of continued depreciation should make this attractive to her.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since you face higher depreciation (20% per round) than I do (5%), this 60-40 split is fair and makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than lose value in future rounds.""}"
