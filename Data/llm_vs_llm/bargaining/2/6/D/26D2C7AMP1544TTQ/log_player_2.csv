"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair. If I reject and make a counter-offer, there's a risk that Alice might reject it too, and we'd lose 20% of the total value. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
