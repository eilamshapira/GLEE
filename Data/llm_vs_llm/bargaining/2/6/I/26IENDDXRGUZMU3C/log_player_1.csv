"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that takes into account the inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to a fair split but gives me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth less due to inflation, so this is a balanced opening offer that gives both of us a good outcome."
