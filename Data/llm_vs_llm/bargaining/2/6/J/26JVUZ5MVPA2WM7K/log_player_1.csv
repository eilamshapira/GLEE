Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the generosity, but I think a 90/10 split in my favor is a more fair reflection of our contributions.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
