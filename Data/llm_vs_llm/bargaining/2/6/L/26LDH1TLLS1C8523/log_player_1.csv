"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I want to be fair but also consider that inflation will reduce the value of the money for me by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500 Bob, which is slightly less than half. I believe this is a fair split considering we both want to finish this quickly to avoid inflation reducing our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
