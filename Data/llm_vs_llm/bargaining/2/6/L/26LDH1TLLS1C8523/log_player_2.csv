"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,500 (45% of the total)
- There are still 11 rounds left
- No inflation affects my gains
- It's a reasonable first offer, but I can probably get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair but slightly more favorable offer for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives me a bit more than Alice's initial proposal while still being reasonable. It's closer to a 50-50 split, which could be seen as more fair. Since there's no inflation affecting my gains, I can afford to be patient but also don't want to risk too many rounds of negotiation."
