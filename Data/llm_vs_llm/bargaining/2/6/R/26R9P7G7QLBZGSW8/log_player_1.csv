"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was quite unbalanced in your favor. Given that I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, I'm proposing a more equitable split. This gives you a substantial $400000 while recognizing my time pressure. I hope we can agree and avoid further delays that would reduce the value for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
