"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I think this is a good deal for both of us considering the time constraint! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite unbalanced in her favor. She's proposing that I get only $100,000 while she gets $900,000 of the $1,000,000 total. Given that I face 10% inflation per round, I would still be better off making a counter-offer in the next round, as even with inflation I could propose a much better split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, considering the inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was quite unbalanced in your favor. Given that I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, I'm proposing a more equitable split. This gives you a substantial $400,000 while recognizing my time pressure. I hope we can agree and avoid further delays that would reduce the value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation hurts us both. To show good faith, I'm increasing your share. Let's finalize this quickly so we both get something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has significantly improved her offer from $100,000 to $450,000 for me. With inflation already reducing my purchasing power by 19%, delaying further would continue to decrease the value of my potential gain. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a substantial portion while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm under.
