"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. It's a fair start, considering I initiated the proposal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me 40% of the $1,000,000, which means I would get $400,000. This is a substantial amount of money. However, I could potentially make a counter-offer in the next round that gives me a higher percentage.

Since I would be the one making the proposal in the next round if I reject, I think I should try to negotiate for a more equal split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I believe a 50-50 split would be the most fair approach for both of us. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is quite substantial. I hope you'll find this equitable.""}"
