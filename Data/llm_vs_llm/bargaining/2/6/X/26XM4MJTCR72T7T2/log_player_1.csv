"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds. I want to start with a reasonable split that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage but is not overly greedy
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to 10% inflation
3. It's fair enough that Bob might accept immediately rather than risk a worse offer after inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4300, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $3870 to me
   * Bob gets $5700

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But I'll face another 10% inflation (total 20% from original value)
   * Any amount I get will be worth even less to me

3. Bob's offer, while giving him more, is not extremely unfair considering the inflation I'm facing. If I reject and go to the next round, I might end up with even less value due to compounding inflation.
