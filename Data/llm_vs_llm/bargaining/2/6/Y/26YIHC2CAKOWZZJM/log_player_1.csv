"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and accepting now means you'll get the full value of your share without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the need for a swift resolution. To that end, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Accepting this offer now will protect us both from any further uncertainties or inflation impacts, ensuring we each secure our share with no more delays. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My potential gain is $450,000, but with 5% inflation, it's actually worth $427,500 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's offer is relatively reasonable, not too far from a 50-50 split
4. Further negotiations might lead to more value loss for me due to inflation
