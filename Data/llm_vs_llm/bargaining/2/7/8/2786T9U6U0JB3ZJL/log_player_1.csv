"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering that I face 10% inflation per round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself because I know I'll face 10% inflation if we go to the next round. This is a fair split that gives us both a substantial amount and lets us avoid losing value to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, to make it fair for both of us, I propose an equal split. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Let's avoid further rounds and the potential loss of value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
