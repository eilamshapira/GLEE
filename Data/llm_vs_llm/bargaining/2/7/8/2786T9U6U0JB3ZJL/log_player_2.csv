"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself because I know I'll face 10% inflation if we go to the next round. This is a fair split that gives us both a substantial amount and lets us avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
