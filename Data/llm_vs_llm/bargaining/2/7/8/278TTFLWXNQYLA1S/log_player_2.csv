"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and fair - I offer you 400k, which is a substantial amount. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation, especially me since my loss rate is higher. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $400,000 and the total amount is $1,000,000, I'll consider it. However, I also need to think about the inflation and the fact that Alice's loss rate is higher.

Considering the first round and the substantial amount offered, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer to avoid further loss due to inflation.
