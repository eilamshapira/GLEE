Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. This way we both get an equal share. Let's agree now - with inflation affecting both of us (especially me at 20%), delaying just hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
