"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'll take 60, you get 40. It's a good start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) compared to Alice's 10% per round, there's pressure to reach an agreement sooner. However, this initial offer gives Alice a significant advantage.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my 40 would be worth 32 (after 20% inflation) if we delay to round 3. But I could potentially negotiate for more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. This way we both get an equal share. Let's agree now - with inflation affecting both of us (especially me at 20%), delaying just hurts us both.""}"
