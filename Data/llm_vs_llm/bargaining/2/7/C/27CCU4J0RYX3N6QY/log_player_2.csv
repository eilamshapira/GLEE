"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

This is a $4000/$6000 split in Alice's favor. While it's not an extreme proposal, I don't think it's entirely fair. Since this is just the first round and we have more rounds to negotiate (though keeping in mind the 5% inflation penalty per round), I believe I can get a better deal.

The 5% inflation means in the next round the total value will be $9,500. Even with that reduction, there's room to negotiate for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering we both want to reach an agreement and avoid losing value to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and we can both walk away with a good outcome without risking further value loss from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but time is literally money here.  I'll concede a bit, but let's finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation...

Alice has moved slightly in my direction from her initial 4000/6000 split to 4200/5800. However, considering the 9.75% inflation:
- The real value of my $4200 would be approximately $3,791
- The total pot's real value is now $9,025

While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, this offer still gives me less real value than her first offer would have. Given that we still have 9 rounds left, although with increasing inflation penalties, I think there's still room for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm moving towards your position to show good faith. This is a very reasonable split that acknowledges your first-mover advantage while still being fair. With inflation eating into our gains, we should reach an agreement soon.""}"
