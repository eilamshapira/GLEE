"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering our inflation rates.

Since Bob faces a 20% inflation each round, he has more incentive to accept an early offer than I do with my 5% inflation. I'll offer a slightly favorable split for myself but still reasonable for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because it's fair to give you a substantial portion of the money, Bob, while acknowledging that waiting is costlier for you than for me. If we both move to the next round, the total value decreases more for you than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer of $55 for me and $45 for Bob.

Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, which due to 5% inflation is worth 95% of the original value, so $55 × 0.95 = $52.25 in round 1 terms
- If I reject and offer a different split in round 3, Bob would face another 20% inflation, making his money worth only 80% × 80% = 64% of the original value
- I would face another 5% inflation, making my money worth 95% × 95% = 90.25% of the original value

Given that Bob is offering me a reasonable amount ($55) and the inflation will continue to reduce the overall value, this seems like a fair compromise.
