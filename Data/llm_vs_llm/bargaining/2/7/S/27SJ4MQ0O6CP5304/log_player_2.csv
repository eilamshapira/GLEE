"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 50-50 split of the money. This way we both benefit equally. I should mention that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given our inflation rates. Alice claims she loses 10% value per round, while I know I lose 5% per round.

At a 50-50 split ($5000 each), I would get $5000 now. If I reject and propose in the next round, I'd receive at most $9500 (95% of $10,000), but Alice would likely reject an extremely uneven split.

Given that we both face inflation and need to reach an agreement quickly, this seems like a reasonable first offer.
