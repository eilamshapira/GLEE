55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation impacts us both, but affects you more. If we drag this out, we both lose value - your money decreases 20% per round while mine only 10%. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I think I deserve a bigger share. Considering the inflation rate, I'm taking a bigger risk by not accepting your offer. I'm willing to give you $40, but I need $60 to make it worth my while. Let's settle this quickly before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't accept just $40. Remember that with each round, your money loses 20% value while mine loses only 10%. Already by round 3, your $60 is actually worth only $60×0.8×0.8=$38.4 in round 1 terms, while my offer of $40 to you would still be worth $40×0.8×0.8=$25.6. I'm offering you $40 now, which is fair given the inflation rates. Let's not waste more rounds and lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still believe I can get a better deal. By rejecting your offer, I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to do so to get a fair share. Considering the money's value has already decreased, I'm offering you $35, which is a significant portion, but I need $65 to make up for the loss in value due to inflation. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,4,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, this negotiation is causing us both to lose value rapidly. Let's be practical - by round 5, your inflation rate has severely impacted your potential gain. Your $65 from last round is only worth $65×0.8^4=$26.62 in round 1 terms, while my offer of $35 to you now is worth $35×0.8^4=$14.34. I'm offering you $35, which is still substantial given the circumstances. If we continue, you'll lose even more value due to your higher inflation rate. This is a reasonable offer - let's conclude this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I know the inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm offering you $30, which is still a significant amount considering the value has decreased. I need $70 to feel like I'm getting a fair share, given the risks I'm taking by continuing the negotiation. Let's not forget, you're also losing value, even if it's at a slower rate. I'm willing to take one more chance to get a better deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7, and the inflation is severely impacting both of us. Your higher 20% inflation rate means your money is worth only 0.8^6 = 26.2% of its original value, while mine is worth 0.9^6 = 53.1%. At this point, your $70 from last round is worth only $18.34 in round 1 value. My offer of $25 to you is still worth $6.55 in original value. We've already lost so much by continuing this negotiation. If we go to round 12, we both get nothing. Please consider accepting this offer before we both walk away with nothing of value.",Alice,7,
