"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation impacts us both, but affects you more. If we drag this out, we both lose value - your money decreases 20% per round while mine only 10%. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I think I deserve a bigger share. Considering the inflation rate, I'm taking a bigger risk by not accepting your offer. I'm willing to give you $40, but I need $60 to make it worth my while. Let's settle this quickly before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't accept just $40. Remember that with each round, your money loses 20% value while mine loses only 10%. Already by round 3, your $60 is actually worth only $60×0.8×0.8=$38.4 in round 1 terms, while my offer of $40 to you would still be worth $40×0.8×0.8=$25.6. I'm offering you $40 now, which is fair given the inflation rates. Let's not waste more rounds and lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still believe I can get a better deal. By rejecting your offer, I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to do so to get a fair share. Considering the money's value has already decreased, I'm offering you $35, which is a significant portion, but I need $65 to make up for the loss in value due to inflation. Let's settle this before it's too late.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this negotiation is causing us both to lose value rapidly. Let's be practical - by round 5, your inflation rate has severely impacted your potential gain. Your $65 from last round is only worth $65×0.8^4=$26.62 in round 1 terms, while my offer of $35 to you now is worth $35×0.8^4=$14.34. I'm offering you $35, which is still substantial given the circumstances. If we continue, you'll lose even more value due to your higher inflation rate. This is a reasonable offer - let's conclude this deal. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm offering you $30, which is still a significant amount considering the value has decreased. I need $70 to feel like I'm getting a fair share, given the risks I'm taking by continuing the negotiation. Let's not forget, you're also losing value, even if it's at a slower rate. I'm willing to take one more chance to get a better deal.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 7, and the inflation is severely impacting both of us. Your higher 20% inflation rate means your money is worth only 0.8^6 = 26.2% of its original value, while mine is worth 0.9^6 = 53.1%. At this point, your $70 from last round is worth only $18.34 in round 1 value. My offer of $25 to you is still worth $6.55 in original value. We've already lost so much by continuing this negotiation. If we go to round 12, we both get nothing. Please consider accepting this offer before we both walk away with nothing of value. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75
