"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that there's 20% inflation per round for me, I should aim for a fair but advantageous first offer. A slightly higher split in my favor might encourage Bob to accept early while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'd like to offer a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
* My $50 is actually worth $50 * 0.8 = $40 in round 1 terms
* Bob's $50 maintains its full value

While this is less favorable than my initial offer, if I reject, the next round will have even more inflation for me (worth only 64% of original value). Bob's equal split offer is actually quite reasonable given my inflation disadvantage, and waiting longer will only hurt my position further.
