5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split: $5500 for me and $4500 for you. By agreeing now, we avoid any further delays (and potential inflation effects on my end), ensuring we both secure our shares promptly. I believe it's a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. What do you say?",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Okay Alice, since you value speed, I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer and avoids further negotiation. Take it or leave it!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'll pass on this 50/50. Given the current inflation on your end, there's room for a more favorable split for me if we continue negotiating. Let's move on to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on your share increases with each delay. In round 3 your money is worth 10% less than its nominal value. If we continue to delay, you risk even further losses. To help you secure a better effective amount now, I’m offering you $4800 (which effectively is $4320 after the 10% discount), while I receive $5200. This deal gives you a higher effective return than waiting for the next round. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I'm aware of my diminishing returns, but I still believe I deserve more. Considering the previous offers, I propose this: $5200 for me, $4800 for you. This offer also accounts for the delay. Let's finalize it.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand the inflation effect on your part. However, as my share's value remains constant, I feel that a division that gives me $4800 doesn't fully account for the current negotiation dynamics. I believe there's room for a proposal that better reflects our respective positions. Let's continue negotiating for a fairer split.",Alice,4,reject
4520.0,5480.0,"Hi Bob, I know that with each round your dollars lose value—in round 5 your money is now roughly 18.75% less valuable than in round 1. With further delays, this loss will only worsen your effective gain. In this light, I propose that you receive $5480 (which comes out to about $4450 in today’s value) and I receive $4520, which preserves much more of my value. This division secures you a better effective payoff than what you risk by waiting additional rounds. I believe it’s in both our interests to agree now. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, this is the final offer. I am increasing my offer to $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This accounts for the diminishing value of the money. It's a slightly better deal for me. Take it or I walk.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, your final offer is acceptable. With my money retaining its full value and yours effectively being about 22.62% less valuable (making your 5500 worth roughly 4256), I find that receiving 4500 in full value is a favorable outcome for me. Let's finalize the deal. Thank you!",Alice,6,accept
