What do you say?""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, since you value speed, I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer and avoids further negotiation. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'll pass on this 50/50. Given the current inflation on your end, there's room for a more favorable split for me if we continue negotiating. Let's move on to the next round.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on your share increases with each delay. In round 3 your money is worth 10% less than its nominal value. If we continue to delay, you risk even further losses. To help you secure a better effective amount now, I’m offering you $4800 (which effectively is $4320 after the 10% discount), while I receive $5200. This deal gives you a higher effective return than waiting for the next round. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aware of my diminishing returns, but I still believe I deserve more. Considering the previous offers, I propose this: $5200 for me, $4800 for you. This offer also accounts for the delay. Let's finalize it. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand the inflation effect on your part. However, as my share's value remains constant, I feel that a division that gives me $4800 doesn't fully account for the current negotiation dynamics. I believe there's room for a proposal that better reflects our respective positions. Let's continue negotiating for a fairer split.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4520, ""bob_gain"": 5480, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with each round your dollars lose value—in round 5 your money is now roughly 18.75% less valuable than in round 1. With further delays, this loss will only worsen your effective gain. In this light, I propose that you receive $5480 (which comes out to about $4450 in today’s value) and I receive $4520, which preserves much more of my value. This division secures you a better effective payoff than what you risk by waiting additional rounds. I believe it’s in both our interests to agree now. What do you say?""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the final offer. I am increasing my offer to $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This accounts for the diminishing value of the money. It's a slightly better deal for me. Take it or I walk. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, your final offer is acceptable.
