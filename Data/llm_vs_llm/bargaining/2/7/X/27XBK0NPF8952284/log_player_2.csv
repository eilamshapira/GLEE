Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split: $5500 for me and $4500 for you. By agreeing now, we avoid any further delays (and potential inflation effects on my end), ensuring we both secure our shares promptly. I believe it's a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. What do you say?

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on your share increases with each delay. In round 3 your money is worth 10% less than its nominal value. If we continue to delay, you risk even further losses. To help you secure a better effective amount now, I’m offering you $4800 (which effectively is $4320 after the 10% discount), while I receive $5200. This deal gives you a higher effective return than waiting for the next round. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with each round your dollars lose value—in round 5 your money is now roughly 18.75% less valuable than in round 1. With further delays, this loss will only worsen your effective gain. In this light, I propose that you receive $5480 (which comes out to about $4450 in today’s value) and I receive $4520, which preserves much more of my value. This division secures you a better effective payoff than what you risk by waiting additional rounds. I believe it’s in both our interests to agree now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5480 
# Alice gain: 4520 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
