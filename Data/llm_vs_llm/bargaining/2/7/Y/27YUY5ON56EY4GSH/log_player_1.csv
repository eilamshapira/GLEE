"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a fair and reasonable offer to divide the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. With this division, we both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid the 10% inflation penalty that would reduce the total value if we move to another round."
