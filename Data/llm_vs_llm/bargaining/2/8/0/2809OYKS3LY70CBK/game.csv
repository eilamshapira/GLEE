550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You lose more value per round than I do (20% vs 10%), so it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now. This split takes into account the fact that I go first and gives you a substantial portion. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth 20% less, making this an attractive offer for you.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates for both of us, my offer reflects a fair adjustment for the second round. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you, which accounts for the potential losses in value I face in future rounds. This way, we both leave the table with a good portion.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be rational about this. With each round, your money loses 20% of its value while mine only loses 10%. If you reject this offer and we go to round 4, the $400000 I'm offering you now would only be worth $320000 to you in the next round. Meanwhile, I can afford to wait as my money depreciates slower. This offer gives you 40% of the total sum, which is fair given our different inflation rates. Let's conclude this now so we both walk away with substantial value.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, let's find a middle ground. My new offer is 45% for me and 55% for you. This respects the inflation aspect while still aiming for a fairer split. I hope we can wrap it up this round so we both retain good value.",Bob,4,
