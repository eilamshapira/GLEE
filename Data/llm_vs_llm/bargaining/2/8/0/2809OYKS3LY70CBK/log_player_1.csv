"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You lose more value per round than I do (20% vs 10%), so it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now. This split takes into account the fact that I go first and gives you a substantial portion. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth 20% less, making this an attractive offer for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates for both of us, my offer reflects a fair adjustment for the second round. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you, which accounts for the potential losses in value I face in future rounds. This way, we both leave the table with a good portion. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational about this. With each round, your money loses 20% of its value while mine only loses 10%. If you reject this offer and we go to round 4, the $400,000 I'm offering you now would only be worth $320,000 to you in the next round. Meanwhile, I can afford to wait as my money depreciates slower. This offer gives you 40% of the total sum, which is fair given our different inflation rates. Let's conclude this now so we both walk away with substantial value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's find a middle ground. My new offer is 45% for me and 55% for you. This respects the inflation aspect while still aiming for a fairer split. I hope we can wrap it up this round so we both retain good value. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
