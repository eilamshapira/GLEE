Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough decision, and it hinges on my assessment of Alice's perception of the inflation. Here's why I reject:

* **Inflation Impact:** While the offer is seemingly balanced, the inflation means I'm actually getting significantly less in real value than the nominal amount suggests. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice rejecting my previous offer and then countering with a seemingly ""fair"" offer suggests she might not be factoring in inflation the same way I am. 

I'm hoping that by continuing to reject, I signal to Alice that I'm aiming for a more significantly favorable split to account for the inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 

I am raising my demand slightly to further emphasize the impact of inflation. I need Alice to make a move that acknowledges the money is losing value for me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While not ideal, the relentless march of inflation makes this offer the most palatable I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking even greater losses due to inflation in later rounds."
