Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is starting to hurt, but holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy at this point."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is becoming a significant factor now. However, accepting this offer would mean losing over half of the initial potential gains due to the decreasing value. I'm hoping Alice will be more reasonable soon, as the shrinking pot will also affect her."
