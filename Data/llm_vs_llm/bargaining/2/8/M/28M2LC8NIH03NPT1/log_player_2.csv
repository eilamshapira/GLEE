"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 83 
# Alice gain: 17 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $83, which is quite generous
- If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but:
  - The money will be worth 5% less to me
  - Even if I ask for more, Alice might reject
  - We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds
- This is already a very good deal for me (83% of the total)
