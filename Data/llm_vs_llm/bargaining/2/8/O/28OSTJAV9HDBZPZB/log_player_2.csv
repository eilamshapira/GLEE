"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With Alice offering me $40 in the first round:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
2. $40 in this round is better than $50 in the next round (which would only be worth $40 to me due to inflation)
3. However, this is the first round, and Alice's opening offer giving herself more than half might indicate room for negotiation

I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a better deal, even considering the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair, and we should agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
