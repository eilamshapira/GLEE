"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for the first round, considering the 10% inflation per round that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm facing inflation pressure with each round. If we can agree quickly, we both benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer for round 3, recognizing that we need to come to an agreement soon as inflation is affecting us both.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split. I now know inflation affects you at 5% per round while it affects me at 10% per round. This offer is fairer given our different inflation rates, and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount before inflation erodes too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see we need to find a compromise quickly, as the inflation is reducing our potential gains with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that acknowledges both of our inflation pressures. Given that I'm losing value at 10% per round and you're losing at 5% per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This even split should be acceptable to both of us and allow us to conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
