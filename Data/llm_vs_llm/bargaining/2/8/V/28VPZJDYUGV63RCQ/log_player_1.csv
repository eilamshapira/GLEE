"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I need to consider a fair division while taking into account that the money will be worth 10% less to me in each subsequent round if we don't reach an agreement now.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for myself, but still reasonably fair. I believe this balanced approach gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face inflation pressure if we delay agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. Since we're in round 2, any money I receive is already worth 10% less to me due to inflation. If I reject and we move to round 3, my share would face even more inflation (20% total). Bob's offer of $45 to me is fair considering the circumstances, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in diminishing returns for me due to the higher inflation rate I'm experiencing compared to Bob (10% vs 5% per round)."
