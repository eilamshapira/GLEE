"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, Bob. This is a fair split considering that money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). If we continue to the next round, both of us will lose value. Let's agree now and both walk away with substantial amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering our inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

Bob, I'm offering you $480,000 now. Note that because of our different inflation rates, if you reject this and we go to round 4, the money will be worth significantly less to you. For me, my share is still worth 520000 × 0.9² = 421,200 effective dollars, while your share would be worth 480000 × 0.8² = 307,200 effective dollars. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. Let's end this now with a reasonable split that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll revise my offer considering our continued inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 490000, 
""bob_gain"": 510000}

Bob, I'm now offering you the majority share of $510,000. This is more than fair considering our inflation rates. At this point, my share is effectively worth 490000 × 0.9⁴ = 323,433 in original value, while your share would be worth 510000 × 0.8⁴ = 209,100 in original value. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose almost 40% more value. This is my best offer that acknowledges both our positions. Let's conclude this negotiation now in a way that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more generous offer given our significant inflation rates at this point.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000}

Bob, I'm now offering you $550,000 - a clear majority of the total. At this stage, my $450,000 is only worth 450000 × 0.9⁶ = 240,435 in original value, while your $550,000 would be worth 550000 × 0.8⁶ = 146,432 in original value. 

The inflation is severely impacting both of us, but especially you. If we go another round, you'll lose another 20% of value. This is an extremely fair offer that gives you the majority share while still allowing me to salvage reasonable value. Let's end this now before further rounds diminish our gains even more."
