"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation effect for myself while making this offer.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer, hoping Bob will accept it. I am aware of the inflation effect, so I would like to get a larger share from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and Bob's offer carefully. My $6000 in the previous round would be worth $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 this round. Bob is offering me $4000. While less than what I initially asked for, it's still a significant amount and avoids further inflation. Considering the 12-round limit and the risk of getting nothing, I'll accept.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
