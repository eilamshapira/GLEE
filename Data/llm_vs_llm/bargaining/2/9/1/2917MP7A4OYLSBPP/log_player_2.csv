"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the first offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 Ã— 0.8 = $80 total value for me in next round
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split, the reduced value makes it less attractive

The current offer of $40 is better than a potentially higher percentage of a deflated amount in the next round. For example, even if I got 60% in the next round, that would be $48 of the deflated $80 value.
