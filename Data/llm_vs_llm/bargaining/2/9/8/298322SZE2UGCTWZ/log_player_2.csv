"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair and generous offer. Take it, or you'll regret it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a reasonable offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being more reasonable now. This is the best you'll get. Take it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $400,000 I'd gain is actually worth $400,000 * 0.81 = $324,000 in the original value. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (10% less each round, so 30% less than the original value in round 4), I'll make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, considering my losses to inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, fine. A perfectly even split. Are you happy now? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $500,000 I'd gain is actually worth $500,000 * 0.6561 = $328,050 in the original value. 

Given that the value is decreasing rapidly for me, an even split, although initially seeming unfair to Alice, is now more favorable to me due to the inflation.
