"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob in Round 1.

I need to consider that Bob faces 5% inflation per round while I face 0% inflation. This means Bob has a stronger incentive to accept earlier rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I believe this is a fair opening offer that acknowledges the inflation disadvantage Bob faces. If Bob rejects this offer, he'll make a counter-offer in Round 2, but the $100 will be worth 5% less to him at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer in Round 3.

Bob's rejected my initial 55/45 split and countered with 43/57 in his favor. Now that we're in Round 3, inflation has reduced the value to Bob by about 10% from the original value.

I'll adjust my offer slightly to account for this:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48}

This is more generous to Bob than my first offer while still giving me a slight advantage. Given the continued inflation pressure Bob faces, this should be more attractive to him than waiting for another round when his money would be worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer in Round 5.

I notice that Bob has only slightly improved his offer to me from Round 2 to Round 4 (from 43 to 44), despite facing increasing inflation. This suggests he's holding firm on wanting a larger share.

However, Bob is now facing approximately 19% inflation compared to Round 1. The longer this negotiation continues, the worse it gets for him due to the 5% compounding inflation per round.

I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining my advantage:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split, which is fair and should be appealing to Bob given his inflation disadvantage. If he rejects this, he'll face even more inflation in the next round, making any future amount worth less to him."
