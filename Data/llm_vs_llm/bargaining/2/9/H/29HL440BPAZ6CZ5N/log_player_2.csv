"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with 40 for me and 60 for you. A fair split to begin. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $60 out of the $100, which is more than half. If I reject and go to the next round, I would be making the offer, but the money would be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

Current offer: I get $60
If I wait one round: Money is worth 80% of current value, so $100 becomes effectively $80 for me

Since Alice is offering me a good deal right away (more than half) and waiting would decrease the value for me, I'll accept this offer.
