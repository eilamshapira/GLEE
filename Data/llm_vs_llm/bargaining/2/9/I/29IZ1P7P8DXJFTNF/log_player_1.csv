"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering Bob $350,000 while I take $650,000. This is a fair offer considering that Bob faces a 20% depreciation with each round, while I don't face any inflation. If he rejects and we go to the next round, his money will be worth less, so it's in his best interest to accept a reasonable offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a more favorable split for Bob compared to my first offer. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, it's rational for him to accept this now. If we continue to later rounds, his share will be worth even less to him. This is a fair compromise that gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging the time pressure he faces."
