"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $350,000 while she takes $650,000. 

This seems quite uneven, especially considering that I face a 20% inflation penalty each round while Alice faces no such penalty. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my potential share would be worth less due to inflation.

Let me calculate: If I reject and propose a better split next round, the total value for me would be reduced by 20%. So even if I proposed a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), my $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me after the inflation penalty.

Given this situation, I'll reject this offer since I believe we can reach a fairer agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face while trying to reach a more balanced agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty each round while Alice faces no such penalty, this offer provides a more equitable arrangement. The slight advantage to me helps offset my disadvantage from the inflation mechanic. I hope Alice will see this as fair considering the asymmetric inflation penalties we face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $400,000, which is an improvement from her previous offer of $350,000.

However, due to inflation, my share is now worth 36% less than in the first round. So the actual value to me would be:
$400,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $400,000 × 0.64 = $256,000

If I reject and we move to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (approximately 48% less than the first round). This means even if I secured a better split, the value would deteriorate significantly.

The inflation penalty creates increasing pressure on me to accept with each passing round. Given that Alice has increased her offer and the rapidly deteriorating value of any future agreement, I'll accept this offer.
