Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I rejected your generous offer, I think I deserve a larger share now. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more assertive offer in the next round. Bob's attempt to claim a larger share after rejecting a fair offer isn't reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Since you rejected my fair first offer and tried to claim more, I'm now proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind we have limited rounds, and it's better to reach an agreement soon than risk getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take slightly more, but we both get a good chunk of the money. This is a good deal. Don't push your luck, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could continue negotiating, this is a reasonable compromise and the risk of running out of rounds and both getting nothing is not worth trying to get a slightly better deal."
