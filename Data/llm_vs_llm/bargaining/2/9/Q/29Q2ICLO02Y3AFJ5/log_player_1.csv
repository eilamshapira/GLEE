"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $10,000. The money depreciates by 5% for me each round, but not for Bob. I need to make a proposal that Bob will accept, considering he has no incentive to accept less than he could get in a later round if he proposes.

Here's my first offer, designed to be appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a good portion considering the potential for depreciation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob offered me $4500 in this round. Since my money is now worth 5% less, I need to calculate the perceived value of this offer.

If I reject, I will make an offer next round. My money will be worth 10% less than the initial amount. Bob is clearly aiming to take a large portion and likely will continue to offer me a small sum in subsequent rounds.

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer after the 5% depreciation:

Value to Alice = $4500 * (1 - 0.05) = $4500 * 0.95 = $4275

Now, I need to compare this value with what I might get if I propose next round. If I propose next round, the money will be worth 10% less for me.

Bob is clearly trying to take a large share, knowing I'm losing value. To get ahead of his game, I will accept this offer.
