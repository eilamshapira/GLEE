"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but inflation means the total money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me). For Alice, it would be worth 10% less (so $900,000 to her).

Given the inflation rates, I should counter-offer if I believe I can get significantly more than $400,000, even accounting for the 5% inflation hit.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation rates and provides a more equitable split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is fair and gives each of us half of the money. Given that Alice faces a higher inflation rate (10% per round) than I do (5% per round), accepting this equal split now would be advantageous for both of us rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. However, due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, which means it's effectively worth about $406,125 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will reduce the value by another 5% for me (total of about 14.75% from round 1), and by another 10% for Alice (total of about 29% from round 1).

Given that Alice improved her offer and the increasing impact of inflation, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
