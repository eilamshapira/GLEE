"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty Bob faces each round. Since I know Bob is rational and understands this, I'll make a fair but strategic first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable 60-40 split that gives Bob a good incentive to accept now rather than wait for the next round where his money would be worth 20% less. If he refuses, his 4000 would effectively be worth only 3200 to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob has proposed the same split I offered (6000 for me, 4000 for him), and it's a fair division. Even though Bob's portion is worth 20% less to him now due to inflation, there's no benefit for me in rejecting this offer since I won't get a better deal by prolonging the game. My share remains at the same value, and I get a solid 60% of the total amount."
