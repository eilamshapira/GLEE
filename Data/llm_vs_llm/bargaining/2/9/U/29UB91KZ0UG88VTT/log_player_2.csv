"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of an even 50-50 split. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and we somehow reach a better deal next round, the maximum I could get would be $90 (if Alice takes only $10), but that would only be worth $81 to me due to 10% inflation.

Since $50 now is better than potentially less later (considering inflation), and the offer is fair, I'll accept.
