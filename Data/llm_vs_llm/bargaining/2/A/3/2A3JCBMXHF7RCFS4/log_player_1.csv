"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I need to propose a split, and the money devalues faster for Bob than for me with each round. I only have 12 rounds. Here's my offer for round 1, aimed at getting Bob to accept while leaving me with a good chunk:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Good Starting Offer:** I'm offering Bob $400,000 right off the bat. This is a significant amount and might be tempting to accept immediately, considering the rapid devaluation for him.
*   **Alice's Advantage:** I'm prioritizing a larger share for myself because the devaluation hurts Bob much more.
*   **Round 1 Importance:** Getting a deal done sooner is crucial because of the limited rounds and the escalating devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and now has proposed a 50/50 split. Importantly, the money is now worth 20% less to Bob than it was in round 1.

Here's my analysis and decision:

*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is now facing the reality of the 20% devaluation. Offering a 50/50 split suggests he recognizes he needs to be more generous to get a deal done.
*   **My Perspective:** While a 50/50 split isn't ideal (I'd prefer more, given the devaluation asymmetry), the money *still* has its full value for me.
*   **Risk Assessment:** If I reject, I risk further devaluation for Bob, which might lead him to make increasingly desperate (and less attractive to me) offers in later rounds. There's also the risk of reaching the 12-round limit and getting nothing.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting this deal gives me $500,000 immediately. Delaying carries risk.

Given these considerations, I will accept Bob's offer.
