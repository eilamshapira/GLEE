"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 45% split, I would get $450,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my baseline for comparison would be $360,000 (80% of $450,000).

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair,"" Alice's 55-45 proposal isn't unreasonable for a first offer. Given that:
1. I'll lose 20% value if I reject
2. We have limited rounds
3. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better counter-offer
4. $450,000 is still a substantial amount

It's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk getting less due to inflation or potential breakdown in negotiations.
