"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My proposal is that I, Alice, receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the importance of reaching an agreement quickly before inflation further diminishes the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
