"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable first offer considering that if we go to the next round, any money I receive will be worth 10% less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer, I'll get $48, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $43.2 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less to me
3. Bob's current offer is actually quite reasonable given the inflation effects
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in the next round
