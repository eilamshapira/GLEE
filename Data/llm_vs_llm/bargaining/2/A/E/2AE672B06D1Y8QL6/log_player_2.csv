"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division reflects the value we each bring. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4000 out of the total $10,000, which is 40% of the money. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value would be worth 10% less to me due to inflation (effectively $9,000 from my perspective). In the next round, I would make the offer.

While I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation, which reduces the value for me even more.

Given that $4000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation effects, I'll accept this offer.
