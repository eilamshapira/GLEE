"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer as Alice, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, dividing the million dollars equally between us. This is a fair starting point that gives us both substantial value."
