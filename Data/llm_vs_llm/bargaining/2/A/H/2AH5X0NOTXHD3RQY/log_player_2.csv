"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a fair offer on the surface
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation
5. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - getting $500,000 now is a guaranteed good outcome
6. Making a greedier counter-offer could lead to a rejection and further rounds of negotiation
7. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given these considerations, I think accepting this fair split in the first round is the best strategy. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later, and this gives me a solid outcome.
