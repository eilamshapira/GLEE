"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. A fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer to divide the $10,000 evenly, giving each of us $5,000.

This is a perfectly fair and balanced first offer that gives us equal shares. In ultimatum games like this, equal splits are generally considered fair by most people, and there's no reason for me to reject it and potentially risk ending up with less in later rounds.
