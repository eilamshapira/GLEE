"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will allow us to avoid the risks of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split is not favorable enough considering my stronger negotiating position (I know my inflation rate is lower than Bob's). Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), I can afford to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial 60-40 split. This 58-42 split is very reasonable, especially considering that your money is losing value faster than mine due to inflation. Let's close this deal now before both of us lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting us both, let's split it down the middle and ensure we both get a fair share before it's too late. A 50-50 split is the most reasonable offer at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given that we're already in round 4 and the inflation is significantly affecting both of us (my potential gains are already worth 27.1% less), accepting a 50-50 split is reasonable. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further value loss and the possibility of ending up with nothing if we reach round 12 makes this a fair compromise to accept now."
