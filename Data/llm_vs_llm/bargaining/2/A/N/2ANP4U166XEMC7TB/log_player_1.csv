"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose that I take $6500 and you take $3500. This way, we'll both come out ahead before inflation becomes a factor. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a fair split would be 50/50 at $5000 each. This way, we both get an equal share and can avoid further rounds of negotiation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
