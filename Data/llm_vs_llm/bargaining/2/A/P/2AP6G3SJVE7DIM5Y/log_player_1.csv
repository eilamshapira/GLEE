"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will try to maximize my gain while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Here's my first proposal, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** I get $5500.
*   **Inflation impact:** I'm unaffected by inflation in this round, so $5500 is worth $5500 to me.
*   **Alternative:** If I reject, I get to make the offer next round, but I don't know how much inflation will affect me or Bob.

Since I'm still receiving a good portion of the original amount and the inflation on my side is being managed, accepting this offer is the best course of action.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
