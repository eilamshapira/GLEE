700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's settle this now so that neither of us suffers further discount losses. By accepting this offer, you secure $300K immediately rather than risk a 20% devaluation in future rounds, while I keep $700K. I believe this is fair given our respective discount rates and the finite rounds. Looking forward to your positive response!",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, considering our discount rates, I believe a 45/55 split is more reflective of our respective risks and rewards. This offer gives us both a significant amount, but also acknowledges the higher discount rate I'm facing. Let's settle on this and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your effort to account for our discount differences, I believe that waiting until round 3—when I'll have the opportunity to propose—will allow me to secure an even better outcome given my much lower devaluation rate. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, accepting this offer now in round 3 means you receive $300000 nominally—which, after your 40% discount at this stage, is effectively worth $180000 in round-1 terms. If you reject, you'll be proposer in round 4 but at a 60% discount, leaving you with even less real value. Given the steep devaluation you'll face if we delay further, this division is solid for you. Let's settle now and avoid sacrificing value.",Alice,3,
