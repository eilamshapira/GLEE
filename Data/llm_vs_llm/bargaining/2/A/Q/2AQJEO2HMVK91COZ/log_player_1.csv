"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that's fair considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let me explain my proposal: Since I face a 5% reduction in value each round we delay, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you 40% of the total, which is generous while ensuring I'm protected against the inflation penalty I uniquely face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
