"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. Given that:
1. Money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
2. Money loses 10% value for Alice each round
3. I can make a counter-offer next round

If I reject, in the next round Alice's maximum value will be worth 10% less to her. This means I can potentially negotiate a better deal, as 6000$ will only be worth 5400$ to her next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since money loses 10% value each round for Alice but not for me, I can leverage this to get a better deal. The 6000$ she wanted in round 1 is now only worth 5400$ to her. I should offer her enough to make it worthwhile compared to waiting another round, but still get a better deal for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fairer than the original offer. For Alice, rejecting this would mean her next potential gains would be worth even less to her due to the 10% depreciation per round. This is a reasonable offer that she should accept to avoid further value loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from 4000$ to 4500$
2. The 5500$ she wants is actually worth only 4455$ to her (5500$ * 0.81) due to the 19% depreciation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth 29% less than the first round
4. I still have many rounds left and my money doesn't depreciate

While this is a better offer than her first one, I can still get a better deal by rejecting. As the rounds progress, Alice's urgency to make a deal will increase due to her increasing depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

At this point, any money Alice gets is worth only 71% of its original value to her (after 29% depreciation). I can use this to make an offer that appears larger to me but is actually less valuable to her due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This means:
- I get 6000$
- Alice gets 4000$, which is worth only 2840$ to her due to the 29% depreciation
- If she rejects, her next potential gains will be worth even less (39% depreciation)
- This offer gives her a strong incentive to accept before her potential gains depreciate further
- Yet it's still better for me than accepting her previous offer of 4500$"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering a 50-50 split
2. For me: I get 5000$ at full value
3. For Alice: Her 5000$ is only worth 3280.50$ (5000$ * 0.6561) due to 34.39% depreciation
4. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 44% less than the first round
5. I still have 7 rounds left and my money doesn't depreciate

While this is a better offer than her previous ones, the depreciation is working strongly in my favor. Her 5000$ is already worth much less to her than my 5000$ is to me. By rejecting, I can likely get an even better deal as her urgency increases due to depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, strategic pressure is really building on Alice:
- Any money she gets is worth only about 56% of its original value (after ~44% depreciation)
- If she rejects this offer, her next potential gains will be worth even less
- We're halfway through our rounds, increasing pressure to make a deal

Given these factors, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

Rationale:
- I get 7000$ at full value
- Alice gets 3000$, which due to depreciation is worth about 1680$ to her
- If she rejects, her next gains will depreciate even further
- The diminishing value of money to her makes this more likely to be accepted than in earlier rounds
- We're approaching a point where the depreciation makes any delay very costly for her"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 5500$ (at full value)
2. She wants 4500$, which is only worth 2391.30$ to her (4500$ * 0.5314) due to 46.86% depreciation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 52% less than the first round
4. We still have 5 rounds left and my money doesn't depreciate

Even though Alice has improved her offer to me (5500$ is the best she's offered so far), the strong depreciation effect means I can likely get an even better deal by rejecting. Her urgency to make a deal should be quite high now as her potential gains are worth less than half of their nominal value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, the strategic situation is very favorable for me:
- Any money Alice gets is worth only about 48% of its original value (after ~52% depreciation)
- We're now 2/3 through our rounds
- Alice has shown willingness to increase my share over time
- Her last offer gave me 5500$, showing she's becoming more willing to accept a larger share for me

Given these factors, I'll make an aggressive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

Rationale:
- I get 8000$ at full value
- Alice gets 2000$, which due to depreciation is worth only about 960$ to her
- If she rejects, her next gains will depreciate even further (to about 42% of original value)
- The time pressure and severe depreciation make this more likely to be accepted than in earlier rounds
- Even if she rejects, this establishes a strong negotiating position for future rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 6000$ (at full value)
2. She wants 4000$, which is only worth 1722$ to her (4000$ * 0.4305) due to 56.95% depreciation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 61% less than the first round
4. We have 3 rounds left and my money doesn't depreciate
5. This is the best offer she's made so far (6000$)

While this is her best offer yet, we're in the final quarter of negotiations and her money is worth less than half its original value. Given that she's shown willingness to increase my share significantly (from 4000$ initially to 6000$ now), and there are still 3 rounds left, I believe I can get an even better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in a critical phase:
- Only 2 rounds would remain after this
- Alice's money is worth only about 39% of its original value (after ~61% depreciation)
- She's shown willingness to offer me 6000$ in the last round
- The threat of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds is becoming very real

I'll make a strong but not extreme offer:

{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500}

Rationale:
- I get 8500$ at full value
- Alice gets 1500$, which due to depreciation is worth about 585$ to her
- If she rejects, her money will depreciate even further in the next round
- With only 2 rounds remaining after this, the risk of getting nothing becomes a serious concern
- This offer is better than zero (which we'll both get if we don't agree within 12 rounds)
- I'm leaving her enough that it's still worth accepting given the severe depreciation and time pressure"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully as we're now in the penultimate round:

1. Alice is offering me 6500$ (at full value)
2. She wants 3500$, which is only worth 1220.45$ to her (3500$ * 0.3487) due to 65.13% depreciation
3. Only one round remains after this
4. If we don't agree by the end of round 12, we both get nothing

Crucial considerations:
- This is Alice's best offer yet (6500$)
- The risk of getting nothing is very real with only one round left
- In the next round, her money will be worth even less
- However, I would have one last chance to make an offer

Given that we're so close to the end and Alice has consistently rejected my higher demands, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing. While I might be able to get more in the final round, the risk of total failure is too high.
