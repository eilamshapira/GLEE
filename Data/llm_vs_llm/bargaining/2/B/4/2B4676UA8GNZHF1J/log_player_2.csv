"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me as I'm making the first move, but it's still quite fair. Let's avoid losing value through inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $4,500 out of the $10,000, which is 45% of the total. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will decrease by 20% to $8,000.

While her offer isn't an even split, it's relatively reasonable given she's making the first move. If I reject and we continue negotiating through multiple rounds, inflation will significantly reduce our total earnings.
