"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the future inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that starting with a slightly more favorable split for myself gives me a good starting point, while still offering Bob a significant amount. The inflation will start impacting Bob's potential earnings more quickly."
