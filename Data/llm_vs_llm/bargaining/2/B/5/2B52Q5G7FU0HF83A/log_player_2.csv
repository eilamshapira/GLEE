"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 equallyâ€”$5000 each. I believe this fair division sets a positive tone for our negotiations. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal of splitting the $10000 equally.

A 50-50 split ($5000 each) is perfectly fair and aligns with principles of equality. This is generally considered a reasonable division in such scenarios, and it allows both of us to benefit equally from the available funds.

Since this is a fair offer right from the start, and there's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me, I'll accept this proposal.
