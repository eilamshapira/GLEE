"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fairly generous offer to Bob to encourage acceptance and avoid a lengthy negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. It's a perfectly fair 50-50 split, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds. Plus, prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of reaching round 12 without agreement, where we both get nothing.
