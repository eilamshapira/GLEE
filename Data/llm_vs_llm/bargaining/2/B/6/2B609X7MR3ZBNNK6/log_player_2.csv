"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing to take a slightly larger share ($55) while giving me $45. While this isn't an even split, it's fairly close to 50-50, and dragging out negotiations could risk both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

However, since this is the first round and I have several more opportunities to negotiate, I think I can try for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a perfectly even split, which is the most fair solution for both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money evenly, $50 each."
