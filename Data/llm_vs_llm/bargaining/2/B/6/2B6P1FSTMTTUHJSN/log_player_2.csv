"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, this gives us both roughly equal value if we consider the time value of money. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose significant value. Let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,""alice_gain"": 5000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your perspective on inflation and the need for a swift decision. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This way, we can both benefit equally and avoid any potential losses from delay.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for an even 50-50 split, but we need to account for our different inflation rates. You only lose 10% per round while I lose 20% per round. This 58-42 split compensates for that difference and creates a fair outcome in terms of real value for both of us. If we continue to next rounds, we'll both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800,""alice_gain"": 5200,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation. I'm proposing a 48-52 split in your favor. This acknowledges your higher inflation rate while still giving me a fair share. Let's work together to reach a deal before we lose more value.""}"
