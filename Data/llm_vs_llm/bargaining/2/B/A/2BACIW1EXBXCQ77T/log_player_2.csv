"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, which is 40% of the money. If I reject, I get to make an offer next round, but the total money will be worth 10% less (so $9,000 total).

This isn't an equal split, but it's still a substantial amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and we could lose more value to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that gives us a more balanced split while acknowledging that we've already lost 10% to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $5,000, which is fair and reasonable. The total value has already decreased by 10% because we've moved to round 2, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further."
