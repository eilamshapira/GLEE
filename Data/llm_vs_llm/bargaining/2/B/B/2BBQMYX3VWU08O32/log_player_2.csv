"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
- That's a 40/60 split in her favor
- If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer
- However, the total value will decrease by 20% to $800,000
- I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject
- $400,000 is still a substantial amount

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the 20% loss in value. I'll reject this offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a 55/45 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal while giving me a better position. This still leaves Alice with a substantial $450,000, showing I'm willing to be fair but also want a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- Alice is offering me $420,000, but with 36% inflation, it's effectively worth about $268,800
- She's made a small improvement from her first offer ($400,000)
- If I reject, we move to round 4 with 44% total inflation
- We've already used 3 rounds out of 12
- The trend suggests Alice might be willing to negotiate further
- However, continuing to reject offers means significant value loss

While I believe I could potentially get a better deal, the increasing inflation is becoming a serious concern. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk further depreciation.
