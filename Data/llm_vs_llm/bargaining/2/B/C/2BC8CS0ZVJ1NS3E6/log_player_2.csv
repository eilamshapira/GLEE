"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully:
* It's a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
* If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where the total value drops by 20% to $80
* Even if I made a more favorable proposal in round 2, Alice could reject it
* A fair split in the first round is better than risking value loss
* This maximizes our collective outcome
