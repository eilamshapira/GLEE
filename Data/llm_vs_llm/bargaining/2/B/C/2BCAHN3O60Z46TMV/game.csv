600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial $400000 while acknowledging that delay hurts me more due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go to round 2, the total value drops to $950000 for me, making this a fair first-round offer.",Alice,1,
