"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll play as Alice in this game. In the first round, I need to make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial $400,000 while acknowledging that delay hurts me more due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go to round 2, the total value drops to $950,000 for me, making this a fair first-round offer.""}"
