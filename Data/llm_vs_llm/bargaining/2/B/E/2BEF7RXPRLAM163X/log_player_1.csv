Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we're just getting started and still have plenty of opportunities, I'd like to propose a 60/40 split. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep things fair and simple.  A 50/50 split seems most reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
