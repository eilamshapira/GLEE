"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round and you're not, this split is fair. I get 52% and you get 48%, which protects both of us from losing value through extended negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
