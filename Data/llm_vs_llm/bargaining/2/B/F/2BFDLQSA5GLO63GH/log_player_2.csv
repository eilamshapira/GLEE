"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) and keeping $6,000 (60%)
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * I can make my own proposal
   * But Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more depreciation

Since this is the first round and Alice's opening offer takes 60% for herself, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal. Even with the 5% depreciation, I should be able to negotiate for a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, acknowledging that I'm affected by inflation while Alice isn't:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round and you're not, this split is fair. I get 52% and you get 48%, which protects both of us from losing value through extended negotiations.""}"
