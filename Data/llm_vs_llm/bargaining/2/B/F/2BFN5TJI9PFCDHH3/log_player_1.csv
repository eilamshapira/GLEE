"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair division considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing you get $5,500 and I take $4,500. Since I face 10% inflation with each round, I need to secure a slightly higher amount now. This is still a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I now understand that Bob is facing even higher inflation than I am. Let me adjust my offer to be more appealing while still accounting for my inflation concerns.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. Since we're now in round 3, the money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1, and the money Bob receives is worth 40% less than in round 1. This fair 50-50 split acknowledges both our inflation constraints while being equitable."
