"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this proposal.

Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000. This is a fair and equitable division.

While I could reject and make my own offer in the next round, there's no inflation affecting my value (0% mentioned in the rules), so the money won't increase in value for me by waiting. Additionally, if I make a more aggressive offer in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds of negotiation.

Given that this is a perfectly fair split and there's no strategic advantage for me to wait, I'll accept this offer.
