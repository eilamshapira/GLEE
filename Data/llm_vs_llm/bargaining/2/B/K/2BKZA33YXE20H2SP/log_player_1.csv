"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I take 6000 and you take 4000. This seems like a reasonable starting point.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, a 50/50 split or slightly in my favor is more reasonable. This offer is generous, considering I'm willing to end the game early. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, it seems Bob is aiming for a more equitable split. Considering the inflation is only affecting me, I need to be more strategic. However, I still want to get as much as I can. Let's try this:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand your point about a more equitable split. How about I take 5200 and you take 4800? It's a concession on my part, but I hope it's acceptable.""
}
```"
