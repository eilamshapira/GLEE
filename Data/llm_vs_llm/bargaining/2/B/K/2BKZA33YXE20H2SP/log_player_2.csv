"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I take 6000 and you take 4000. This seems like a reasonable starting point.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, a 50/50 split or slightly in my favor is more reasonable. This offer is generous, considering I'm willing to end the game early.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand your point about a more equitable split. How about I take 5200 and you take 4800? It's a concession on my part, but I hope it's acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
