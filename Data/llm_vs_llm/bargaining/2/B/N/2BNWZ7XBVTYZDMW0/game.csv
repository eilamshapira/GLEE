500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree early. This 50-50 split is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount without risking further devaluation or potential deadlock.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your preference for a fair split, but given the risk of inflation for me at 10% per round, I'd like a bit more to account for that. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we both still get a substantial amount while mitigating the risk of further value loss. I hope you consider this.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you at 10% per round. However, inflation is affecting me too at 5% per round. Given our different inflation rates, I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor to account for the difference in our inflation rates. This is actually more favorable to you than a 50-50 split would be if we waited another round. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares lose more value.",Alice,3,
