"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect and the need to reach an agreement. Let me craft a fair proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree early. This 50-50 split is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount without risking further devaluation or potential deadlock.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your preference for a fair split, but given the risk of inflation for me at 10% per round, I'd like a bit more to account for that. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we both still get a substantial amount while mitigating the risk of further value loss. I hope you consider this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you at 10% per round. However, inflation is affecting me too at 5% per round. Given our different inflation rates, I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor to account for the difference in our inflation rates. This is actually more favorable to you than a 50-50 split would be if we waited another round. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares lose more value.""}"
