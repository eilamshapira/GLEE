"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair and takes into account that we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which gives us each $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally, and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without risking further rounds where we might both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is looking for a larger share. Let me propose a compromise that's more favorable to him than my original offer, but still fair to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing that Bob receives $550,000 and I receive $450,000. This gives Bob a majority of the money while still being reasonable for me. Given that inflation is affecting Bob's gains with each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement soon, and this offer moves significantly in Bob's direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is consistently pushing for a larger share, and with the inflation affecting his gains, I understand his motivation. Let me propose a more favorable offer for him while still maintaining a reasonable outcome for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob $600,000, which matches what he asked for in round 2, while I would receive $400,000. This represents a significant concession from my initial position and should demonstrate my willingness to reach a fair compromise. With the inflation factor already at 14.26% for Bob, reaching an agreement now would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing to later rounds."
