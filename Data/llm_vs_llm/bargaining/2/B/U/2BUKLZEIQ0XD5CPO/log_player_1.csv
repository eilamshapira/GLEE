"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and it ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty each round and you don't, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement now rather than continuing negotiations where the total value decreases for me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
