"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous 2000$. Let's end this quickly and secure some money! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She's proposing I take $2000 while she keeps $8000. Since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round, I need to consider the future value of money.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be 10000 × 0.95 = $9500. In round 3, it would be 10000 × 0.95² = $9025, and so on.

This first offer gives me only 20% of the pot, which seems quite low given we're just starting negotiations. I believe I can secure a better deal, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I face.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and it ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty each round and you don't, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement now rather than continuing negotiations where the total value decreases for me.""}"
