Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally. Remember that delays hurt me more than you due to inflation, but this split is fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
