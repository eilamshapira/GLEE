"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's get this done quickly. Take this generous offer and let's move on! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $1,000 is far too low, considering we're splitting $10,000. Even with the 20% depreciation per round, I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round that would be better for both parties. A 90-10 split heavily favors Alice and isn't fair."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
