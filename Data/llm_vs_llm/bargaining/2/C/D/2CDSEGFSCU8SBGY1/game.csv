40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation affects you but not me, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. However, I'd prefer we resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $40 and $60 for me, which is fair considering the inflation dynamics. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will decrease due to the 10% inflation you face each round.",Bob,2,
