"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 55,

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a good starting point and we can avoid losing value to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation affects you but not me, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. However, I'd prefer we resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $40 and $60 for me, which is fair considering the inflation dynamics. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will decrease due to the 10% inflation you face each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
