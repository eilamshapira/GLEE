"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a good starting point and we can avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair, given the inflation factors for both of us.

In this game, my money doesn't lose value with each round (0% inflation for me), but Alice faces 10% inflation per round. This means waiting is more costly for Alice than for me.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. Alice's position will weaken over time due to her inflation penalty, which gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation dynamics while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation affects you but not me, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. However, I'd prefer we resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $40 and $60 for me, which is fair considering the inflation dynamics. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will decrease due to the 10% inflation you face each round.""}"
