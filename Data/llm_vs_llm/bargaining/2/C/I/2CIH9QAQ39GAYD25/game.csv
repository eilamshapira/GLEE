6000.0,4000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering the time pressure you face due to inflation affecting your share.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"I'm feeling generous! I'm offering a slightly better split than your previous offer. Inflation is hitting me harder, so take it or leave it!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Given that inflation has already reduced your purchasing power by 10% over two rounds, you should accept this offer now. If we continue, your share will be worth even less to you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright, let's be fair. A 50/50 split. Take it, before I lose even more to this darn inflation!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, inflation has now reduced your purchasing power by nearly 20%. This $3000 offer is actually worth only about $2400 to you now, and it will be worth even less if you reject. This is your best option at this point.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Last offer, Alice. Take it or I walk away with nothing. Inflation is killing me! 45/55, final.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, your purchasing power has been reduced by over 27% now. This $2500 is worth about $1825 to you, while getting nothing is worth zero. Further delays will only reduce your value more. This is your best remaining option - please accept.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Alice, I'm starting to feel the pinch. Let's settle on a 40/60 split. This is the last chance. Don't make me regret this.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, inflation has reduced your purchasing power by over 35% now. This $2000 offer is worth about $1300 to you - still much better than nothing. The next round will only decrease your value further. Please be rational and accept this offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Alright, Alice, I'm going to lose a significant amount if we keep going. This is my final, final offer. Take 3500 or I'm out. I can't keep bleeding money like this. Please accept!",Bob,10,
