"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous! I'm offering a slightly better split than your previous offer. Inflation is hitting me harder, so take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,750, which is less than my initial proposal of $6,000
2. Due to 5% inflation, Bob's $5,250 is actually worth $4,987.50 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - My money maintains its value
4. I have a stronger negotiating position due to inflation not affecting me
