"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair proposition that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my role as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and there's no favoritism. Considering the effect of inflation, it's better to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. While Bob is affected by inflation, I'm not, so my $500,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, we'll enter round 3, and we risk further rounds where:
   - The total amount could be lost if we reach round 12 without agreement
   - Bob's future offers might be less favorable as he tries to compensate for inflation
   - Bob might become less cooperative if I reject a fair offer
The 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, and getting the deal done early is advantageous."
