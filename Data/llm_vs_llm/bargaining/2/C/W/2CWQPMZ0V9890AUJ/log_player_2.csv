Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair proposition that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my role as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and there's no favoritism. Considering the effect of inflation, it's better to agree sooner rather than later.""}"
