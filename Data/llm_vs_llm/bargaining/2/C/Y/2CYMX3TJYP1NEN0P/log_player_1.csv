"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering you $4800, Bob, which is slightly less than half, but reasonable given that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). If we go to another round, we both risk getting less value. This is a fair first offer that acknowledges our different situations."
