"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer considering the inflation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** Alice proposes $4800 for me and $5200 for herself.

*   **Inflation:** The money is worth 20% less for me this round. That means the $4800 is effectively worth $4800 * (1 - 0.20) = $3840 to me right now.

*   **Considering the Alternative:** If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the total value will be further reduced. My goal is to decide whether what I would receive here ($3840) is a better option than the discounted total value I can get when I'm on turn.

Now let us consider what happens if I reject. The value of the money will be worth 20% less.
So now, the amount of money we have is 10000- 10000*0.2 = 8000 to me. Alice's worth is reduced by 10%
So, the value of money to Alice is 10000-10000*0.1=9000
Therefore, with this information, I must make a decision. 3840 seems like a safe amount. I would take it.
