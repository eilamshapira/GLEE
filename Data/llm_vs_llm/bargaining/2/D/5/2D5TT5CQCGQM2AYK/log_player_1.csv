"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's fair enough that Bob might accept it, considering that if he refuses, the total amount will decrease by 10% in the next round. A rejection would mean we'd only have $900,000 to split in round 2, which could leave us both worse off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000
- If I reject, we move to round 3 where the total amount will be worth another 10% less ($900,000 â†’ $810,000)
- Even if I could get a larger share in round 3, the absolute value might be less due to inflation
- Bob's offer is reasonable - it's basically the reverse of what I offered
- Getting $450,000 now is better than risking further devaluation
