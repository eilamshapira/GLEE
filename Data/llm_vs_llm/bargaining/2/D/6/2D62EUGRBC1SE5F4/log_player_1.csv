"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I know I face 20% inflation per round, I'm suggesting a division that gives me a favorable portion while still offering Bob a substantial amount. This seems fair given the time pressure I face from inflation."
