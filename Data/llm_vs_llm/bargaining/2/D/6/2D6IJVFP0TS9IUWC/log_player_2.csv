"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's go for a fair split. I propose $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Let's wrap this up early and enjoy our shares! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's initial offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000. That's not an equal division - she's asking for a 60/40 split in her favor.

Since we're only in the first round and have plenty of rounds left, I think I can pursue a more equitable distribution.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a perfectly equal split would be fairest for both of us. I'm proposing we each get $500,000 - a true 50/50 division. This way we both walk away with the same substantial amount.""}"
