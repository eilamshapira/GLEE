"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than letting inflation eat into both our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is too unfavorable for me. Even accounting for inflation, I can make a better offer in the next round. Since my inflation rate (10%) is lower than Bob's (20%), I can afford to be a bit patient."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3, I'll adjust my offer slightly. I need to account for the fact that my share is worth 20% less than in round 1 (10% per round), and Bob's share is worth 36% less than in round 1 (20% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. This is more favorable to Bob than my first offer, while still giving me a reasonable share. Given the accelerating impact of inflation (especially on Bob's side), this should be an attractive offer to accept."
