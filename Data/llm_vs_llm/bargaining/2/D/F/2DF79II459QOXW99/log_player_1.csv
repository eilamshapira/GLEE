"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting Alice and Bob. Since I have a higher inflation penalty (20% vs 5%), I should aim for a favorable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair 60-40 split that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting. If he declines, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth significantly less due to the 20% inflation penalty per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With 20% inflation for me, $4500 is now worth effectively $3600 (4500 * 0.8)
2. For Bob, with 5% inflation, $5500 is worth $5225 (5500 * 0.95)

If I reject, next round I can make an offer but:
- I'll face another 20% reduction (making each dollar worth 0.64 of original value)
- Bob will face only 5% more reduction (making each dollar worth 0.9 of original value)

While this offer isn't ideal, the rapidly increasing inflation penalty for me makes it risky to reject. The difference in our inflation rates means my negotiating position weakens much faster than Bob's.
