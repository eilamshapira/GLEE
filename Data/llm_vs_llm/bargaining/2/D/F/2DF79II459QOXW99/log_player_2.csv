"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet. 
Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself.

While this isn't an even split, I have to consider:
1. If I reject, any future money will be worth 5% less to me
2. Alice's money devalues faster (20% per round)
3. We have a limited number of rounds (12)

I can probably get a better deal by making a counter-offer, and the larger inflation impact on Alice's side gives me some negotiating leverage.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that money now has 5% less value for me and 20% less value for Alice in this round, I should make a strategic offer.

Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine, she has more incentive to accept a deal sooner rather than later. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk a rejection.

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a modest advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it, considering her faster devaluation rate."
