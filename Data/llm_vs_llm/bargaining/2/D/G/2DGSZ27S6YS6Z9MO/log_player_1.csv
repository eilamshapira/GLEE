"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid inflation affecting the total value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the impact of inflation on your share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer considers the urgency to settle and still provides you with a significant portion despite the decreasing value of money for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. Due to 5% inflation, my $4500 is now worth $4275 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob knows I'm affected by inflation and has leverage to make increasingly unfavorable offers
4. The current split is reasonable given the circumstances
5. Further negotiation will likely result in worse outcomes for me due to the inflation penalty"
