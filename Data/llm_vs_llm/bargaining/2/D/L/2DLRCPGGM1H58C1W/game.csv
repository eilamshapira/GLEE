5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the $10000 equally right away—$5000 each. This fair division helps us both get the full value immediately, avoiding any potential loss from waiting.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, your offer gives me $4500, which is less than I aimed for. Considering that my money still holds full value while yours is already discounted by 20%, I believe I can propose a division in the next round that better reflects our interests. I’m rejecting your current proposal.",Alice,2,reject
3200.0,6800.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the inflation bite on your share deepens—every round you lose another 20% in effective value. By accepting this proposal, you get $6800 nominally, which at this stage is effectively worth about $4080, while I keep a stable $3200. If you wait until round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat but with an even steeper discount (roughly 40% off), likely leaving you with less effective value. I believe this offer gives you a better immediate outcome than the risky future. I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,3,
