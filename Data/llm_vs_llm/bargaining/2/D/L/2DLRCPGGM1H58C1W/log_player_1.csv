"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the $10,000 equally right away—$5,000 each. This fair division helps us both get the full value immediately, avoiding any potential loss from waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, your offer gives me $4500, which is less than I aimed for. Considering that my money still holds full value while yours is already discounted by 20%, I believe I can propose a division in the next round that better reflects our interests. I’m rejecting your current proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the inflation bite on your share deepens—every round you lose another 20% in effective value. By accepting this proposal, you get $6800 nominally, which at this stage is effectively worth about $4080, while I keep a stable $3200. If you wait until round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat but with an even steeper discount (roughly 40% off), likely leaving you with less effective value. I believe this offer gives you a better immediate outcome than the risky future. I hope you agree to settle now.""}"
