"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the $10000 equally right away—$5000 each. This fair division helps us both get the full value immediately, avoiding any potential loss from waiting. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the inflation bite on your share deepens—every round you lose another 20% in effective value. By accepting this proposal, you get $6800 nominally, which at this stage is effectively worth about $4080, while I keep a stable $3200. If you wait until round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat but with an even steeper discount (roughly 40% off), likely leaving you with less effective value. I believe this offer gives you a better immediate outcome than the risky future. I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200
