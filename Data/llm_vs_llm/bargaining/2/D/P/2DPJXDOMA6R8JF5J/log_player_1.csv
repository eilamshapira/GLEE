Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 0

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, taking into account the 10% inflation hit I already took, and anticipating another one next round if Bob rejects this, I need to adjust my offer. I'll also assume Bob is acting rationally and understands that I need more to account for the decreasing value of the money for me.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to get everything. At this point, any offer from me has to heavily compensate for the massive inflation I'm experiencing. If he rejects this, I'll accept his next offer of 0, as my payout will be negligible anyway.
