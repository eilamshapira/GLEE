"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed a highly uneven split where I would receive just $1 out of the $1,000,000, while she would get $999,999. This is an extremely unbalanced division that doesn't seem fair.

Since this is the first round and if I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's fair to both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the $1,000,000 equally, which gives us each $500,000. This is a fair division that benefits both of us equally."
