"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in future rounds, and you lose less than I do with each delay (10% vs 20%).""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering we both lose value, and you lose at a higher rate. Let's avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. My effective gain if I accept: $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 (due to 20% inflation)
2. Bob's effective gain if I accept: $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 (due to 10% inflation)

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 20% less for Bob)
- I might not get a better deal, and we'll both lose more value

Given that:
1. Bob's counter-offer is reasonable
2. Further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us
3. I'm losing value faster than Bob
