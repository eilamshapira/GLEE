2857.0,7143.0,"Alice, given the cost of delay for both of us (with my money depreciating by 10% per round and yours by 20%), the fair‐bargaining equilibrium in our alternating-offer framework suggests that I should secure about 5/7 of the pie and you 2/7. In other words, I propose that I get $7143 and you get $2857. Accepting this offer now maximizes both our returns compared to prolonging the negotiation. What do you think?",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable here.  We both lose a lot with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  Accept this and we can both move on.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, considering how rapidly the value erodes with each round (my funds lose about 10% value per round and yours 20%), your 50/50 split now effectively gives me $5000 × 0.81 = $4050 in real value. If I reject and wait for the next round when I'll be the proposer, my bargaining power is diminished by further discounting (my funds would then be worth only about 0.729 of their nominal value), which would force me to make a much less favorable proposal for myself. In light of that, I accept your offer so we both secure as much value as possible.",Bob,3,accept
