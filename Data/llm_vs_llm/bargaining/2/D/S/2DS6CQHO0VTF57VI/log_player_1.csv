"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the cost of delay for both of us (with my money depreciating by 10% per round and yours by 20%), the fair‚Äêbargaining equilibrium in our alternating-offer framework suggests that I should secure about 5/7 of the pie and you 2/7. In other words, I propose that I get $7143 and you get $2857. Accepting this offer now maximizes both our returns compared to prolonging the negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
