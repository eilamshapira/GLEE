"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I think this is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Alice, given the cost of delay for both of us (with my money depreciating by 10% per round and yours by 20%), the fair‐bargaining equilibrium in our alternating-offer framework suggests that I should secure about 5/7 of the pie and you 2/7. In other words, I propose that I get $7,143 and you get $2,857. Accepting this offer now maximizes both our returns compared to prolonging the negotiation. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here.  We both lose a lot with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, considering how rapidly the value erodes with each round (my funds lose about 10% value per round and yours 20%), your 50/50 split now effectively gives me $5,000 × 0.81 = $4,050 in real value. If I reject and wait for the next round when I'll be the proposer, my bargaining power is diminished by further discounting (my funds would then be worth only about 0.729 of their nominal value), which would force me to make a much less favorable proposal for myself. In light of that, I accept your offer so we both secure as much value as possible.""}"
