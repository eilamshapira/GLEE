"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly and avoid inflation impacts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Inflation is hurting me, and this offer reflects a desire for a quick agreement. It's better for both of us than continuing to lose value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. For me (Alice), $45 is still worth $45 since inflation doesn't affect me
2. For Bob, $55 is actually worth $49.5 due to 10% inflation
3. If I reject and we go to another round, Bob's value will decrease further
4. This means I could potentially get a better deal in the next round
5. However, there's also a risk of prolonging negotiations

Given that I could likely get a better deal in the next round as Bob's position weakens due to inflation, and that my original ask was for $60:

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the inflation affecting you, this 65-35 split is actually fair. Your $35 now is worth about $31.5 to you, but delaying further will only reduce your value more. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is affecting me, but 50-50 is still the fairest split. Let's just end this with an even distribution before the money loses even more value. This is a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For me (Alice), $50 is worth $50 (no inflation impact)
2. For Bob, $50 is actually worth only $36.45 (due to 27.1% inflation)
3. Bob's position is significantly weaker now due to compounding inflation
4. If I reject, I could potentially get an even better deal next round
5. However, this offer is better than Bob's previous offer of $45

While I could potentially get more in the next round, $50 is a reasonable amount and there's always a risk in continuing negotiations. The difference between this and my last proposal ($65) isn't worth the risk of further rounds.
