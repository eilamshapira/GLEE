  ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Inflation is hurting me, and this offer reflects a desire for a quick agreement. It's better for both of us than continuing to lose value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the inflation affecting you, this 65-35 split is actually fair. Your $35 now is worth about $31.5 to you, but delaying further will only reduce your value more. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
