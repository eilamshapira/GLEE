264908.0,735092.0,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $264908 and you get $735092. I’ve worked backwards considering our time‐preferences. If you reject and get to propose in Round 2, your effective value will still be about $735092 (since every round you lose 5% of the nominal amount while mine remain full value). In other words, waiting won’t improve your position, so it’s best we agree now. What do you say?",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your reasoning, but I think a more balanced split is fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes the time pressure but also allows us both to benefit significantly.",Bob,2,

321708.0,678292.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my Round 3 proposal. Based on our remaining rounds and the fact that your money is discounted by 10% in this round while mine isn’t discounted at all, I’ve worked backwards to make an offer that leaves you exactly as well‐off as if you were to reject and propose in Round 4. Specifically, if you rejected this offer, you’d get to propose in the next round where—after accounting for a 15% devaluation on your share—you’d end up with an effective payoff of roughly $610463. In order for you to be indifferent between accepting now and waiting, my proposal gives you a nominal $678292 (which is worth about $610463 to you in Round 3) while I receive $321708. I believe this division respects both the time pressures and our future prospects. What do you say?",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you laying out your logic, but I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. I propose 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage considering the time pressure, but it's much closer to a fair deal.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I must reject it because while a 55/45 split gives me $450000 now, if I wait until Round 5 as the proposer—the fact that your share continues to be discounted further means I can secure a distribution that’s even more favorable to me in nominal terms. I believe it’s in my best interest to hold out for a proposal where I can capture nearly the entire value, given the dramatic impact of inflation on your share in later rounds. Looking forward to our continued negotiations.",Alice,4,reject
386000.0,614000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my Round 5 proposal. In this round, remember that while my share remains at full value, your money is discounted by a factor of 0.95⁴ (about 81.45% of its nominal value). My offer gives you a nominal $614000—which translates to an effective value of roughly $614000 × 0.8145 ≈ $500000. This effective amount is exactly what you could expect if you waited until Round 6 to propose, given the further discounting that would occur then. In short, by accepting this proposal, you secure an effective payoff equal to your continuation value. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound offer for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",Alice,5,
