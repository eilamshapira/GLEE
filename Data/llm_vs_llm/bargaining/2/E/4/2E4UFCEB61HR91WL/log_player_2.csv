"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $264908 and you get $735092. I’ve worked backwards considering our time‐preferences. If you reject and get to propose in Round 2, your effective value will still be about $735092 (since every round you lose 5% of the nominal amount while mine remain full value). In other words, waiting won’t improve your position, so it’s best we agree now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 735092 
# Alice gain: 264908 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's think about this. Alice is right that if the game goes to round 2, my potential gain is reduced by 5% due to the ""inflation.""  However, I can propose a counter offer that gives us both a more balanced share. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than her initial offer, but not that much smaller.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your reasoning, but I think a more balanced split is fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes the time pressure but also allows us both to benefit significantly.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my Round 3 proposal. Based on our remaining rounds and the fact that your money is discounted by 10% in this round while mine isn’t discounted at all, I’ve worked backwards to make an offer that leaves you exactly as well‐off as if you were to reject and propose in Round 4. Specifically, if you rejected this offer, you’d get to propose in the next round where—after accounting for a 15% devaluation on your share—you’d end up with an effective payoff of roughly $610463. In order for you to be indifferent between accepting now and waiting, my proposal gives you a nominal $678292 (which is worth about $610463 to you in Round 3) while I receive $321708. I believe this division respects both the time pressures and our future prospects. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 678292 
# Alice gain: 321708 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to use some clever math to convince me this is a good deal, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  While she's technically correct about the future value calculations, waiting for even one more round significantly disadvantages me.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you laying out your logic, but I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. I propose 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage considering the time pressure, but it's much closer to a fair deal.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my Round 5 proposal. In this round, remember that while my share remains at full value, your money is discounted by a factor of 0.95⁴ (about 81.45% of its nominal value). My offer gives you a nominal $614000—which translates to an effective value of roughly $614000 × 0.8145 ≈ $500000. This effective amount is exactly what you could expect if you waited until Round 6 to propose, given the further discounting that would occur then. In short, by accepting this proposal, you secure an effective payoff equal to your continuation value. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound offer for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 614000 
# Alice gain: 386000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is getting closer to a reasonable split, but she's still using the threat of future devaluation to justify taking a larger share now. I need to consider if holding out is worth the risk.  While a 50/50 split is ideal, I need to be realistic about the diminishing returns.
