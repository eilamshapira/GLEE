"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the 20% decrease for me.

In Round 1, the total amount is $1,000,000, and Alice offers me $300,000 while keeping $700,000 for herself.

Given that the money decreases by 20% for me with each round, if I reject this offer, the total amount for me in the next round would be worth 80% of $1,000,000, which is $800,000. However, this decrease only affects my perception of the value, not the actual amount I could propose or accept in subsequent rounds.

Considering this, accepting $300,000 now might be less favorable than trying to negotiate a better split, especially since the decrease in value affects me directly and could significantly impact my potential earnings in later rounds.

Therefore, my decision is:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer and we're moving to Round 2, I need to make a strategic decision. Since the value of the money decreases by 20% for me with each round, I should aim to get the best possible deal now, considering the diminishing value.

However, I also need to make an offer that Alice might find reasonable to accept, given that she doesn't suffer from the value decrease.

For Round 2, considering the 20% decrease in value for me, the effective amount I'm negotiating over is 80% of $1,000,000, which is $800,000. But since Alice's valuation doesn't decrease, I should propose a split based on the original $1,000,000 to maximize my potential gain while being mindful of Alice's constant valuation.

Aiming for a more equitable split that also considers my decreasing valuation, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This offer gives me a significant portion, considering my valuation decreases, while also being somewhat generous to Alice, hoping she'll accept to avoid further rounds and potential losses for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer and we're moving to Round 3, and considering the inflation effect which makes the money worth 36% less for me (since it's a 20% decrease each round, and this is the second decrease), I need to reassess the offer carefully.

The original amount was $1,000,000, but for me, due to the 36% decrease in value (20% in Round 1 and another 20% of the 80% remaining in Round 2, which is 16%, totaling a 36% decrease from the original), the $350,000 Alice is offering is effectively worth:

$350,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $350,000 * 0.64 = $224,000

In terms of its value to me, compared to the original Round 1 value.

However, I must consider that if I reject this offer, the value for me will decrease further. In the next round, the value would decrease by another 20%, making the potential gain even less valuable to me.

Given this, and considering that Alice's offer of $350,000 for me and $650,000 for her is relatively more favorable than my previous offer, and taking into account the diminishing value of the money for me, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further devaluation.

My decision is:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
