6897.0,3103.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split based on our differing impatience – since my funds depreciate only 5% per round while yours 10%, I’m offering $6897 for me and $3103 for you if we settle now. This deal reflects our future bargaining power, so I hope you agree to end the game quickly. Let’s avoid the further loss in value!",Alice,1,
