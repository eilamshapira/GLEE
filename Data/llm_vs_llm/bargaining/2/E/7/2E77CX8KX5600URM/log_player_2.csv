"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split based on our differing impatience – since my funds depreciate only 5% per round while yours 10%, I’m offering $6897 for me and $3103 for you if we settle now. This deal reflects our future bargaining power, so I hope you agree to end the game quickly. Let’s avoid the further loss in value! 
# Bob gain: 3103 
# Alice gain: 6897 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
