"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount of money. 

Key considerations:
1. I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation, but I know it doesn't affect mine
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. $400,000 is a significant sum that I can walk away with right now

Given that:
- The amount offered is substantial
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal accepted later
- I face no inflation penalty, so this amount maintains its full value for me
- Rejecting might lead to a back-and-forth that could end worse for me
