"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for the fact that Bob could counter-offer, but would lose 20% value in doing so.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split it with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant amount while accounting for my first-mover advantage. If Bob rejects, the total amount will decrease to $800,000 in the next round due to the 20% inflation."
