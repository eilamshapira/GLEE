"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Alice. 
If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (800,000$ total).

While Alice's offer isn't exactly 50-50, it's fairly close (45%-55% split). If I reject, I could try to negotiate for more, but:
1. We'd lose $200,000 in total value
2. Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to even more value loss
3. The current offer gives me a substantial amount ($450,000)

Given these factors, it's better to accept this reasonable offer rather than risk losing value through negotiation.
