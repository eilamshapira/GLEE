"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair and strategic offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest we split the million with me taking $600,000 and you receiving $400,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face 20% inflation each round, so I need to secure a bit more now to offset potential future losses if we continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 535000 
# Bob gain: 465000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While my share is lower than my initial proposal, accepting now is reasonable since inflation affects me more significantly (20% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round). If I reject and we continue to future rounds, the decreasing value of the money for me would likely make any potential gains not worth the wait."
