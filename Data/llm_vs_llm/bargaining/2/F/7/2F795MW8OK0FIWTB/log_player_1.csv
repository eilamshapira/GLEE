Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation hitting harder, I need to adjust my offer. 5750 for me and 4250 for you seems reasonable given the circumstances. Let's end this soon before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to his advantage, pushing for a larger share each round. While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal.  The inflation is also impacting Bob, even if we don't know by how much."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really taking a toll, Alice. I propose 6000 for me and 4000 for you. We're running out of time and the money's value is dropping fast. Let's agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer is worse than his previous one!  It seems Bob is feeling the pressure of the decreasing rounds more than the inflation. I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can get him to be more reasonable."
