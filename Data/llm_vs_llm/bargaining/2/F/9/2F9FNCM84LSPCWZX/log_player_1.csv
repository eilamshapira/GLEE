"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, here's my offer: I propose we split it 60/40. I believe this division is reasonable given the circumstances. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since I rejected your offer, I'm proposing a split that's still generous to you, but accounts for the inflation. Consider this my final offer, or we'll continue to lose value. 
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
