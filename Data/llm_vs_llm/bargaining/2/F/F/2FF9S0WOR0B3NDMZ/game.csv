0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any delays that further devalue my share by 5% per round, I'm proposing a quick settlement: you receive the entire $10000 now. I realize that if you wait until the next round—as the proposer—you can guarantee yourself the full amount anyway. To save us both the drawn‐out bargaining process, I suggest we close the deal immediately. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
