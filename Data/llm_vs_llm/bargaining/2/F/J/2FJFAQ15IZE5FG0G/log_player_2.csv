"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
2. This is only 10% of the total amount
3. While this is still a significant sum, it's a very uneven split
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by waiting

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and make a more balanced proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

This is a more balanced split where I get 40% and Alice gets 60%. It's much fairer than the previous 90-10 split while still being generous enough to Alice that she might accept it."
