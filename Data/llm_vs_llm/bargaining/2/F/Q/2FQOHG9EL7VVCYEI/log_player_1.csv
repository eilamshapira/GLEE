"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer as Alice in this negotiation game.

Given the inflation rates (5% for me and 20% for Bob per round), I should consider that the longer the negotiation lasts, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, especially for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a substantial portion of the total. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects and we go to another round, the total value decreases significantly for him due to his 20% inflation rate. I believe this balanced approach gives both of us a good outcome without risking further devaluation through extended negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable division where I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. 

Since I'm facing only 5% inflation per round compared to Bob's 20%, accepting now is advantageous. If we continued to another round, Bob would face significant devaluation of his share, and there's no guarantee that our continued negotiation would yield a better outcome for me that would offset my own inflation loss."
