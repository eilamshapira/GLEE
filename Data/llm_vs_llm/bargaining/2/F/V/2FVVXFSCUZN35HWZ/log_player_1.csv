"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The original amount I would get is $520,000, but due to 5% inflation, its value is 0.95 * $520,000 = $494,000.

Since this is still a significant amount and considering the decreasing value of money over time, I'll accept Bob's offer.
