"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob. Given that inflation affects my gains by 5% each round, I should propose a fair division that Bob would accept in this first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split where we each get half of the money. This is fair and should be acceptable to Bob, especially considering that delaying would cause my potential gains to decrease due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. If I were to reject and propose in the next round, I'd face another 5% inflation penalty, making any money I receive worth even less. This offer gives me close to half the pot, and avoiding further inflation makes it a reasonable deal to accept now."
