Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let’s avoid further losses. Considering that waiting reduces your share’s real value by 10% each round (and mine by 5%), if you wait until round 3 you’d get roughly what 310000 now is worth less. I’m offering 690000 for me and 310000 for you – a fair division given the time discount. Accept now to secure your value, rather than risk further depreciation! 
# Alice gain: 310000 
# Bob gain: 690000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
