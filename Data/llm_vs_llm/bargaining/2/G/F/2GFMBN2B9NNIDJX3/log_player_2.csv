Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 690000, ""alice_gain"": 310000, ""message"": ""Alice, let’s avoid further losses. Considering that waiting reduces your share’s real value by 10% each round (and mine by 5%), if you wait until round 3 you’d get roughly what 310,000 now is worth less. I’m offering 690,000 for me and 310,000 for you – a fair division given the time discount. Accept now to secure your value, rather than risk further depreciation!""}"
