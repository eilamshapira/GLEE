"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is generally considered equitable. However, since I know there's 5% inflation per round for me, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my share would need to be higher than 50 to maintain the same value.

If I reject, I could propose a slightly higher share to compensate for inflation. However, there's also a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation.

Given that:
1. The current offer is fair
2. Rejecting would immediately cost me value due to inflation
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a higher counter-offer
4. We risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds
