"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This is a fair offer considering we both need to be reasonable to reach an agreement, and the money is worth less to me with each round due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly more balanced split of $55 for me and $45 for you. Since the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation (already 27% less than the initial value for me), we should find a compromise soon. This offer gives you more than my previous one and is fair considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50/50 split. This is the fairest division possible, giving us each half. With inflation affecting me more each round (now about 41% less value for me), we need to reach an agreement soon. A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution and should be acceptable to both of us."
