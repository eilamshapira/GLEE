"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer, hoping to secure a good portion upfront. This considers the potential for inflation affecting Bob more significantly in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4500, while he gets $5500. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain is effectively $5500 * 0.8 = $4400 in Round 1 equivalent.

Here's my reasoning: While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount and worth considering. I need to balance the potential gains in future rounds against the risk of losing everything if we go all the way to round 12. Also, I don't know what Bob's strategy is. Maybe he will continue to lowball me in future rounds.

Given the information, I will accept the offer.
