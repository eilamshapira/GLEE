Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, further rounds will only erode the total value — you lose 20% per round while I lose 10%. To avoid more loss for both of us, I propose we settle now with $4500 for me and $5500 for you. I believe this split reflects our different discount rates and is a fair compromise. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer considering inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6380, ""alice_gain"": 3620, ""message"": ""Alice, as we progress, the impact of inflation grows sharper—my funds lose just 10% per round while yours lose 20%. In view of our differing time‐preferences, I’m proposing a division that maximizes our overall effective worth now. With $6380 allocated to me and $3620 to you, your discounted share today is equivalent to what you could expect by waiting, but without further erosion. I believe this proposal reflects the bargaining advantage I have in this round and offers you the best opportunity to preserve your value. Let’s settle now before the pot shrinks further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 6 the cost of delay is becoming even steeper for you (your future dollars are worth only 32.8% of their original value) compared to mine (59.0%). If we wait any longer, you'll be losing more value relative to your full potential, even though you’d get to propose next. To help you avoid further erosion—and since you’d be risking ending up with even less effective payoff—I’m proposing a split of $4000 for me and $6000 for you. In nominal terms it might look similar to earlier offers, but keep in mind that under current discounting this gives you roughly $1966 in effective value (6000×0.32768) versus mine about $2362 (4000×0.59049). Given that if you reject and move to round 7 your overall “pie” will shrink even further (with a maximum effective size of only about $2621 for you), I believe this offer is in your best interest. Let’s settle now and avoid the additional losses from inflation.""}"
