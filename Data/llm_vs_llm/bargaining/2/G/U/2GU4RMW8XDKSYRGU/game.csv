6148.0,3852.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. I offer $6148 for me and $3852 for you. Given that each round devalues the money (10% per round for me, 20% per round for you), delaying only hurts our future shares. This proposal factors in our future opportunities if we delay the agreement and is fair in light of our respective discounting. I hope you agree to secure as much value as possible now.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose an even split of $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair and equal share, considering we both face diminishing returns in future rounds. Let's conclude the game quickly and efficiently so neither of us loses any value!",Bob,2,
