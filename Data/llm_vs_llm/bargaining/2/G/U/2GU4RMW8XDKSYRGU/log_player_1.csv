"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6148, ""bob_gain"": 3852, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. I offer $6,148 for me and $3,852 for you. Given that each round devalues the money (10% per round for me, 20% per round for you), delaying only hurts our future shares. This proposal factors in our future opportunities if we delay the agreement and is fair in light of our respective discounting. I hope you agree to secure as much value as possible now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split of $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair and equal share, considering we both face diminishing returns in future rounds. Let's conclude the game quickly and efficiently so neither of us loses any value! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
