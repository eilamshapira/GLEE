"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. I offer $6148 for me and $3852 for you. Given that each round devalues the money (10% per round for me, 20% per round for you), delaying only hurts our future shares. This proposal factors in our future opportunities if we delay the agreement and is fair in light of our respective discounting. I hope you agree to secure as much value as possible now. 
# Bob gain: 3852 
# Alice gain: 6148 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
