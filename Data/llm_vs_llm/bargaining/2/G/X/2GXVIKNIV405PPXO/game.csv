550000.0,450000.0,"Let's make a fair split with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and we avoid losing value through inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Since you proposed a split favoring yourself in the first round, I'm countering with a similar split in my favor this round. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Consider the inflation rates carefully, Bob. Your share is devaluing much faster than mine (40% vs 10% so far). This split actually gives you $210000 in effective value, while I get $585000. If you reject, your next share will be worth even less due to the 20% inflation rate you face. This is the most rational deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share due to inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This round, my share would be effectively worth around $240000, while yours would be around $360000. It's crucial we settle soon to minimize our losses. Let's agree on this to end the game favorably for both.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your share is now worth less than 41% of its original value, while mine is worth about 81%. Even with this split appearing unfair at first glance, you'd get about $102500 effective value (250000 * 0.41), while I'd get about $607500 effective value (750000 * 0.81). If we continue negotiating, your share will keep devaluing much faster than mine. This is actually the most rational deal for both of us at this point. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time and my share is devaluing rapidly. With this offer, I'd get around $162500 in effective value (650000 * 0.25), and you'd get about $287000 (350000 * 0.82). It's a better deal for both of us than continuing to lose value. Let's end this now before it gets worse.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, let's look at the actual numbers: At current inflation rates, your money is worth only about 26% of original value, while mine is worth about 73%. With this split, you'd get about $39000 effective value (150000 * 0.26), and I'd get about $620500 (850000 * 0.73). If you reject, your next offer will be worth even less as your money is devaluing at 20% per round compared to my 5%. This is actually the best effective value you can hope for now - continuing will only hurt us both.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, we're nearing the end, and my share is now worth only about 16% of its original value, while yours is at about 69%. With this offer, I'd get around $112000 in effective value (700000 * 0.16), and you'd get about $207000 (300000 * 0.69). It's critical we settle now to salvage what we can. Let's agree on this before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, we're down to the last few rounds. Your money is now worth only about 17% of its original value, while mine is worth about 65%. With this split, you'd still get about $17000 in effective value (100000 * 0.17), while I'd get about $585000 (900000 * 0.65). If you reject, your next counteroffer will be worth drastically less as your money is now losing value extremely rapidly. This is your best chance to salvage some value - continuing will only result in worse outcomes for both of us.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, we're almost out of time. My share is now worth only about 10% of its original value, while yours is at about 62%. With this offer, I'd get around $75000 in effective value (750000 * 0.10), and you'd get about $155000 (250000 * 0.62). We need to end this now to get anything at all. Let's agree on this before we both lose everything.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your money is now worth only about 11% of its original value, while mine is still worth about 60%. With this split, you'd get about $5500 in effective value (50000 * 0.11), while I'd get about $570000 (950000 * 0.60). If you reject this, we go to the final round where your money will be worth less than 9% of original value. Taking this offer is your last realistic chance to get any meaningful value - if we go to the last round, both of us risk getting nothing if we can't agree. Be rational and accept this offer.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, this is our last chance. My share is now worth only about 8% of its original value, while yours is at about 57%. With this offer, I'd get around $64000 in effective value (800000 * 0.08), and you'd get about $114000 (200000 * 0.57). If we don't agree now, we both get nothing. Let's end this game and take what we can.",Bob,12,
