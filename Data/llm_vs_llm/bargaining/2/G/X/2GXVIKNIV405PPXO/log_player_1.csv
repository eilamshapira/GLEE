"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and we avoid losing value through inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you proposed a split favoring yourself in the first round, I'm countering with a similar split in my favor this round. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But my money will be worth another 5% less
   - And Bob's money will be worth another 20% less
   - This gives me more negotiating power

Since Bob's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I have an advantage in waiting. I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Bob's position is weaker.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 40% less and mine is worth 10% less, I can make a stronger case for a more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation rates carefully, Bob. Your share is devaluing much faster than mine (40% vs 10% so far). This split actually gives you $210,000 in effective value, while I get $585,000. If you reject, your next share will be worth even less due to the 20% inflation rate you face. This is the most rational deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share due to inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This round, my share would be effectively worth around $240000, while yours would be around $360000. It's crucial we settle soon to minimize our losses. Let's agree on this to end the game favorably for both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept:
   - I get $400,000 at 85.74% value = $342,960 effective value
   - Bob gets $600,000 at 51.2% value = $307,200 effective value

2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth ~19% less than original
   - Bob's money will be worth ~59% less than original
   - My negotiating position continues to strengthen as Bob's money devalues much faster

Since Bob's money is devaluing more rapidly than mine, and the effective values are still not greatly in my favor, I can likely get a better deal by waiting.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your share is now worth less than 41% of its original value, while mine is worth about 81%. Even with this split appearing unfair at first glance, you'd get about $102,500 effective value (250000 * 0.41), while I'd get about $607,500 effective value (750000 * 0.81). If we continue negotiating, your share will keep devaluing much faster than mine. This is actually the most rational deal for both of us at this point. Let's end this now.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and my share is devaluing rapidly. With this offer, I'd get around $162500 in effective value (650000 * 0.25), and you'd get about $287000 (350000 * 0.82). It's a better deal for both of us than continuing to lose value. Let's end this now before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept:

   - Bob gets $650,000 at 32.77% value = $213,005 effective value

2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth ~27% less than original
   - Bob's money will be worth ~74% less than original
   - The gap in devaluation continues to widen in my favor

Bob's calculation in his message is slightly off, and more importantly, my negotiating position continues to strengthen as his money devalues much faster than mine. With 6 rounds still remaining and Bob's money losing value so quickly, I can likely get a much better deal by waiting.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

With this offer, I'd get around $112000 in effective value (700000 * 0.16), and you'd get about $207000 (300000 * 0.69). It's critical we settle now to salvage what we can.

2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth ~35% less than original
   - Bob's money will be worth ~83% less than original
   - With 4 rounds remaining, my position is extremely strong

Bob's offer would actually give me less effective value than his previous offers, while my negotiating position continues to strengthen dramatically (his money is now worth only about 21% of original value). With his share devaluing so rapidly, I can get a much better deal by waiting.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

   - Only 2 rounds remain
   - Next round my money will be worth ~42% less than original
   - Bob's money will be worth ~89% less than original
   - I can make one more very strong offer next round

Bob's offer would give me less effective value than his previous offers, and with his money now worth only about 13% of original value, I maintain an extremely strong negotiating position. With two rounds remaining and such extreme devaluation on Bob's side, I can still push for a much better deal.

2. If I reject:
   - Game ends
   - We both get nothing
   - No more rounds to negotiate

While Bob's offer gives me less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds, this is now strictly a choice between getting $113,760 in effective value or getting nothing. Since this is the final round and the rules state we both get nothing if we don't agree, I must accept this offer despite it not being ideal.
