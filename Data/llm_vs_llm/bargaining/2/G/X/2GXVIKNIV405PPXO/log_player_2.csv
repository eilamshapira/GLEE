Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider the inflation rates carefully, Bob. Your share is devaluing much faster than mine (40% vs 10% so far). This split actually gives you $210000 in effective value, while I get $585000. If you reject, your next share will be worth even less due to the 20% inflation rate you face. This is the most rational deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share due to inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This round, my share would be effectively worth around $240,000, while yours would be around $360,000. It's crucial we settle soon to minimize our losses. Let's agree on this to end the game favorably for both.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your share is now worth less than 41% of its original value, while mine is worth about 81%. Even with this split appearing unfair at first glance, you'd get about $102500 effective value (250000 * 0.41), while I'd get about $607500 effective value (750000 * 0.81). If we continue negotiating, your share will keep devaluing much faster than mine. This is actually the most rational deal for both of us at this point. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's look at the actual numbers: At current inflation rates, your money is worth only about 26% of original value, while mine is worth about 73%. With this split, you'd get about $39000 effective value (150000 * 0.26), and I'd get about $620500 (850000 * 0.73). If you reject, your next offer will be worth even less as your money is devaluing at 20% per round compared to my 5%. This is actually the best effective value you can hope for now - continuing will only hurt us both.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the last few rounds. Your money is now worth only about 17% of its original value, while mine is worth about 65%. With this split, you'd still get about $17000 in effective value (100000 * 0.17), while I'd get about $585000 (900000 * 0.65). If you reject, your next counteroffer will be worth drastically less as your money is now losing value extremely rapidly. This is your best chance to salvage some value - continuing will only result in worse outcomes for both of us.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your money is now worth only about 11% of its original value, while mine is still worth about 60%. With this split, you'd get about $5500 in effective value (50000 * 0.11), while I'd get about $570000 (950000 * 0.60). If you reject this, we go to the final round where your money will be worth less than 9% of original value. Taking this offer is your last realistic chance to get any meaningful value - if we go to the last round, both of us risk getting nothing if we can't agree. Be rational and accept this offer.
