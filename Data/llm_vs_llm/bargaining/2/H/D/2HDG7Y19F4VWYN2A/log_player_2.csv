"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split at first glance
2. However, Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate
3. If I reject, I can make a proposal next round where:
   - For Alice, her portion would be worth 10% less
   - For me, my portion maintains full value
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal
5. Since we have many rounds left (11 more), I can afford to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I can justify asking for a bit more than 50-50, as waiting is more costly for her than for me. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as we still have many rounds left.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

""I propose a 60-40 split, considering that waiting reduces the value of your share by 10% each round."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her initial offer from 50-50 to 55-45 in my favor
2. The money is already worth 19% less to Alice, while maintaining full value for me
3. If I reject:
   - Next round, Alice's money will be worth 27.1% less
   - I could propose an even better split
4. However:
   - Alice is showing willingness to negotiate
   - The offer is reasonably good
   - There's risk in prolonging negotiations
   - Each round makes the total pot less valuable to Alice, potentially making her less rational

Given these factors, and that this is a decent improvement from the initial offer, I'll accept.
