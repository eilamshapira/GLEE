55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 which is a fair amount considering we both deserve a good portion. If you reject, remember that with inflation, the total value decreases by 10% next round, meaning we'd only be dividing $90 of actual value. Let's be practical and avoid losing money to inflation.",Alice,1,
