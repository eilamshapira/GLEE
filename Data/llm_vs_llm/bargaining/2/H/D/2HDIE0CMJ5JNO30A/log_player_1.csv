"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers both my interests and Bob's, taking into account the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 which is a fair amount considering we both deserve a good portion. If you reject, remember that with inflation, the total value decreases by 10% next round, meaning we'd only be dividing $90 of actual value. Let's be practical and avoid losing money to inflation.""}"
