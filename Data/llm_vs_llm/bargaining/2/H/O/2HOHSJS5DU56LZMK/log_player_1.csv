"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer, but is still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that avoids the risk of inflation affecting both of our potential gains in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $40 with 10% inflation, so effectively $36
- If I reject, we go to next round where:
  - I can make a new offer
  - But my gains will be worth 20% less than original value
  - And I'm not certain about Bob's next move

A guaranteed $36 now is better than risking further devaluation, even though it's less than my initial proposal. If I reject, my bargaining power in the next round will be even weaker due to increasing inflation.
