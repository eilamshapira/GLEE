"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your spirit in starting this game. However, note that with each round, your share loses significant value while mine remains intact. To avoid further devaluation of your payout, I'm offering a division where I take $70 and you get $30. I believe locking in this deal now is better for you than risking further inflation losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This still gives you a significant portion and compensates for the decreasing value for me. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that if you wait until round 5 as proposer, your dollars will be further devalued to only about 41% of their original worth when converted (in effective terms, roughly 40.96 if you got nearly all of the $100). To keep things efficient and make sure you don’t lose more value, I'm offering you $80 now—which, under the current round's inflation, is worth 80 × 0.512 = 40.96 in original value. I believe this deal leaves you exactly as well off as waiting would, so why not settle today? 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20
