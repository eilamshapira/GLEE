"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I'm proposing 60 for me and 40 for you. Let's secure some value now before inflation hits us too hard. This offer considers the decreasing value of money for me in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your spirit in starting this game. However, note that with each round, your share loses significant value while mine remains intact. To avoid further devaluation of your payout, I'm offering a division where I take $70 and you get $30. I believe locking in this deal now is better for you than risking further inflation losses. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the devaluation of my share, but 70/30 is too skewed. My money is now worth 60% of what it was at the start. I'm offering 65 for me and 35 for you. This still gives you a significant portion and compensates for the decreasing value for me. Let's find a balance that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 20, ""alice_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that if you wait until round 5 as proposer, your dollars will be further devalued to only about 41% of their original worth when converted (in effective terms, roughly 40.96 if you got nearly all of the $100). To keep things efficient and make sure you don’t lose more value, I'm offering you $80 now—which, under the current round's inflation, is worth 80 × 0.512 = 40.96 in original value. I believe this deal leaves you exactly as well off as waiting would, so why not settle today?""}"
