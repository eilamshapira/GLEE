"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for inflation risk. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be practical. I'm feeling the inflation pinch more. I'll accept a slight loss if we settle this round.  This offer ensures a decent share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I'll get $475,000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $380,000 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 20% less
- Bob's current offer is relatively fair considering the circumstances
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations due to the asymmetric inflation impact
