"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
- So in next round, the maximum I could get would be worth $90
- $40 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation
