"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * My $4,000 now would be worth more than any amount next round (10% less)
   * Alice's money will only depreciate by 5% next round
4. This is not a great offer, but waiting could make things worse for me

While 40% isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes accepting now better than waiting for a potentially better deal that would be worth less.
