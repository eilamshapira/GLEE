"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for her, or to reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round. If I reject, inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% for me.

If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round. So even if I propose a better split for myself, I need to factor in this 20% reduction in value.

Given that Alice opened with a 40/60 split rather than a 50/50 one, and considering the significant inflation penalty I face, I'll accept this offer.
