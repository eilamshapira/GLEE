60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more money to inflation as the game goes on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, let's consider the inflation rates. For you, waiting another round means the money loses 20% value, while for me it's only 5%. This means you have a stronger incentive to agree now. My 60/40 split is fair considering this dynamic - you still get $40 now which is worth more than potentially more money in future rounds after heavy inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but your offer wasn't in our mutual best interest. This is my final offer - it keeps a reasonable split while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my potential gains.",Alice,3,
