Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's consider the inflation rates. For you, waiting another round means the money loses 20% value, while for me it's only 5%. This means you have a stronger incentive to agree now. My 60/40 split is fair considering this dynamic - you still get $40 now which is worth more than potentially more money in future rounds after heavy inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
