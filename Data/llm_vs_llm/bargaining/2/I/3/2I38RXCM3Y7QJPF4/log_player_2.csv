"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more money to inflation as the game goes on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor, claiming that she'll lose more to inflation. However, the rules state that with each round, money is worth 5% less for me but 20% less for Alice. This means inflation actually hurts Alice more than me, giving me an advantage in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice will face a 20% inflation penalty if she further delays, while I only face a 5% penalty.

Given this dynamic, I believe I can get a better offer by continuing.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's consider the inflation rates. For you, waiting another round means the money loses 20% value, while for me it's only 5%. This means you have a stronger incentive to agree now. My 60/40 split is fair considering this dynamic - you still get $40 now which is worth more than potentially more money in future rounds after heavy inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but your offer wasn't in our mutual best interest. This is my final offer - it keeps a reasonable split while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer, considering both the current split and future inflation impacts.

Alice is now offering me $45 (with my 9.75% inflation penalty so far) versus her $55 (with her 36% inflation penalty so far). If I reject, we go to round 4 where I'd make an offer, but I'd then be facing a 14.75% total inflation penalty, and she'd face a 56% total inflation penalty.

Given the significant inflation penalty Alice is already facing, and the fact that she's improved her offer to me by 5% from the initial proposal, this seems reasonable. The inflation dynamics strongly incentivize reaching an agreement soon, especially for Alice.
