"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (just 10%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. However, for Alice, it will only be worth 5% less
4. While this offer is quite low, I still have 11 rounds left to negotiate
5. With the steep 20% depreciation for me, I need to be careful about rejecting too many offers

Despite this being a low offer, I'll reject it because it's the first round and I believe I can get a better deal, even accounting for the depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Since money depreciates faster for me (20%) than for Alice (5%), I need to be reasonable
2. However, I also need to make sure I get a fair share
3. A 60/40 split in Alice's favor might be reasonable, as it's much better than her initial 90/10 offer
4. This would give her more than half while still being fair to me

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I propose a $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice, as this represents a fair division while acknowledging that Alice has a stronger negotiating position due to the different depreciation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 80000 
# Alice gain: 920000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has decreased her offer from $100,000 to $80,000
2. The money is now worth 36% less to me, meaning her $80,000 offer is actually worth about $51,200 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 48.8% less for me (another 20% drop)
4. Alice's depreciation is much slower at only 9.75% so far
5. She clearly has a stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric depreciation
6. With 9 rounds remaining, waiting too long could be very costly for me

However, this offer is still too low. Even with the depreciation factor, I believe I can get a better deal by making another counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically:

1. Money is now worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Alice
2. My previous offer of 400k/600k was rejected
3. I need to be more accommodating given:
   - The severe depreciation rate for me (20% per round)
   - Alice's demonstrated patience
   - The fact that Alice has a much lower depreciation rate

I'll propose a more favorable split for Alice while still ensuring I get a meaningful amount:

{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000}

I propose $300,000 for me and $700,000 for Alice. This is a 30/70 split which is significantly more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, while still being much better for me than Alice's last offer of just $80,000. Given the depreciation rates, it would be in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 70000 
# Alice gain: 930000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:

1. Current offer of $70,000 with 59.04% depreciation means it's worth about $28,700 in round 1 terms
2. We're now 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds remaining
3. If I reject, next round the money will be worth 67.23% less for me
4. Alice's depreciation is still relatively low at 18.55%
5. Alice has consistently offered low amounts and rejected more balanced proposals
6. The trend is clearly getting worse for me due to the asymmetric depreciation

Given the severe depreciation rate for me and Alice's demonstrated willingness to wait, I need to seriously consider accepting this offer. While it's a low amount, waiting longer could result in getting even less value due to the 20% per round depreciation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because the rapid depreciation rate makes waiting for a better deal too risky. The time pressure is much more severe for me than for Alice, and she seems to understand this advantage."
