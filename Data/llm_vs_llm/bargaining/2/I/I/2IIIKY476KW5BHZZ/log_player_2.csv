"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

With the inflation rates (10% for me and 5% for Alice per round), if I reject now, the total value decreases. But rejecting would allow me to make the next proposal.

If I were to propose a more favorable split in round 2, the $100 would already be worth less - only $90 to me and $95 to Alice. This gives me some leverage to make a counter-offer, but inflation will continue eroding value.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and increasing inflation penalties, I'll make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation rates and the limited number of rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts, and it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly before inflation further reduces the value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $45 for me and $55 for her.

The inflation is significantly affecting the value of the money with each round:
- For me, my $45 is worth 19% less than in round 1, so effectively about $36.45
- For Alice, her $55 is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so effectively about $49.64

If I reject and we proceed to round 4, inflation will reduce the value even further. With the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for me vs 5% for Alice per round), Alice has a slight advantage in a prolonged negotiation.

Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split, which shows willingness to compromise. Considering the inflation losses and remaining rounds, this is a reasonable improvement.
