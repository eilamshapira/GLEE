"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. Bob should consider accepting this offer since waiting for the next round would mean the total amount will be worth 5% less ($95 total)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's a fair 50-50 split, and waiting another round would mean losing another 5% to inflation. Taking $50 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds.
