"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the situation, and we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's not drag this out and risk inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair now. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. Due to inflation, if I reject, my next offer would be worth 20% less to me
2. Current offer gives me $450,000, which after 20% inflation is effectively $360,000 for me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I ask for $600,000, it would be worth only $384,000 to me due to 40% cumulative inflation
4. The difference isn't worth the risk of further negotiations, and Bob might reject again
5. Better to secure a good amount now than risk further value loss"
