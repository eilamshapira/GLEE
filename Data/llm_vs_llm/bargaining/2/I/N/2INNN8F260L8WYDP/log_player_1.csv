"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This gives us both $500000. While I'm affected by inflation in future rounds, an even split acknowledges we both deserve equal shares of the money. This is a straightforward and fair solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
