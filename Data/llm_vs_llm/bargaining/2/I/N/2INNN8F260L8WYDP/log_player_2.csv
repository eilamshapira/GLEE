"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take $600000 for myself and give you $400000. This seems fair considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000.

If I reject and move to the next round, my money will be worth 10% less due to inflation. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the maximum value I could receive would be $900,000 (if Alice accepts), but that would only be worth $900,000 × 0.9 = $810,000 to me due to inflation.

While Alice's current offer gives me less than half, considering the inflation penalty I face in future rounds, this isn't necessarily a terrible offer. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering the inflation factor while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This gives us both $500,000. While I'm affected by inflation in future rounds, an even split acknowledges we both deserve equal shares of the money. This is a straightforward and fair solution that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. I propose to take $550000 for myself and give you $450000. This way, we both make a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this new offer.

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. With the current 19% inflation penalty, this $450,000 would be worth $450,000 × 0.81 = $364,500 to me in real value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face a 27.1% inflation penalty (compounding 10% each round). Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, the inflation would significantly reduce its value to me.

Since Alice improved her offer and the inflation penalty is increasing with each round, accepting now is the rational choice rather than continuing negotiations with diminishing returns.
