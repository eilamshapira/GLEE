"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% to avoid delays and inflation losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is 450,000$ for me and 550,000$ for her
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * 450,000$ now > (any amount Ã— 0.9) later
3. The offer is reasonable, and inflation will hurt my position if I reject
4. 45% is a significant portion, and avoiding inflation is valuable
