"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you rejected my offer, I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is essentially giving him less value due to the 20% decrease, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, Bob's money is now worth 20% less in the second round, and it will be 40% less in total if we reach the third round (20% in the first reduction and another 20% in the second reduction, but it's cumulative, so 20% of the remaining 80% is 16%, for a total reduction of 36%). However, for simplicity, we'll consider the direct impact of two rounds of reduction as stated, which is a simplification for this game context.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree sooner rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm increasing my offer slightly since you rejected the last one. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's money is worth significantly less to him now (48.8% less), and my money retains its value, I think I can negotiate a better deal. His offer seems to favor him too much, considering the devaluation of his share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's share is now worth 48.8% less to him, and mine remains the same, I'll make an offer that reflects this imbalance but still tries to be reasonable to end the game sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""The longer we wait, the less you'll get in real value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Inflation is eating away at my share. Take it or leave it, but I will not budge further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's share is now worth 67.23% less to him, which is a significant devaluation, and my share retains its full value, I think his offer is still not in my favor. Given that he's stated it's his final offer and considering the substantial decrease in value for his share, I believe I can get a better deal by waiting. However, I also need to consider that if we go too many more rounds, the potential for both of us to get nothing increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's share is now worth 67.23% less to him, I'll make an offer that strongly favors me, considering the significant devaluation of his share. However, I still want to leave him with an incentive to accept, rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 8500, 
""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""This is a very generous offer considering the state of your devalued share. Accepting now is in your best interest.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to push this as far as possible but I would be happy if you accepted my offer, as you will gain more in the long run. So here's my offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's share is now worth 79.03% less to him, his offer seems almost absurdly in his favor, given the drastic devaluation of his potential earnings. Since my share retains its full value, I see no reason to accept such a low offer, especially when Bob's share is worth so little to him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's share is now worth 79.03% less to him, I'll make an offer that reflects the extreme imbalance in our situations. Since his share is nearly worthless to him at this point, I'll offer him a token amount to accept the deal, as it's highly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 9500, 
""bob_gain"": 500, 
""message"": ""This is essentially your last chance to get anything. The inflation has made your share almost worthless. Take this offer or risk getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it. My final, absolutely final offer. I'm offering you a good chunk of money, much more than you'd get if the game ends. Take it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's share is now worth 86.58% less to him, his offer is still not favorable to me, given that my share retains its full value. However, we are getting close to the end of the game, and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree is becoming more significant. Given that this is his ""final, absolutely final offer,"" I might consider it, but the amount he's offering me is still quite low compared to what I could potentially get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's share is now worth 86.58% less to him and we are very close to the end of the game, I'll make an offer that is extremely favorable to me but still gives him something, considering the desperate situation he's in due to the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 9800, 
""bob_gain"": 200, 
""message"": ""This is my final offer. If you don't accept, we both risk getting nothing. Don't throw away the little value you have left.""}"

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Game over, you won't get me! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and if we don't agree, both of us will get nothing. Considering Bob's share is now worth 91.41% less to him, his offer is still not in my favor, but the alternative is getting nothing. Given the circumstances, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking everything.
