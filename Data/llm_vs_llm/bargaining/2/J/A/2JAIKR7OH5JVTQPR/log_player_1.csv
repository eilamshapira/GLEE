"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 45/55 split? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $550,000, but due to 20% inflation, its value to me is:
$550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000

Considering this, I think I can do better. 

My response is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% * 2 = 40% less than in Round 1 (compounding the inflation).

However, I'll make an offer based on the original $1,000,000 amount.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't let it slip away!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $650,000 and giving Bob $350,000, with a message suggesting this is a reasonable split before things get worse due to inflation. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle on an even split of 50/50. It's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1. This means that the $500,000 offered by Bob is actually worth:
$500,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $500,000 * 0.512 = $256,000

This is a significant reduction in value due to inflation.

However, since Bob's offer is an even split, and considering the reduced value of the money I gain, I think accepting this offer might be the best option at this point.

My response is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
