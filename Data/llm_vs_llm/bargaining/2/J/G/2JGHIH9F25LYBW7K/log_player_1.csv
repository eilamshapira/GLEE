"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering that each round makes the money worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we move to the next round, we both lose value due to inflation, so this is in our mutual interest to agree now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering you had the first offer. Let's end this before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
