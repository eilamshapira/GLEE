"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, Alice. However, an equal 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. This gives you $5000 now, which is better than waiting and losing value. We both benefit from concluding this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
