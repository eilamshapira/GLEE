"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation I'll face later. A slight advantage for me now ensures we both get good value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she keeps $6,000. She's arguing that she deserves more because inflation will affect her more severely in future rounds (20% per round for her, while I face 0% inflation).

While I understand her reasoning about inflation, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges Alice's inflation concerns while ensuring a fair distribution for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, Alice. However, an equal 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. This gives you $5,000 now, which is better than waiting and losing value. We both benefit from concluding this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting me hard. 55/45 is a compromise. It acknowledges inflation while still being a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is now offering me $4,500 (up from her previous offer of $4,000), while she takes $5,500. She's experiencing 36% inflation already, so her $5,500 is effectively worth less to her than it would have been in round 1.

This is a more reasonable split than her first offer. While I could reject and try to negotiate for slightly more, I risk further rounds where Alice's inflation penalty gets worse, potentially making her less willing to compromise. Given that I face no inflation, getting $4,500 now is guaranteed value for me.
