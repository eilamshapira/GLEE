51.28,48.72,"Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation penalties for me (and hopefully keep things fair for both), I propose a nearly equal split: I get $51.28 and you get $48.72. This division reflects an early settlement that benefits us both. Let me know if you accept!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it right down the middle.  Fair is fair, and it's getting risky to keep going.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for the proposal. Although the money I’d receive is discounted by 5% in Round 2 (making my effective gain $47.50 in Round 1–dollars), rejecting this offer would push me into later rounds where (based on what I can expect going forward) my eventual share would be even lower. I’m happy to settle on your fair split now by accepting your offer!",Alice,2,accept
