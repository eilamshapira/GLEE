"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.28, ""bob_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation penalties for me (and hopefully keep things fair for both), I propose a nearly equal split: I get $51.28 and you get $48.72. This division reflects an early settlement that benefits us both. Let me know if you accept!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it right down the middle.  Fair is fair, and it's getting risky to keep going. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the proposal. Although the money I’d receive is discounted by 5% in Round 2 (making my effective gain $47.50 in Round 1–dollars), rejecting this offer would push me into later rounds where (based on what I can expect going forward) my eventual share would be even lower. I’m happy to settle on your fair split now by accepting your offer!""}"
