"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation penalties for me (and hopefully keep things fair for both), I propose a nearly equal split: I get $51.28 and you get $48.72. This division reflects an early settlement that benefits us both. Let me know if you accept! 
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
