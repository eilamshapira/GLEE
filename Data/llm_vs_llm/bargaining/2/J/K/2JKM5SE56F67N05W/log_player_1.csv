"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a division of $10,000, keeping in mind the declining value of the money for both of us. Given that this is the first round and I am Alice, I will make a generous offer to Bob to encourage him to accept it and avoid further rounds where the value diminishes, especially for him.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3221 
# Bob gain: 6779 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significantly lower offer than I proposed. Given the inflation rate for Bob and the number of rounds remaining, rejecting this offer and making my own counter-offer in the next round seems like the best strategy.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Remember: money is worth 0% less for me than in round 1, and Bob's money is worth 10% less. I'll aim for a deal that's better for me than Bob's last offer, while still being acceptable to him given the increasing inflation affecting his share.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6300,
""bob_gain"": 3700
}
