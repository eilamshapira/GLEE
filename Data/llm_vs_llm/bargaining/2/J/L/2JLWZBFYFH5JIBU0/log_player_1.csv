"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a proposal to divide $100 with Bob. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, I should try to make a fair first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of the money. This is fair and has the best chance of being accepted immediately, which is important since delays will reduce the value for me due to the 20% inflation penalty per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. He's proposing I get $40 and he gets $60.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 3, where I can make a new proposal. However, due to inflation, any money I receive in round 3 will be worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% less in round 2, and another 20% less in round 3).

If I accept Bob's current offer of $40, with the 20% inflation penalty in this round, it's effectively worth $32 to me (in round 1 value terms).

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, even if I propose getting all $100 and Bob accepts, that $100 would only be worth $60 to me due to the 40% cumulative inflation (100 × 0.6 = 60).

Since $32 now is less than a potential $60 later (even in the best case scenario), it makes sense to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a new offer that considers the inflation effect on my earnings. Since we're now in round 3, any money I receive will be worth 40% less to me than in round 1, while Bob's money maintains its value.

Given the inflation penalty, I should propose getting a larger share to compensate for my loss in value. However, I also need to make an offer that Bob might reasonably accept to avoid going to round 4 with even more inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. With the 40% inflation penalty in this round, the $70 would effectively be worth $42 to me in round 1 terms (70 × 0.6 = 42), which is slightly better than the $40 Bob offered me in the previous round. This offer gives Bob less than before, but it's still a reasonable amount, and hopefully he'll recognize that continuing to the next round would likely result in an even worse outcome for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's new offer carefully.

Bob is now offering me $30 while taking $70 for himself. Due to the inflation in round 4, money is worth 48.8% less to me than in round 1, meaning this $30 is effectively worth only $15.36 to me (30 × 0.512 = 15.36).

If I reject this offer and make a new proposal in round 5, the inflation would increase to approximately 59% (another 20% reduction from current value). Even if I proposed taking all $100 and Bob accepted, that $100 would only be worth about $41 to me in round 1 terms (100 × 0.41 = 41).

While $15.36 is considerably less than a potential $41, the risk is that Bob could reject my round 5 offer too, leading to even worse outcomes in later rounds. Also, Bob has consistently rejected fair or even favorable offers to me, suggesting he's playing aggressively.

Given Bob's pattern of rejections and the accelerating inflation penalty, I should accept this offer to cut my losses.
