"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. 

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, where I (Bob) would get $50 and she would get $50. While this is a fair split in absolute terms, I should consider our different inflation rates.

For me, money doesn't lose value between rounds (0% inflation). For Alice, her money loses 20% value each round. This means if we go to the next round, the $100 will still be worth $100 to me, but only $80 to Alice.

This gives me negotiating leverage. If I reject now, I can propose a split in the next round that gives me more than $50 while still being acceptable to Alice (since her alternative would be worth even less to her).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given our different inflation rates, I'll make an offer that reflects the strategic advantage I have while still being reasonable for Alice to accept.

Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, the $100 is now worth only $80 to her in this round. If she rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3, where the money will be worth even less to her (only $64).

I'll propose a split that gives me more than the initial 50-50 offer, but still gives Alice enough that she should rationally accept rather than continue to a round where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice has rejected my previous offer of 60-40 and is now proposing a 30-70 split in her favor. 

Let me consider our positions:
- For me (Bob), money doesn't lose value between rounds (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money has already lost 36% of its value since round 1
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where I would make the next offer
- In round 4, Alice would face even more inflation (around 49% less value than round 1)

While Alice's offer gives me less than the initial 50-50 split, I need to consider that if I reject, we'll move to another round where Alice's position weakens further. This gives me significant leverage for the next round.

Given that I can make a better offer for myself in the next round that Alice would be more pressured to accept due to her increasing inflation, and that $30 is significantly less than what I could reasonably expect:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 4, Alice is facing even higher inflation - the money is worth about 49% less to her than in round 1. This gives me significant leverage, but I should still make an offer that Alice would rationally accept rather than continue to more rounds with even worse inflation for her.

If Alice rejects my offer now, we'll go to round 5, where the money will be worth approximately 59% less to her than in round 1. That's a significant further loss.

Given this situation, I'll make an offer that's better for me than the initial 50-50 split, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept it rather than face another round of inflation.
