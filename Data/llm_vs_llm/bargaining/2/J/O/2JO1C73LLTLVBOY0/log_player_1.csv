"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because of the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we can agree now, we'll both walk away with a good amount. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Given the inflation concerns, I believe a fair split would be 40 for me and 60 for you. Let's settle this quickly before the value decreases further! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
