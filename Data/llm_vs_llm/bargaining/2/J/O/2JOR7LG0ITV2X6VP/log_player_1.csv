I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to see if he's willing to take it. I'm hoping he'll be tempted by the quick win and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, but still keeping most of the money for myself.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept before the inflation gets too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the previous ones, and considering the inflation rate, accepting it is the best strategy."
