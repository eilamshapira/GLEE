Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, how about an even split that respects both of our positions? I propose $400k for me, and $600k for you. It’s a fair offer considering the situation. Let’s finish this efficiently! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
