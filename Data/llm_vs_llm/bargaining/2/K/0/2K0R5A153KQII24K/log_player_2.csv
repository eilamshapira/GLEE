"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. 
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $250,000 I would gain is worth approximately $810,000 in the first round's value (1 - 0.1 - 0.1 = 0.81, then 250000 / 0.81 ≈ 308641, but since the value is decreasing, 250000 * (1/0.81) ≈ 308641, so the real value is 250000, and the equivalent value in round 1 is 250000 / 0.81 ≈ 308641). 

However, since Alice's offer is not very favorable to me, and the inflation effect on her is higher, I will reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect on me, which is 10% less in each round, the total value I would get is reduced by approximately 28.9% (1 - 0.1 - 0.1 - 0.1 = 0.729, or 1 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729) from the original value.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the reduced value for me and the higher inflation effect on Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $350,000 I would gain is worth approximately $530,159 in the first round's value (1 / 0.6561 ≈ 1.523, then 350000 * 1.523 ≈ 530159, but since the value is decreasing, the real value is 350000, and the equivalent value in round 1 is 350000 / 0.6561 ≈ 533333, so the real value is approximately 530159, or more precisely 533333).

Given that Alice's offer is still not very favorable to me, but considering the significant inflation effect on both of us, I will accept this offer to avoid further devaluation.
