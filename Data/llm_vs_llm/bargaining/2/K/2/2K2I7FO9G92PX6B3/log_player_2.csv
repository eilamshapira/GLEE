"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a 60/40 split. It's a fair offer that lets us both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""How about a 52.5/47.5 split?  It's a slight advantage for me, but still a good deal considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I came down from 60% and you're still trying to increase your share. This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is correct about the time pressure, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. A 45/55 split heavily favors her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit substantially before inflation eats away at the value.""}"
