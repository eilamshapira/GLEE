"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more balanced offer in the next round. Given that Alice's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), there's room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a more balanced split that still gives me a slight advantage, but is much fairer than Alice's initial offer. This leaves both of us with a substantial amount, and considering the time pressure and inflation rates, it's a reasonable proposition."
