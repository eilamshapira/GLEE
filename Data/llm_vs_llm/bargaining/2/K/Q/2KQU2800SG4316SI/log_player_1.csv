"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob rejects. Since this is round 1, the full value is still available.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and gives both of us a good outcome. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount, and we avoid the risk of inflation reducing the value in subsequent rounds."
