"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 10% inflation coming up, getting only 10% of the total amount is too low, as there's still room for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

Let me explain my proposal: I suggest a more balanced split where I get $4,500 and Alice gets $5,500. This is a fair offer considering that:
1. Alice gets the majority of the money
2. It's much more equitable than the previous 90-10 split
3. If Alice rejects, we'll both lose value due to my 10% inflation penalty"
