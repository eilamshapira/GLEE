"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that further delay will cost us both through inflation, I propose a fair division where I receive $5263 and you get $4737. This offer reflects the value of acting now rather than waiting for round 3. Please accept so we can both secure as much value as possible. 
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
