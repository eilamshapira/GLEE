5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand you want more than 50%, but I'm the one facing significant inflation penalties. My money is now worth only 64% of the original value due to inflation, while yours isn't affected. This offer of 58/42 compensates for some of that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll face even greater losses due to inflation, which isn't fair to me.",Alice,3,
