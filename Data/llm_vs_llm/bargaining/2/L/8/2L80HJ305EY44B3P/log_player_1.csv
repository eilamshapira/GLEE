"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer considering the inflation effect I'm facing. If I propose too little for myself, I risk losing value if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares, and we can both walk away satisfied without risking value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but I'm feeling a bit more ambitious today.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor? We can avoid any potential inflation losses by settling this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to consider the inflation effect more carefully. After 2 rounds, my money is worth 80% Ã— 80% = 64% of the original value, so I should adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want more than 50%, but I'm the one facing significant inflation penalties. My money is now worth only 64% of the original value due to inflation, while yours isn't affected. This offer of 58/42 compensates for some of that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll face even greater losses due to inflation, which isn't fair to me.""}"
