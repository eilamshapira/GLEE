Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares, and we can both walk away satisfied without risking value loss from inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more than 50%, but I'm the one facing significant inflation penalties. My money is now worth only 64% of the original value due to inflation, while yours isn't affected. This offer of 58/42 compensates for some of that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll face even greater losses due to inflation, which isn't fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
