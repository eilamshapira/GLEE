"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's crucial to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Previous Offer:** Bob rejecting my initial offer and countering with a 50/50 split suggests he might be aiming for a larger share. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a compromise. It's slightly more favorable to me than Bob's 50/50 proposal but still offers him a significant sum. This might be enough to secure an agreement before inflation further erodes my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is significantly decreasing for me, and Bob is unlikely to offer more. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
