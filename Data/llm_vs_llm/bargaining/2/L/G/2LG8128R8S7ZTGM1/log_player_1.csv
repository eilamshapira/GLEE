"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's value of the money decreases by 20% each round, and it's now the 3rd round (2 rounds have passed), the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value to Bob. 

To maximize my gain, I'll try to give Bob an amount that is equivalent to what he would have gotten if he accepted my previous offer, considering the devaluation.

My previous offer was 4000 for Bob. Now, that amount is worth 0.64 * 4000 = 2560 to Bob. To make it equivalent, I'll offer him 2560 / 0.64 = 4000.

However, since the money is worth the same to me, I'll try to give him a bit less to maximize my gain.
