"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split $10000 equally. How does that sound to you, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting an equal split where we both get $5,000. However, I need to consider the 5% inflation that affects me with each round. If I reject and wait until the next round, my potential money will be worth 5% less.

If I accept now, I get $5,000 at full value. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, and we eventually agree, the money will be worth less to me. 

Given that this is a fair offer at full value and waiting would only decrease the value for me, I'll accept.
