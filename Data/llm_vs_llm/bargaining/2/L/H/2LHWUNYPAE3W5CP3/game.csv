,,,Bob,1,reject
3104.0,6896.0,"Alice, I understand fairness is important—but waiting will cost us both. Remember that every round reduces our take-home, especially yours by 20%. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3104 in nominal terms (which is worth 0.8× that today) versus a riskier future. I’m offering you a fair share given the discounting; please accept my proposal so we both avoid further loss.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I understand the value of time, Bob, but I'm not giving up on a fair share.  We both lose with each round, so let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to reduce my share further to 4000, but I need you to be reasonable.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but your offer gives me an effective 4860 dollars after discount—less than what I anticipated securing on my upcoming proposal. Let's continue negotiating so we can both maximize our actual take-home amounts.",Bob,3,reject
6100.0,3900.0,"Alice, as we move into round 4, both our shares are worth less – yours even more so. Waiting further means you'll be facing a 48.8% reduction (0.512 multiplier) on your nominal amount. To avoid additional losses, I'm offering you 6100 nominal dollars (about $3117 in effective value) while I take 3900 (roughly $2843 effectively). I believe this strikes a fair balance given our discount rates. Let's finalize this deal now and avoid further erosion of our gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Bob, I'm starting to feel like you're taking advantage of the situation.  My share is shrinking faster than yours, so I need to be realistic. I'm reducing my ask to 3500, but I'm still sticking to a fair compromise.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I understand you're trying to adjust to the inflation, but this offer still leaves me with an effective share of about $4265 while yours drops to only around $1434. We both know that we need to maximize our actual values in these rounds. I believe we can structure a proposal that balances our effective take-home amounts more fairly. Let's keep negotiating.",Bob,5,reject
4400.0,5600.0,"Alice, as we reach round 6 the cost of delay is steep – every round further erodes our take‐home pay. In this round my money is worth about 59% of its face value while yours is worth only 33% if we continue. With my offer, you’d secure a nominal 4400, which at today's discount (×0.32768) gives you roughly 1443 in effective value – slightly above what you might expect if you counter in the next round. I believe this offer balances our interests given the harsher depreciation ahead. Let’s agree now to avoid unnecessary losses for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the end.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I still need to see some compromise from your side. I'm lowering my offer to 2500, hoping we can avoid getting nothing at all.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, as we approach the end, further delays would only squeeze our values even more. With your proposal, I secure a 7500 share, which—after accounting for the 46.86% depreciation—gives me roughly $3985 in today’s terms. Given your share will be worth only about 26.21% of its nominal value, it’s clear that maximizing our actual benefits requires settling now. I accept your proposal in the interest of both of us.",Bob,7,accept
