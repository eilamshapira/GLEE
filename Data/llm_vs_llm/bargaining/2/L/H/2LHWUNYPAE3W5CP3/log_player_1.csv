Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand fairness is important—but waiting will cost us both. Remember that every round reduces our take-home, especially yours by 20%. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3104 in nominal terms (which is worth 0.8× that today) versus a riskier future. I’m offering you a fair share given the discounting; please accept my proposal so we both avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 3104 
# Bob gain: 6896

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 4, both our shares are worth less – yours even more so. Waiting further means you'll be facing a 48.8% reduction (0.512 multiplier) on your nominal amount. To avoid additional losses, I'm offering you 6100 nominal dollars (about $3117 in effective value) while I take 3900 (roughly $2843 effectively). I believe this strikes a fair balance given our discount rates. Let's finalize this deal now and avoid further erosion of our gains.

# Bob gain: 3900

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we reach round 6 the cost of delay is steep – every round further erodes our take‐home pay. In this round my money is worth about 59% of its face value while yours is worth only 33% if we continue. With my offer, you’d secure a nominal 4400, which at today's discount (×0.32768) gives you roughly 1443 in effective value – slightly above what you might expect if you counter in the next round. I believe this offer balances our interests given the harsher depreciation ahead. Let’s agree now to avoid unnecessary losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600
