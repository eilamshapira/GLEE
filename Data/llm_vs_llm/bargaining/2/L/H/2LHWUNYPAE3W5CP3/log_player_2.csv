Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6896, ""alice_gain"": 3104, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand fairness is important—but waiting will cost us both. Remember that every round reduces our take-home, especially yours by 20%. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3,104 in nominal terms (which is worth 0.8× that today) versus a riskier future. I’m offering you a fair share given the discounting; please accept my proposal so we both avoid further loss.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value of time, Bob, but I'm not giving up on a fair share.  We both lose with each round, so let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to reduce my share further to 4000, but I need you to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but your offer gives me an effective 4,860 dollars after discount—less than what I anticipated securing on my upcoming proposal. Let's continue negotiating so we can both maximize our actual take-home amounts.""}"

Round 4

Waiting further means you'll be facing a 48.8% reduction (0.512 multiplier) on your nominal amount. To avoid additional losses, I'm offering you 6100 nominal dollars (about $3117 in effective value) while I take 3900 (roughly $2843 effectively). I believe this strikes a fair balance given our discount rates. Let's finalize this deal now and avoid further erosion of our gains.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like you're taking advantage of the situation.  My share is shrinking faster than yours, so I need to be realistic. I'm reducing my ask to 3500, but I'm still sticking to a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to adjust to the inflation, but this offer still leaves me with an effective share of about $4,265 while yours drops to only around $1,434. We both know that we need to maximize our actual values in these rounds. I believe we can structure a proposal that balances our effective take-home amounts more fairly. Let's keep negotiating.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Alice, as we reach round 6 the cost of delay is steep – every round further erodes our take‐home pay. In this round my money is worth about 59% of its face value while yours is worth only 33% if we continue. With my offer, you’d secure a nominal 4400, which at today's discount (×0.32768) gives you roughly 1443 in effective value – slightly above what you might expect if you counter in the next round. I believe this offer balances our interests given the harsher depreciation ahead. Let’s agree now to avoid unnecessary losses for both of us.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the end.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I still need to see some compromise from your side. I'm lowering my offer to 2500, hoping we can avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 7500 
# Alice gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, as we approach the end, further delays would only squeeze our values even more. With your proposal, I secure a 7500 share, which—after accounting for the 46.86% depreciation—gives me roughly $3,985 in today’s terms. Given your share will be worth only about 26.21% of its nominal value, it’s clear that maximizing our actual benefits requires settling now. I accept your proposal in the interest of both of us.""}"
