"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation is a concern, so let's settle this quickly for both our benefits. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $4000 I would receive is worth approximately $3800 (5% less than the original value).

Given this, I don't think Bob's offer is favorable to me. I'd like to try and negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money is now worth less. For me, it's 5% less in each round, so in Round 3, the money is worth approximately 90.25% of its original value (0.95 * 0.95). For Bob, it's 20% less in the first round and then presumably the same rate continues, so in Round 3, the money is worth approximately 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8).

With this in mind, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This split considers the inflation impact on both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. This is a slight adjustment to your previous offer, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both sides. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $4500 I would receive is worth approximately $3857 (14.26% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, especially since the inflation rate for Bob's gain is significantly higher. I'd like to try and negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effects, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is affected more by inflation, I'll try to take advantage of this.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Given the significant inflation impact on your side, I'm willing to make a slightly more favorable offer to you than my previous one, but still reflecting the economic reality.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we're both feeling the pressure of these negotiations. Let's go back to the beginning. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to resolve this before inflation eats away at any potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $5000 I would receive is worth approximately $3880 (22.62% less than the original value).

Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split now seems more reasonable. Additionally, Bob's gain is affected even more drastically by inflation, which might make him more eager to accept a deal.
