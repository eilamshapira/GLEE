0.0,10000.0,"Bob, because every delay costs me dearly (a 10% drop per round) while your money remains intact, I must offer you the entire $10000 now. If you reject my offer, you'll simply get to propose in round 2 and still claim all $10000. To avoid a needless delay (and further hurting my position), I ask that you accept this proposal immediately.",Alice,1,
