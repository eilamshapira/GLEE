"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, because every delay costs me dearly (a 10% drop per round) while your money remains intact, I must offer you the entire $10000 now. If you reject my offer, you'll simply get to propose in round 2 and still claim all $10000. To avoid a needless delay (and further hurting my position), I ask that you accept this proposal immediately. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
