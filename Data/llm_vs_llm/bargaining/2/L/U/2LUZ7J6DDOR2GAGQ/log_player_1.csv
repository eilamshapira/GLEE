"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this division is actually fairer than it seems. If we go to the next round, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me, making equal splits increasingly unfavorable for me. This offer gives us both a good outcome without delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a 50-50 split is fair. Since the value of the money decreases for you with each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer. Let's both walk away with an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
