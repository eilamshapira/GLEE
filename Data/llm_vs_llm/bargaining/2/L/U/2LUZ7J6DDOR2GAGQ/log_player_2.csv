"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this division is actually fairer than it seems. If we go to the next round, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me, making equal splits increasingly unfavorable for me. This offer gives us both a good outcome without delays. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a 50-50 split is fair. Since the value of the money decreases for you with each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer. Let's both walk away with an equal share.""}"
