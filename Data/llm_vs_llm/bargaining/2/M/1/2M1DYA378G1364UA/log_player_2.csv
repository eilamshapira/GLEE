"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $4000 (40%) while keeping $6000 (60%) for herself
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- However, there will be a 5% inflation penalty
- The total amount will become $9500 if I reject
- My potential share would need to be significantly better to make up for the loss

While the split isn't perfectly equal, $4000 is still a substantial amount. Rejecting would mean we'd lose $500 in total value, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal after negotiations.
