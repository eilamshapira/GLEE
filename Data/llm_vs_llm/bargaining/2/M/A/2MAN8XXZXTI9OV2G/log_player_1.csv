"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. It's still a good deal for you, and it's better to agree now before the value decreases further for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is: While I'd prefer the 60-40 split I proposed, Bob makes a valid point about inflation. If I reject this offer, in the next round any money I receive will be worth 20% less to me. Bob's offer of 4500 now is worth more than getting 5000 or even 6000 in future rounds due to the compounding inflation penalty. It's better to accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds."
