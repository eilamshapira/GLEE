"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation or ending up with nothing if we don't agree in time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this. My $5000 is now worth only $4000 due to the 20% inflation, while Bob's $5000 maintains its full value. While a 50-50 split might seem fair on the surface, with inflation I'm actually getting less value than Bob.

However, if I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation for me (my share would be worth another 20% less), and there's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer. The risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing if we don't agree within the rounds is also significant.
