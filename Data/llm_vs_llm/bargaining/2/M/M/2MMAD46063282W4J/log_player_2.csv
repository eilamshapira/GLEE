"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be reduced by 10% due to inflation (at least for me). So $100 becomes $90.

With the current offer, I get $40. If I reject and propose something like 60/40 in my favor next round, I'd get $54 (60% of $90), but Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more value decay.

The current offer of $40 is reasonable enough given the inflation risk, and Alice is more likely to reject a significantly lower offer for herself.
