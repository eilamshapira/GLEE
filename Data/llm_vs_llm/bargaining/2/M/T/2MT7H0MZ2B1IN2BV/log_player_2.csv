"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 in the next round would only be worth $38 to me

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more money in the next round to make rejection worthwhile. Since $40 is a reasonable portion and inflation works against me, I should accept this offer.
