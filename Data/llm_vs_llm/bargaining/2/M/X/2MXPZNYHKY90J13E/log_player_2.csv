"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair 50/50 split, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the maximum I could get would be worth 9,000 to me. 

Given that 5,000 now is better than a maximum possibility of 9,000 in the next round (which Alice might not accept anyway), I should accept this offer.
