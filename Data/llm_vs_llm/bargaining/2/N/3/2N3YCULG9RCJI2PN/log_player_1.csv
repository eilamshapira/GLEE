Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to avoid further delays. To secure our positions against potential losses from future inflation—especially considering the uncertainty you face—I propose a 60/40 split in my favor: I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I believe this offer is fair under the circumstances and benefits us both by closing the deal now. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice that with each additional round the inflation penalty you face remains at 36%, while my share is not affected. If you reject this offer and wait for round 5, you'll gain the proposer role, but I can then leverage your discount to claim nearly the entire million. To avoid further rounds and locking in an even worse outcome for you, I’m offering a final settlement: I receive $990000 and you $10000 (which is worth roughly $6400 in round-1 terms). I believe this is the most rational division under our current conditions. I urge you to accept. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting this round you’d become the proposer in round 7—but your gains would then be hit by an even harsher inflation discount (roughly 26% of round‑1 value) compared to the current 40.96% value. In numbers: if you wait, even grabbing nearly the whole nominal pie leaves you with an effective value of about $262000. By accepting my offer now, you lock in $645000 nominal—which is worth approximately $645000 × 0.4096 ≈ $264000 in today’s terms. That slight edge, combined with the certainty of avoiding further rounds (and further losses), makes this deal your best option. I’m sure you’ll agree it’s rational to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 645000 
# Bob gain: 355000
