"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a significant amount. 

Since I'm aware that inflation doesn't affect my portion (0% for me), I don't have a strong pressure to accept immediately due to declining value. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could give me leverage in the next round if her value decreases.

Given that I can make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, and there's no direct cost to me for waiting, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor since I have the power to make the offer now. I'll aim for a 60-40 split in my favor, which is essentially reversing Alice's previous offer.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's still a substantial amount for Alice
2. It's more equitable than an extreme split
3. If Alice rejects, she'll have to consider any inflation effects on her side when making her next offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me 4500$ (up from 4000$ in round 1)
2. Alice's 5500$ is actually worth only 3520$ to her due to 36% inflation (5500 * 0.64)
3. My 4500$ maintains its full value since inflation doesn't affect me
4. Alice seems to be showing willingness to negotiate by improving my offer

Given that:
- Alice's portion is actually worth less to her now
- She's offering me a better deal than round 1
- If I reject, another round of inflation will further decrease her value
- But she might become more aggressive in her demands if I push too hard

I think this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept.
