"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 40/60 split in her favor, citing fairness and the desire to finish quickly.

Since this is the first round, if I reject, I can make my own counter-offer next round. However, due to the 20% inflation rule for me, the $100 would only be worth $80 to me in the next round. This means my maximum possible gain would be $80 if I somehow got all the money in round 2.

If I accept now, I get $40, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'd need to get more than $50 of the inflated value to exceed what I can get now (since $40 > $50 Ã— 0.8).

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I should accept.
