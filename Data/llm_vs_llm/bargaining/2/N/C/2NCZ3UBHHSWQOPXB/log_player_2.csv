"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair, I don't have information about how inflation affects Alice. There's a chance I could secure a better deal in a later round if Alice is more negatively impacted by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming slightly higher than the initial 50/50 split to see if Alice is sensitive to the declining value of the money. If she accepts, I gain a slight advantage. If she rejects, I can adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has mirrored my previous offer, and with inflation already at 9.75%, the potential gains from holding out further are dwindling. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even after the impact of inflation."
