Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  This is a fair split, given the inflation.  Accept, and we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth actually 45 * 0.81 = 36.45 (since it's 19% less than the original value). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the value of the money for me has decreased by 19% in round 2 and another 10% in round 3, so the total decrease is 19% + 10% = 29% (1 - 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.271), but since the value was already decreased by 19% in round 3, I will calculate the new value as 0.9 * 0.81 = 0.729 of the original value.
