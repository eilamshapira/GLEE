"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I hope you find this reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, Alice's money is devaluating much faster than mine. It's in my best interest to stall and let her desperation grow, leading to potentially better offers in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make this move along.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Alice's offer, I signal that I'm willing to wait for a better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice knows her potential gains are shrinking rapidly. This offer, while still tilted in my favor, might seem appealing enough to accept given the time pressure.
* **Message:** The message aims to sound somewhat appealing (""generous"") but also conveys impatience (""let's make this move along""). This reinforces the time pressure on Alice."
