Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer of $40 is actually worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 to me.

I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob in each round. 

In round 1, the value was $100.
In round 2, the value for me was $100 * 0.8 = $80, and for Bob was $100 * 0.9 = $90.
In round 3, the value for me is $80 * 0.8 = $64, and for Bob is $90 * 0.9 = $81.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
