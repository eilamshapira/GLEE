"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer, I'll have a chance to make my own proposal next round, but the total value will be 5% less for me. So the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round.

Alice is offering me $40 now, which is less than half but still a substantial amount. If I reject and wait, I risk further depreciation and potentially getting a worse deal if we can't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds.

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the guaranteed $40 on the table now, I'll accept this offer.
