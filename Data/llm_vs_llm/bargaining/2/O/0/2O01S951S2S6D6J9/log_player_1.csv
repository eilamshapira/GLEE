"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good share while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $40, it's actually worth $32 to me (40 * 0.8).
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less.

This offer is quite low for me, and even though inflation will hurt my future gains, I think I can still get a better deal by negotiating. Bob might be testing how low I'll go.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, the money I receive will be worth 40% less than its nominal value due to inflation (20% less than round 1, and another 20% less). I need to account for this by asking for a higher nominal amount to compensate for the inflation loss.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my ask to $65 because with 40% inflation, this will actually be worth $39 to me (65 * 0.6). This still leaves Bob with $35, and I'm hoping this more aggressive offer will help us reach a faster agreement before inflation erodes too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer of $35 now, with 48.8% inflation, it would be worth approximately $17.92 to me (35 * 0.512).

If I reject and continue to the next round:
- Inflation will increase by another 20%
- Any future gains will be worth even less
- We're already in round 4 out of 12, so we still have room to negotiate
- But the value is deteriorating quickly

This offer is quite low, and even with inflation, I think I can still do better by negotiating one more round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, we're in round 5, and the inflation means any money I receive is worth 59% less than in round 1 (0.8^4 = 0.41, so 41% of original value). I need to balance between getting a good deal and reaching an agreement before inflation erodes too much value.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split. With 59% inflation, the $60 would actually be worth about $24.60 to me (60 * 0.41). This is a more moderate offer than my last one, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a reasonable return. I hope Bob sees this as a fair move toward finding middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer of $30 now:
- With 67.23% inflation, it would be worth approximately $9.83 to me (30 * 0.3277)
- This is a very low amount

If I reject:
- We'll move to round 7
- Inflation will increase by another 20%
- Any future gains will be worth about 73.8% less than round 1
- We're halfway through the 12 rounds
- Both of us risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

While $9.83 in real value is low, the rapidly increasing inflation and risk of getting nothing make this a difficult decision. However, I think Bob's offer is too low even accounting for these factors.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 7, and inflation means any money I receive is worth 73.8% less than in round 1 (0.8^6 = 0.262). Time is becoming critical, and the risk of both getting nothing is increasing. I need to make a more compromising offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split. With 73.8% inflation, the $50 would actually be worth about $13.10 to me (50 * 0.262). This is a completely fair split that demonstrates I'm willing to meet in the middle. Given we're more than halfway through our rounds and the severe inflation impact, I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise to end our negotiation."
