"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly higher split in my favor since Bob has no inflation penalty and I need to account for potential future devaluation if he rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split considering I face inflation risk if we continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now, due to 10% inflation my $50 is actually worth $45 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, I'll face 20% inflation, making any money worth even less
- Bob's position is stronger since he faces no inflation

Given that the money will be worth even less to me next round, and this is a reasonable split even with the 10% inflation...
