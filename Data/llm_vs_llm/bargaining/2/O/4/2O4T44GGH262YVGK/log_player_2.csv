"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round:
* If we go to round 2, $60 would be worth $54 to her
* If we go to round 3, it would be worth $48.6 to her

I can leverage this to get a better deal in the next round. If I reject now, I can offer something that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the time pressure she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round, I can offer her slightly less than her original offer and she should rationally accept to avoid further loss in value.

If she rejects my offer, her $50 would only be worth $45 to her in the next round, so I'll offer her an amount that's better than what she'd get by waiting.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is both fair and strategically sound. Since the money is worth less to Alice in future rounds but maintains full value for me, she should accept this balanced offer rather than risk getting less value in the next round."
