"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. With each round, the money is worth 20% less to me, but not to Bob. If I make a fair offer now, we can both benefit rather than lose value through delays.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should accept it. If we delay, I'll lose 20% of the value each round, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer acknowledges that reality while still securing a reasonable portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it gives Bob a significantly larger share while I'm already facing inflation pressure. We're still early in the negotiation and I can make a counter-offer that better accounts for the inflation disadvantage I'm facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic given the inflation factor affecting me each round. Let me propose an offer that accounts for this disadvantage while still giving Bob a reasonable share.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split than my initial proposal. Since I face 20% inflation each round while Bob doesn't, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my first offer while still maintaining a fair division that acknowledges my time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. While I'm facing increasing inflation pressure, Bob's proposal is even less favorable than before. We're still in the early-middle rounds (4 of 12), so I have room to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a more pragmatic offer considering the inflation effect is becoming significant. At this point, I've lost almost 50% of my potential value due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly even split of the money. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both my position (facing significant inflation pressure) and Bob's negotiating power. With each passing round, the effective value I receive continues to decrease, so I hope Bob will recognize this balanced offer as reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with the significant inflation pressure I'm facing, Bob's offer continues to move in an increasingly unfavorable direction for me. We're at the halfway point of our negotiation period, so I'll make another counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect severely impacting me (over 67% loss in value already), I need to make a more aggressive compromise to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing this split because at this point, the time pressure is significant for me. The inflation means each round costs me substantially, while Bob faces no such pressure. This offer acknowledges Bob's stronger position while still trying to secure a reasonable portion for myself. If we continue much longer, even a smaller percentage will be worth accepting due to the compounding inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Given that we're now 8 rounds in, and the money is worth 79.03% less to me due to inflation, further delays would significantly diminish any gains I might negotiate. My $250,000 is effectively worth about $52,425 of the original value, and if we continue negotiating, even higher nominal amounts would translate to less real value for me due to the compounding 20% inflation per round."
