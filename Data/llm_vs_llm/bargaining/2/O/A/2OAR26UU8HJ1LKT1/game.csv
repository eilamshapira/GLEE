60.0,40.0,"Hey Bob, let's make this quick and fair. Since it's round 1, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. If we go another round, the value decreases for you. Let's both benefit now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. Since the value decreases for me, I'll make a fair offer. 55 for me and 45 for you. It's better for both of us to agree now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I understand your point, Bob. However, considering the inflation impact that's greater on you, I'm proposing 58 for me and 42 for you. It's a better than last round offer for you considering our context. Let's settle this!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's split it evenly. With inflation affecting me more, it's a fair deal for both. If we go further, I'll lose even more value. Let's end this with a 50-50 split.",Bob,4,
