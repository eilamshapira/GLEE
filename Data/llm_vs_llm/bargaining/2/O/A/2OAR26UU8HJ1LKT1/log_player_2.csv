"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this quick and fair. Since it's round 1, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. If we go another round, the value decreases for you. Let's both benefit now!

# Alice gain: 60

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob. However, considering the inflation impact that's greater on you, I'm proposing 58 for me and 42 for you. It's a better than last round offer for you considering our context. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's split it evenly. With inflation affecting me more, it's a fair deal for both. If we go further, I'll lose even more value. Let's end this with a 50-50 split.""}"
