"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer
   - The money maintains its value for me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Given these considerations, a guaranteed $500,000 is a reasonable outcome. There's no strong reason to reject a fair split, especially when rejection could lead to a worse outcome.
