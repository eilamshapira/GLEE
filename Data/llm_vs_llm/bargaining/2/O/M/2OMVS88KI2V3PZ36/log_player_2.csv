"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that we both face inflation risk with each round, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider Alice's offer, weighing the current split against potential future gains, while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if I reject.

Alice has offered me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the total effective value would be $900,000 from my perspective. To improve my position, I would need to secure more than 44.4% of the total in the next round.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the reasonable initial offer, accepting now seems prudent.
