Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly at 50-50. This way, we both maximize our gain and avoid diminishing returns in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In Round 1, my rejected offer would have given me $6000.
In Round 2, Bob offers me $5000, but due to 20% inflation, this is actually worth $4000 to me.
For Bob, his $5000 is worth $4500 due to 10% inflation.

I should reject this and make a counter-offer in Round 3, as this offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.
