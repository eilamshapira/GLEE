Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split. This is a fair offer considering we both lose value in future rounds. Let's avoid delays and agree now.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Due to inflation affecting me more severely (20% vs your 10%), this split is actually quite fair. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
