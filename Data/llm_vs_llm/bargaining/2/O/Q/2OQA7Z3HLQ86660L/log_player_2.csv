"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation (my share decreases by 5% each round), let's settle now. I’m proposing a near even split—520K for me and 480K for you—so that we both secure a substantial amount. I believe this is a fair deal given the risks of delay. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
