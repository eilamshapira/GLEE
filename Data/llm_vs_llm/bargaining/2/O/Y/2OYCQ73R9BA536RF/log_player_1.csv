"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to offer a fair and reasonable split in this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the $10,000 evenly between us - $5,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both equal value, and I think it's the most straightforward solution that benefits us equally."
