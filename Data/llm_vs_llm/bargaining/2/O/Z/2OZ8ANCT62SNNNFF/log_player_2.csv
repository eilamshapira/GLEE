"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start fair: an even split now avoids any further inflation complications. I propose 50$ for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make an offer
   - But the money will be worth 20% less to me
   - So $100 will effectively be worth $80 for me
   - Even if I ask for more in the next round, I might end up with less real value

Given that it's a fair first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly, I should accept.
