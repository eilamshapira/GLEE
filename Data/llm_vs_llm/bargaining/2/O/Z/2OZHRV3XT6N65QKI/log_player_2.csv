"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair 60-40 split. This way, we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I think I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a cooperative tone.
