"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is less than half. Since we're in round 1 and I have the advantage in this negotiation due to Alice's 10% inflation penalty per round, I should reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for the inflation dynamics. Since Alice faces a 10% penalty per round while I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if Alice rejects and we continue to later rounds, the total value will decrease for her due to the 10% inflation penalty she faces each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $450,000 instead of her initial $400,000 offer. However, this is still less than what I proposed in round 2.

Let me consider the inflation dynamics. Alice now faces a 19% inflation penalty compared to round 1. If we continue to round 4, her penalty will increase further. This puts me in a stronger negotiating position.

Since we still have many rounds left and my bargaining position improves with each round due to the asymmetric inflation, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has rejected my previous offer of a 60-40 split and responded with a 45-55 split, I'll adjust my proposal slightly while maintaining an advantage. The inflation penalty for Alice increases with each round, so waiting is more costly for her than for me.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000}

I propose a 58-42 split in my favor. This is still advantageous for me, but shows some movement from my previous position. If Alice rejects this, her share will be worth even less in the next round due to the 10% additional inflation she faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered an even 50-50 split, which is better than her previous offers. Let me consider the situation:

1. We're now in round 5, and Alice faces a 34.39% inflation penalty
2. If I reject, we move to round 6, and I can make another offer
3. Alice's inflation penalty will increase further in the next round
4. We still have 7 rounds remaining after this one

Given the significant inflation penalty Alice already faces and the fact that her offer has improved to a 50-50 split, this offer is getting more reasonable. However, since I still have a strong negotiating advantage due to the asymmetric inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice has moved to a 50-50 split, which shows she's becoming more concerned about the inflation penalty. Given that her inflation penalty is now significant (over 34%) and will increase further with each round, I'll maintain a strong position while showing some flexibility to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 570000, 
""alice_gain"": 430000}

I propose a 57-43 split in my favor. This is slightly more favorable to Alice than my previous offer while still recognizing my stronger negotiating position. With Alice facing increasing inflation penalties, accepting this offer would be better for her than continuing to later rounds where her share would be worth even less."
