Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable rather than risk the money losing more value."

It seems the inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains, making her more agreeable to a fairer split. It's still a good deal for me, so I'll accept."
