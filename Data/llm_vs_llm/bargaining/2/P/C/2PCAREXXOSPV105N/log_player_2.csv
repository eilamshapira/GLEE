"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Here's a fair split. Let's make this deal and avoid inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. That's a 40/60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, due to 5% inflation, the total value will decrease to $9500
5. Alice's offer isn't completely fair, and I could potentially get a better deal even with inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a fair 50-50 offer, acknowledging that we've already lost some value due to inflation:

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. We've already lost money due to inflation, let's not lose more.""
}"
