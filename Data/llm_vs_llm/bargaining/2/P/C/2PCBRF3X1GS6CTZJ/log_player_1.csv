"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 4750 is 950, so the value I'll get is 4750 - 950 = 3800.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less in each round, so it's 20% less in round 1, 36% less in round 2 (20% of 80% is 16%, so 20% + 16% = 36%), and 40.8% less in round 3 (20% of 64% is 12.8%, so 36% + 12.8% + some more, approximately 40.8%) of its original value for me. 
For simplicity, I will calculate with 40% less.
40% of my gain will be lost due to inflation.
Let's offer Bob $4500, and I'll take $5500. However, I need to account for the inflation.
If I take $5500, I'll actually get approximately 55% * 10000 * (1 - 0.4) = 3300 of value.
If I offer Bob $4500, he'll get 4500 * (1 - 0.05) = 4275, since his money is worth 5% less.
I'll try to get closer to an equal split in value.
Let me recalculate my offer.
If I take $6000, I'll get approximately 60% * 10000 * (1 - 0.408) = 3523 of value.
If I offer Bob $4000, he'll get 4000 * (1 - 0.05) = 3800, since his money is worth 5% less.
This seems more balanced.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
48.8% of 5250 is approximately 2563, so the value I'll get is 5250 - 2563 = 2687.
Considering this, I think this offer might be reasonable, given the significant inflation I'm experiencing.
