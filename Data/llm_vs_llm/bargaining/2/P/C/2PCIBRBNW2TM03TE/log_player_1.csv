"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be strategic, considering the inflation factor affecting my gains with each round.

Here's my proposal for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **First-mover advantage:** I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on.
*   **Inflation consideration:** The longer we wait, the less my share will be worth. I'm trying to avoid too many rounds.
*   **Fairness:** While I'm prioritizing my own gain (due to inflation), I'm still offering Bob a significant amount, hoping he'll see it as a reasonable deal.
*   **Unknown Bob's rationality:** I don't know how Bob will react. Starting with a decent offer reduces the chances of a rejection based on principle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has made an offer. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $6000, Bob gets $4000.
*   **My situation:** Money is worth 10% less than round 1.
*   **Bob's situation:** Money is worth 20% less than round 1 for Bob.

Let's calculate the relative value for me:

*   Receiving $6000 now is equivalent to receiving $6000 / 0.9 = $6666.67 in round 1 value.

Although $6000 seems like a good number, considering inflation it's less appealing than it seems. However, it's still a good chunk of money. I'm going to accept to avoid further value reduction in further rounds.
