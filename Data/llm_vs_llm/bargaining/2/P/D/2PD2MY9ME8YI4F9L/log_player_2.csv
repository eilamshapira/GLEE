"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is now closer to an even split, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer would give me $45 worth only $36.45 in the first round's value. Holding out for a better offer, even with the risk of further inflation, is still the better strategy at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are becoming severe. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, accepting this offer gives me $50 that's worth $32.80 in round one terms. Rejecting it risks even further inflation and potentially worse offers from Alice.  It's time to secure a reasonable, though not perfect, payout."
