"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. I need to consider whether I should accept this or make a counter-offer.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me. But for Alice, it will be worth 20% less, so only $800,000.

Since I could propose a more favorable split in the next round when Alice's position is weaker due to her higher inflation rate, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 5%), she has a stronger incentive to settle quickly.

The money is now worth 95% of its original value to me and 80% to Alice. If we go to another round, it will be worth even less to both of us, but especially to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 while I take $550,000. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we continue to the next round, the money will lose 20% more value for you versus only 5% more for me, so accepting now is in your best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has countered with an offer giving me $450,000 and herself $550,000. I need to evaluate if this makes sense to accept.

Looking at the inflation factors:
- For me, money is now worth 9.75% less than in round 1
- For Alice, money is now worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My inflation will increase by another 5% (to 14.75% total)
- Alice's inflation will increase by another 20% (to 56% total)

Since Alice has made a substantial concession from her initial offer (moving from 600k to 550k for herself), and considering the continued inflation we both face (especially Alice), this is a reasonable compromise. The offer gives me 45% of the total, which is fair given our inflation dynamics.
