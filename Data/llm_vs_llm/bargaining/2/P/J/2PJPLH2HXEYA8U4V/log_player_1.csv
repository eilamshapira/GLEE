Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of $500000. This is the most equitable division that respects both of our interests equally. We still have 10 rounds left, but there's no reason we can't reach an agreement now with a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
