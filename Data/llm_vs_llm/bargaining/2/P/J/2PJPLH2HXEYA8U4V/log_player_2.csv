"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999999 and leave you with 1.  Consider it a gift.  ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would receive $1 and she would get $999,999. This is an extremely one-sided division that greatly favors Alice.

Since we have 12 rounds total, and if no agreement is reached we both get nothing, I should reject this unfair offer and make a more balanced counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of $500,000. This is the most equitable division that respects both of our interests equally. We still have 10 rounds left, but there's no reason we can't reach an agreement now with a fair split.""}"
