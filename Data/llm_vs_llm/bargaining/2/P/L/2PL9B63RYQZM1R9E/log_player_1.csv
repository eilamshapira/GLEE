"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our interests, considering that time pressure affects me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being very attractive to Bob. If he declines, my next opportunity to make an offer will be in round 3, where the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so I want to make this first offer appealing enough to potentially close the deal early."
