"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Alice's offer. She's proposing $450,000 for me in round 1. Given the 20% inflation per round, I need to consider what my expected value is if I reject this and make a counteroffer in round 2.

If I reject, I'll be the proposer in round 2, but the money will be worth 20% less. Even if I were to get the same amount in round 2, $450,000, it would be worth only $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.

Given the risk of further rounds and the corresponding inflation, $450,000 in round 1 is a reasonable offer.
