600000.0,400000.0,"Hey Bob, let's keep this simple and fair. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. Are we good to go with this offer?",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a new split given our different inflation rates. Since the money loses 20% value for you each round but not for me, waiting is costly for you. This offer of $350000 is actually worth more to you now than $400000 would be in the next round (which would only be worth $320000 to you). This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hey Bob, let's try to reach a deal here. I'll take $400000, which accounts for the inflation impact on my side. I believe this is a fair balance considering your offer and our different circumstances.",Alice,3,
