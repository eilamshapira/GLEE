Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's keep this simple and fair. I'll take $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. Are we good to go with this offer?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a new split given our different inflation rates. Since the money loses 20% value for you each round but not for me, waiting is costly for you. This offer of $350000 is actually worth more to you now than $400000 would be in the next round (which would only be worth $320000 to you). This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
