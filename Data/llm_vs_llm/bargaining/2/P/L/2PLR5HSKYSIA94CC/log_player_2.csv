"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep this simple and fair. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. Are we good to go with this offer? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor ($600,000 for her, $400,000 for me).

Since money doesn't lose value for me between rounds (0% inflation for me), but Alice faces 20% inflation per round, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. If we go to the next round, any amount will be worth 20% less to Alice.

I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round while I don't lose any value, I have a strategic advantage. In this round, $1,000,000 is still worth $1,000,000 to me, but it's only worth $800,000 to Alice. I should offer her a split that recognizes this diminished value to her while being fair enough that she'll accept rather than moving to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a new split given our different inflation rates. Since the money loses 20% value for you each round but not for me, waiting is costly for you. This offer of $350,000 is actually worth more to you now than $400,000 would be in the next round (which would only be worth $320,000 to you). This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's try to reach a deal here. I'll take $400000, which accounts for the inflation impact on my side. I believe this is a fair balance considering your offer and our different circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $600,000 while taking $400,000 for herself.

This is actually a very good offer for me. The money doesn't lose value for me between rounds, and Alice has now proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, which is better than an even split. She's accounting for her inflation penalty by accepting less.

If I reject, we go to another round where Alice would face even more inflation (about 49% total from the original value), but there's a risk she might ask for more to compensate. This current offer gives me a clear majority of the money with no risk.
