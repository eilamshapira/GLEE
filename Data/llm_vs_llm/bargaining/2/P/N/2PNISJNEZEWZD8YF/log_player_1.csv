Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly equal split of 50/50. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money due to inflation. This way we both walk away with the maximum possible value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
