"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. Accept? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor, which gives her a significant advantage. Since this is only the first round, I can make a counter-offer if I reject. However, I should keep in mind that the value decreases by 5% each round, so waiting too long will reduce what we both receive.

I'll reject this offer and make a more equitable counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges the declining value of the money while still being reasonable for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal split of 50/50. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money due to inflation. This way we both walk away with the maximum possible value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's settle for this split to minimize further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved toward a more equal split, offering me 45% instead of the initial 40%. She makes a good point about minimizing losses from inflation, as we're already seeing a nearly 10% reduction in value after just two rounds.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 with further depreciation. While I could try to negotiate for a 50/50 split again, the continued inflation would mean we'd both end up with less in absolute terms. A 45/55 split now is better than potentially getting an even split of a smaller pie later.
