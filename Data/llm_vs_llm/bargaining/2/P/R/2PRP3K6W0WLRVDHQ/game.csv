400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation. It's still a great deal for you!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but given the discounting effects and my upcoming opportunity to propose the division, I believe I can secure a better effective outcome by moving to the next round. Let's proceed to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"Hi Bob, in light of the escalating inflation and the inherent risks of waiting further, I propose we settle now. With this offer, I secure an effective value slightly above what Iâ€™d get under your last proposal, while you still receive a substantial share. Let's end the game on a strong note for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,3,
