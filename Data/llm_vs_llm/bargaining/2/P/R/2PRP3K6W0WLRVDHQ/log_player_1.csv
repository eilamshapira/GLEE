"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation. It's still a great deal for you!

# Bob gain: 600000
