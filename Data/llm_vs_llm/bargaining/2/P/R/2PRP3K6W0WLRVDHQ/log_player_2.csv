"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $500000 for each of us. Let's secure our full value now before inflation takes its toll. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation. It's still a great deal for you!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of the escalating inflation and the inherent risks of waiting further, I propose we settle now. With this offer, I secure an effective value slightly above what Iâ€™d get under your last proposal, while you still receive a substantial share. Let's end the game on a strong note for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the inflation.  Accepting guarantees a good amount now, whereas further rejection risks even more value loss for me."
