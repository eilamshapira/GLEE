"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me, but not knowing how it affects him. Since this is the first round, I should aim for a relatively fair split to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm asking for slightly more than half. This gives me a slight advantage but isn't so greedy that Bob will automatically reject it.
*   The large sum involved means even a small percentage difference is a significant amount of money.
*   It is better to get something now than risk getting nothing if we reach round 12.

I am ready for Bob's response."
