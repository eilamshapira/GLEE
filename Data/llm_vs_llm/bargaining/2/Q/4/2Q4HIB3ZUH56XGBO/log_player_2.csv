"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $49 out of $100, which is close to an even split. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would be worth about $95 to me.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, even if I proposed taking the entire $100, it would only be worth $95 to me. And Alice might reject that anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since $49 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds, this is actually a reasonable offer.
