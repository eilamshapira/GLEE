"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Since Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

To calculate the actual values, I'll take into account the inflation. Let's say I offer $550,000 to myself and $450,000 to Bob. The actual value I'll get is $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000, and the actual value Bob will get is $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor this time, considering the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hitting us both hard, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $500,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $500,000 * 0.729 = $364,500.

On the other hand, if I reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the inflation will hit me even harder, reducing the value of my potential gain by another 10%.

Given the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split might be the most reasonable option at this point. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further devaluation of the money.
