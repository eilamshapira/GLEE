5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest an equal split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, delaying would be costly for me, so this seems like a fair solution that works for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate affecting me is 20% per round, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in the next rounds. This way, we both still get a significant amount.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, now I understand that inflation affects you more (20% vs my 5%). However, that doesn't justify you taking more money initially. If anything, it means we should both want to resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $4500, which is fair considering we're already in round 3 and both losing value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm still willing to take a bit more. However, I'm also willing to compromise and decrease my initial offer. Let's settle this before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5 and the money is losing significant value for both of us, especially you. I've adjusted my offer to give you more than my last proposal. Let's be reasonable - this offer is fair given our inflation rates, and continuing will hurt both of us financially. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with meaningful value.",Alice,5,
