"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that is fair but takes into account my inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest an equal split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, delaying would be costly for me, so this seems like a fair solution that works for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate affecting me is 20% per round, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in the next rounds. This way, we both still get a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, now I understand that inflation affects you more (20% vs my 5%). However, that doesn't justify you taking more money initially. If anything, it means we should both want to resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $4500, which is fair considering we're already in round 3 and both losing value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm still willing to take a bit more. However, I'm also willing to compromise and decrease my initial offer. Let's settle this before the money loses even more value.

# Bob gain: 5800

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5 and the money is losing significant value for both of us, especially you. I've adjusted my offer to give you more than my last proposal. Let's be reasonable - this offer is fair given our inflation rates, and continuing will hurt both of us financially. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with meaningful value.""}"
