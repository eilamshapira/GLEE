"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest an equal split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, delaying would be costly for me, so this seems like a fair solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate affecting me is 20% per round, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in the next rounds. This way, we both still get a significant amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, now I understand that inflation affects you more (20% vs my 5%). However, that doesn't justify you taking more money initially. If anything, it means we should both want to resolve this quickly. I'm offering you $4500, which is fair considering we're already in round 3 and both losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point, but considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm still willing to take a bit more. However, I'm also willing to compromise and decrease my initial offer. Let's settle this before the money loses even more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5 and the money is losing significant value for both of us, especially you. I've adjusted my offer to give you more than my last proposal. Let's be reasonable - this offer is fair given our inflation rates, and continuing will hurt both of us financially. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with meaningful value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
