"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face higher depreciation, this is a fair offer that you should accept now rather than risk further losses. I'm offering you $450000, which is better than what you'd get after another round of 20% depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% depreciation for me, I should think carefully about this offer.

Since the original amount was $1,000,000 and it's now worth 20% less to me, the current value to me is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. If I reject this offer, the value will decrease further.

Bob's offer of $450,000 is 56.25% of the current value ($800,000). While it's not a great deal, the risk of further depreciation is significant.
