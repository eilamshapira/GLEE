"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - The total value for me decreases by 5%
   - The total value for Alice decreases by 20%
   - I get to make the next offer

Given that Alice faces a much steeper depreciation (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage to get a better deal. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice will be more pressured to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces a 20% depreciation while I only face 5%, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough for her to accept given her higher depreciation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since you face higher depreciation, this is a fair offer that you should accept now rather than risk further losses. I'm offering you $450,000, which is better than what you'd get after another round of 20% depreciation.""}"
