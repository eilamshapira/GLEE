"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 40% to avoid delays that will hurt us both due to inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we're both losing value with each round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offer: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for him
2. Due to 10% inflation for me, $450,000 is now worth $405,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject and propose in next round:
   - Money will be worth even less (another 10% drop)
   - Bob will likely reject again if I offer too much in my favor
   - Further delays hurt me more than Bob (10% vs 5% inflation)

Given that:
- The current offer gives me a reasonable amount
- Further negotiation will definitely reduce my real gain
- Bob has a stronger position due to lower inflation impact
