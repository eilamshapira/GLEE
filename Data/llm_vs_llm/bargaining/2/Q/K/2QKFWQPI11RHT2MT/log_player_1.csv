"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll factor in the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me and the slower decrease for Bob. To start, I'll make a reasonable offer, giving myself a slight edge considering I'm facing steeper inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think strategically. My money is losing value faster than Bob's. Let's calculate the current worth of the amounts.

*   **My Round 1 offer:** $5500 * (1 - 0.20) = $4400 worth now if I had accepted then.
*   **Bob's Round 2 offer:** $5000 * (1 - 0.20) = $4000 worth now.

While Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, the inflation hurts me more. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get something better in the next round, hoping I can make a more convincing offer as time runs out.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. The pressure is on! My inflation is now twice what it was in round 1 (20% per round). Bob's is 5% per round, so 10% total. Let's be a bit more aggressive to compensate. I will offer Bob slightly more than what he offered me last round accounting for his decreased rate of inflation and still give myself a larger cut accounting for my increased rate of inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is getting greedy, likely sensing my desperation with the rapidly increasing inflation. Let's calculate the current worth:

*   Bob's Round 4 offer for me: $4500 * (1 - 0.488) = $2304
*   Bob's Round 4 offer for himself: $5500 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4718.70

This is a terrible offer for me considering how much the money is worth to me now. I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to be realistic. I am quickly losing value. Let's try to get *something* rather than nothing. I'll offer a deal that is slightly more favorable to Bob than to me, but hopefully good enough that he accepts it rather than risk us both getting nothing.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
