"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It's a reasonable offer, but considering the inflation rates and my advantage in them (5% vs 20%), I could potentially negotiate a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. The inflation will impact Alice more significantly than me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself, considering the inflation rates affect Alice more than me, but still keeping it fair enough that she should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest an even 50-50 split. This is fair and respects both of our contributions. Given that inflation affects you more significantly (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to accept this equitable division now rather than continuing to later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer slightly in my favor, but I still think I can get a better deal given the inflation asymmetry. Since inflation is affecting Alice much more severely (36% already vs my 9.75%), I have more leverage as rounds continue.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500 while I take $5,500. Given our inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for you per round), continuing this negotiation is significantly worse for you. We're already in round 4, where your potential gains have lost 36% of their value, while mine have only lost 9.75%. If we continue to round 6, you'll lose over 50% of value. A fair deal now is in both our interests, particularly yours."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has significantly improved her offer, giving me $5,200 which is better than my previous request. With inflation affecting her much more severely than me (59.04% vs 18.55%), she's making a reasonable concession. This is a good deal for me.
