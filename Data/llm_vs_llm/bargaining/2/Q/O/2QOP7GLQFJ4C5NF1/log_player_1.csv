"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. Given your higher inflation rate of 20%, this is a fair offer that gives you more value now than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering my higher inflation rate, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This 55-45 split is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer of $45 to me, with 5% inflation = $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 real value
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - Money will depreciate another round
   - My 5% compounds (0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025)
   - Bob's 20% compounds even more (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64)
   - This gives me negotiating power, but also reduces total value

The offer is not great, but waiting another round will reduce the total pie significantly. Since Bob's inflation is higher, he might be even less likely to accept a reasonable offer next round as he'll need even more nominal dollars to make up for his losses.
