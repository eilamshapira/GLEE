"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round, my money will only be worth 3200$ (80% of 4000$)
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, I'll still lose value due to inflation

Given these factors, while the split isn't entirely in my favor, accepting 4000$ now is better than risking further depreciation of my share.
