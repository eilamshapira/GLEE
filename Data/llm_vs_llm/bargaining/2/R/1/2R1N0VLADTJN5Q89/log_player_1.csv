"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the differential inflation rates. Since I'm starting, I'll aim for a fair split that accounts for our different time preferences.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you $4,500 which is slightly less than half, but if you reject and we go another round, both our shares become less valuable - yours even more than mine due to your higher inflation rate. This is a fair offer considering our different situations.""}
