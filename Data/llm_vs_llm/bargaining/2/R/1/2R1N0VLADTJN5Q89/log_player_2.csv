"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is slightly less than half, but if you reject and we go another round, both our shares become less valuable - yours even more than mine due to your higher inflation rate. This is a fair offer considering our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $4500, which is 45% of the total $10,000. While this is less than half, I need to account for the inflation penalties. If I reject:

- My money loses 20% value per round
- Alice's money loses 10% value per round

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, even if Alice accepts my counter-offer, both of us will get less value due to inflation. For me, that 20% loss is significant.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, her initial offer of $4500 is reasonable. The longer we negotiate, the worse my position becomes due to my higher inflation rate.
