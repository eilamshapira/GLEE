"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself.

If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round (so the total pot is effectively worth 8000$ to me), but only 5% less to Alice (so worth 9500$ to her).

While 4000$ isn't a terrible offer, given that I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round and the asymmetric inflation isn't too punishing yet, I believe I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money has depreciated once (worth 80% to me and 95% to Alice), I need to make a strategic offer that Alice would likely accept, considering she faces less depreciation pressure than I do.

Let me propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

The reasoning behind this offer:
1. For me, 5500$ is now actually worth 4400$ (80% of 5500)
2. For Alice, 4500$ is worth 4275$ (95% of 4500)
3. This is a fair improvement over her initial offer while still being reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further depreciation"
