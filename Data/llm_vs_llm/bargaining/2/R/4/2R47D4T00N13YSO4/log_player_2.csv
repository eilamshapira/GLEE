"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer from Alice.

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) receive $100,000 while she keeps $900,000 of the $1,000,000 total. This is a 10%-90% split in Alice's favor.

While I do get a substantial amount of money ($100,000), this division is quite uneven. If I reject, I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal in the next round that could potentially be more favorable to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split where we both receive equal amounts. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
