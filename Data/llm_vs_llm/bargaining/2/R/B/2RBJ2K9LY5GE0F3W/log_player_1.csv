"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that any delay will cost me 20% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough for Bob to likely accept, avoiding the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48.7 
# Bob gain: 51.3 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $48.7, but it's worth 20% less, so effectively $38.96
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 40% less due to compounding inflation
3. Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, and pursuing another round would significantly decrease my potential gains
4. Even if I made a higher offer next round, the inflation would eat away at the benefits
