"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the 5% inflation risk if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split since it's close to 50-50 but gives me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should accept, and if he declines, the total value will decrease by 5% for me in the next round, making both of us worse off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With the 5% inflation effect, if I accept this $5000 offer now, it's actually worth $4750 to me (5000 * 0.95).

If I reject and make a new offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth another 5% less to me
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer
- Even if I propose a better split for myself, the inflation will eat into those gains

Since $4750 is still a reasonable amount and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept this offer.
