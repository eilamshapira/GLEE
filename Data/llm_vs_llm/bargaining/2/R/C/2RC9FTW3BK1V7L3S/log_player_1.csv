"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a bit of backward‐induction reasoning—and keeping in mind that each round reduces your (Alice’s) “pie” by 20% and Bob’s by 10%—an equilibrium analysis suggests that in round 1 you can “squeeze” Bob’s acceptance condition. In brief, if you reject an offer in round 1 then in round 2 Bob will be the proposer. In our reasoning we work backwards from round 12 (where the proposer can claim almost everything) to round 1 and determine the “reservation value” for the responder in each round. (For example, in round 12 Bob would give Alice almost nothing since if she rejects then she gets zero; then in round 11 Alice would offer Bob just enough so that his discounted gain is equal to what he would have gotten in round 12; and so on.) Following a backward‐induction chain, it turns out that by round 1 Bob’s continuation value as proposer in round 2 is approximately 76.96 (face dollars), but because in round 2 Bob’s $100 is worth only 90% per round (i.e. multiplied by 0.9) his effective value is about 69.26. (We omit “epsilon” improvements for clarity.) 

Since Bob will accept any immediate offer that gives him at least that effective value, you (as Alice, proposing in round 1 when the full $100 counts fully for both players) can offer Bob a face amount of about 69.27 dollars and keep about 30.73 dollars for yourself. (Note that the numbers are approximate; if we were to work out the full chain precisely there might be slight adjustments—but the idea is that you keep roughly 30% of the $100 and give Bob about 70%.) 

Thus, in round 1 your JSON offer can be:

{""alice_gain"": 30.73, ""bob_gain"": 69.27} 

Good luck with the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
