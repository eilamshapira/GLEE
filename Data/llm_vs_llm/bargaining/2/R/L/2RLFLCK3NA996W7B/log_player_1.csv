"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, 55/45 seems more reasonable to me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 10% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since Bob's offer gives him a larger share, I'll accept it to avoid further devaluation.
