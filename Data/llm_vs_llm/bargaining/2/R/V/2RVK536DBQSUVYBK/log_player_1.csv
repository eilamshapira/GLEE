"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fairly generous first offer to increase the chances of acceptance, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a reasonable majority while still being fair to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, the total value will decrease by 20% next round
3. The offer appears cooperative rather than overly aggressive"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $572,500, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $458,000 to me
2. My previous offer would have given me $550,000 with no inflation
3. Bob's offering a nominally higher amount, but inflation makes it less valuable
4. If I reject, the next round will have another 20% inflation for me
5. The current offer, despite inflation, is still reasonable and further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
