With inflation affecting only me, time favors you - but that doesn't justify such an unbalanced split. This offer gives you the majority (60%) while still being fair to both of us.

With inflation now at over 22% for me, this offer acknowledges the time pressure while still being fair. Let's end this negotiation - you get a clear majority (65%) and I get a reasonable share despite the inflation disadvantage.",Bob,6,
