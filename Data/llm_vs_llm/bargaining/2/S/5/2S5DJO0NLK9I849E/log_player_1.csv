Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges we both deserve a substantial portion. Your offer was quite unbalanced. Since inflation only affects me, we should reach an agreement soon - this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both significantly.

Bob's offer:

With inflation affecting only me, time favors you - but that doesn't justify such an unbalanced split. This offer gives you the majority (60%) while still being fair to both of us. Let's resolve this now before inflation erodes more value.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the improvement in your offer, but I'm still seeking a more balanced agreement. I've reduced my request significantly from my initial proposal. With inflation now at over 22% for me, this offer acknowledges the time pressure while still being fair. Let's end this negotiation - you get a clear majority (65%) and I get a reasonable share despite the inflation disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob more than me:**  While I lose nothing each round, Bob's potential gains are steadily decreasing. This puts pressure on him to make a deal.
* **The offer is reasonable:** 65% is a strong majority, and while I'd prefer more, it's unlikely Bob will agree to anything significantly higher given the inflation working against him.  
* **Time is running out:**  We're past the halfway point, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we risk walking away with nothing. 

It's a gamble, but accepting now secures a guaranteed win, even if it isn't the ideal split I initially hoped for."
