"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer still gives you a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 80000 
# Alice gain: 920000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $80,000 while she gets $920,000, which is only 8% of the total money for me.

Given that the money loses 5% of its value for me each round, if I reject this offer:
- In round 2, I could propose a better split
- However, if we continue to disagree, the value continues to decrease for me
- By round 12, the value would be significantly reduced

While $80,000 is a substantial amount in absolute terms, it's a very small percentage of the total. I believe I can propose a more equitable distribution in the next round, so I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a much more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure and asymmetric devaluation affecting me.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges we both deserve a substantial portion. Your offer was quite unbalanced. Since inflation only affects me, we should reach an agreement soon - this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at your potential gains. Let's settle this now. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has increased her offer to me from $80,000 to $150,000, but this is still only 15% of the total amount.

Due to inflation, this $150,000 is actually worth about $135,375 to me (9.75% less). If we continue to the next round, the inflation will reach 14.3% (3 rounds of 5% compounded).

If I reject, I can make another proposal, but Alice seems to be taking a hard stance with her ""final offer"" language. I need to balance the risk of continued negotiation against the current offer.

$150,000 is still significantly lower than what would be a fair split. Even with inflation affecting me, I believe I should continue negotiating for a more equitable distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I've moved significantly from my previous position to find middle ground. With inflation affecting only me, time favors you - but that doesn't justify such an unbalanced split. This offer gives you the majority (60%) while still being fair to both of us. Let's resolve this now before inflation erodes more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a generous offer considering inflation is working against you. Don't let greed get the better of you. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now increased her offer to me to $250,000, which represents 25% of the total amount. With 18.55% inflation affecting me, this $250,000 is actually worth about $203,625 to me.

Alice is gradually improving her offers, moving from $80,000 to $150,000 and now to $250,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but still trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure.

If I reject and we move to round 6, inflation will be about 22.6% for me. Time is definitely working against me in this negotiation.

I need to weigh the risk of holding out longer against accepting this improved but still unbalanced offer. $250,000 is a substantial amount, but I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the improvement in your offer, but I'm still seeking a more balanced agreement. I've reduced my request significantly from my initial proposal. With inflation now at over 22% for me, this offer acknowledges the time pressure while still being fair. Let's end this negotiation - you get a clear majority (65%) and I get a reasonable share despite the inflation disadvantage.""}"
