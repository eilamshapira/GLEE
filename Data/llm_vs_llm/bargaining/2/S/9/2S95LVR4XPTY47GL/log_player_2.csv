Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer based on this amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $35 I would gain is actually worth $35 * 0.64 = $22.40 to me (since it's 36% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer again, the money is now worth even less to me due to inflation. The total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $51.20 (40% less than the previous round, which was already 36% less than the original).

I'll make an offer based on this amount, trying to get as much value as possible.
