"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the offer considering inflation.

In Round 1, I proposed to get $600,000.

Now, due to 20% inflation, the money is worth less. To calculate the real value of what I get, I multiply my offer by (1 - inflation rate), that is (1 - 0.20) = 0.80.
Therefore, the offer I got in round 2 is worth in the same term as round 1 is: $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000 in round 1 terms.
Now, let's compare this with the initial offer:

I initially offered $600,000
Bob is offering $450,000, which is $360,000 in round 1 terms.

Since the value offered by Bob is less than the value that I would have received in the first round, and the game continues and inflation keeps taking a toll, I should take this offer.
