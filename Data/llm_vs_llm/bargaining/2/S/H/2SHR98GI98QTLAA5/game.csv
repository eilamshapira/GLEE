5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to settle things quickly given the cost of delay on my end. Recognizing that postponing our agreement reduces my take‐home value by 20% each round, I propose dividing the $10000 so that I receive $5556 and you get $4444. I believe this offer – which awards you a slightly larger share than a 50/50 split – reflects a fair compromise in light of our respective positions. I hope you’ll agree that it’s best for both of us to finalize the deal now.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle quickly. However, considering the 10% inflation affecting my end, I must prioritize my own interests. Given that your loss per round is 20%, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which still allows you to walk away with a substantial amount while accounting for my own needs. Let's work together to find a fair solution.",Bob,2,
