"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer for the first round, taking into account the 10% inflation effect that I'll face if we move to another round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Since I face 10% inflation each round, if we delay, the money becomes worth less to me. This is a fair first offer that gives us both a substantial portion.""
