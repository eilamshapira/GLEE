"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Since I face 10% inflation each round, if we delay, the money becomes worth less to me. This is a fair first offer that gives us both a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject this offer:
- Next round I can make a counter-proposal
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me
- $45 now would become worth equivalent to $36 next round

Alice's current offer gives me $45, which is a decent share. If I reject and try to get more next round, I would need to get significantly more than $56.25 (to offset the 20% loss) for it to be worthwhile. Given that Alice would likely reject such a high demand, accepting now seems better.
