"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation rates: 20% for me and 5% for Bob per round. I'll aim for a fair but advantageous first offer.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is completely fair. Since inflation impacts me much harder (20% vs your 5%), accepting now is mutually beneficial. We both walk away with equal amounts and avoid any depreciation.""}"
