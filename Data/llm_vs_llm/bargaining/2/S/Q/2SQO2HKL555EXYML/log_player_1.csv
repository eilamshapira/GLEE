"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair division, considering the inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable split considering that any delay will cost me 20% of the value, so I need a slightly higher portion to protect against potential inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $400,000 to me
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount will be worth another 20% less
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, leading to further inflation losses
4. A 50-50 split is generally fair, but the differential inflation rate makes this less favorable for me
5. However, trying to negotiate further might lead to worse outcomes due to my higher inflation rate

Given that my inflation rate is higher than Bob's, and we have limited rounds, I should accept this offer now before my purchasing power decreases further.
