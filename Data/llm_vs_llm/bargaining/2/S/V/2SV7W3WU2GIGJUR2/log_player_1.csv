"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I should be compensated for the inflation risk I face in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 20% inflation per round, this $45 now is worth more to you than $60 in the next round would be ($48). This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, which due to 20% inflation is actually worth $36 to me
- If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 40% less to me
- For example, even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would be worth only $36 to me
- And Bob might reject again, leading to even worse outcomes

Bob is correct in his logic. Getting $45 now (worth $36 to me) is better than risking another round where I'd need a much larger amount to get the same value.
