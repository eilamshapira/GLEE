"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I should be compensated for the inflation risk I face in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and we go to the next round:
1. I can make a counter-offer
2. For Alice, any money in the next round will be worth 20% less
3. So her $60 would only be worth $48 to her in the next round

Since Alice faces significant inflation pressure, I have negotiating leverage. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, I should propose a split that's better for me while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round where her money would be worth even less.

If she rejects my offer, her $45 would only be worth $36 to her in the next round, so this should be compelling.
