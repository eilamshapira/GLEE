Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. I'm offering an equal division of $500000 each. As you mentioned, inflation affects my value by 10% each round, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
