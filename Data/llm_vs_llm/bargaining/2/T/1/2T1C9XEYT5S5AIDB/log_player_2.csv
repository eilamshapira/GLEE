"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $400000. Consider the impact of inflation on future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a larger share ($600,000 vs $400,000 for me), I need to carefully consider the impact of inflation. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round, meaning the total value would decrease to $900,000 for me. Any counterproposal would need to give me significantly more than $400,000 to offset this loss.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and each rejection costs me 10% in value, accepting this initial offer might be more rational than risking a potentially worse outcome through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. I'm offering an equal division of $500,000 each. As you mentioned, inflation affects my value by 10% each round, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $450000. Remember, inflation is affecting both of us, and we need to find a balance soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000, which is a positive step. She's also revealed that inflation is affecting her more severely than me (36% for her vs. 19% for me at this point). 

This is important information - if we continue negotiating, the total value of the money decreases more rapidly for her than for me, which potentially gives me some leverage. However, continuing to reject offers means we both lose value.

Since Alice has moved in my direction and the inflation penalty is higher for her, I'll accept this improved offer rather than risk further devaluation for both of us.
