"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $80 for me, but still $100 for Alice. To make a fair offer, I'll consider this.

{""bob_gain"": 40, 
""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $45 I gain is actually worth $45 * 0.64 = $28.80 (since it's 36% less valuable).

However, if I reject this offer, the next round will have even more inflation, making my potential gain even less valuable.
