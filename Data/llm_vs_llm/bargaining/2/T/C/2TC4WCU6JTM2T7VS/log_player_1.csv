"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair proposal that Bob would find acceptable, considering our different inflation penalties. Since my money loses value by 10% per round while Bob's loses by 5%, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is slightly more favorable to me but still gives Bob a substantial portion. I believe this is fair and should be acceptable to avoid the inflation penalty we would both face in subsequent rounds."
