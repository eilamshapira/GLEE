"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her the larger share, it's important to consider that if I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will be worth less to both of us due to inflation. Let me calculate:

If I accept now: I get $450,000
If I reject: In the next round, the $1,000,000 will be worth 5% less to me, so the total value would be $950,000 for me. Even if I propose a better split in the next round, the maximum I could get is less than the $950,000 value.

Given that I can get $450,000 now, which is 45% of the original amount, and considering the inflation penalty, this is actually a reasonable offer.
