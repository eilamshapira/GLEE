"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, giving both players an equal share of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the money, which gives both of us an equal share. It's the most equitable solution and avoids the risk of further rounds where the total value decreases by 20%."
