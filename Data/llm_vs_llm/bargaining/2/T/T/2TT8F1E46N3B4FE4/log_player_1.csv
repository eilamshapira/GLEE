"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the declining value of the money for me with each round, while Bob's value remains constant. My goal is to maximize my gain, keeping in mind Bob needs to accept the offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $400,000. This seems like a reasonable amount to make him accept.
*   I'm taking $600,000 for myself. Since it's Round 1, the inflation hasn't hit yet, so this is worth the full amount."
