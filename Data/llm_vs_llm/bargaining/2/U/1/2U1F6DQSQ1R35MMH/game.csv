550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a fair initial offer considering we both need to reach an agreement soon due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate in future rounds if needed, but remember that delays will reduce the overall value for me by 20% each round.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm also keen on a fair deal.  I propose we switch the amounts from your previous offer. This ensures we both feel the urgency of inflation while starting from a point where we both compromise.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest solution for both of us. Keep in mind that inflation is affecting me at 20% per round, so we should reach an agreement quickly. This equal split respects both our interests and avoids further devaluation of our shares. Let's finalize this deal now and both walk away with equal value.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but we need to factor in the inflation impact. I'm taking a hit with each round, and this offer reflects a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's slightly better for me than your initial offer but still keeps things balanced. Let's close this out now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
