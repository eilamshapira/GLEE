45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that the money is devaluing faster for me than for you. This is fair considering our different situations, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than continuing to later rounds where we both lose value.",Bob,2,
