"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that the money is devaluing faster for me than for you. This is fair considering our different situations, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than continuing to later rounds where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
