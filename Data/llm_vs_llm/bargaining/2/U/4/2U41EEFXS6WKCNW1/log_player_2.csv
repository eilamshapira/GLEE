"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 60, and you can have 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. In round 1, she's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. 

If I reject and move to round 2, the money would be worth 20% less to me (so $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me), while for Alice it would only be worth 5% less (so $100 would effectively be worth $95 to her).

Given this asymmetric inflation penalty, it seems better for me to make a counter-offer rather than accept this initial 60-40 split. In the next round, I could propose a more favorable split that accounts for the different inflation rates.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now but only 5% less to Alice, I should propose a division that reflects this asymmetry while still being acceptable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that the money is devaluing faster for me than for you. This is fair considering our different situations, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than continuing to later rounds where we both lose value.""}"
