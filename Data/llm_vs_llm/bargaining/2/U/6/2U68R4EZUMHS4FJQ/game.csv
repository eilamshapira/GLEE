5000.0,5000.0,Let's start with a fair split - 50/50. What do you think?,Alice,1,

2857.0,7143.0,"Alice, I’ve reflected on the impact of waiting and our respective discount factors. If we move to the next round, you’d be in the proposing seat but would face a 20% devaluation, while I’d face a 10% drop. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. This division leaves you just as well‐off as if you waited for your turn, so I believe it’s a fair offer that benefits us both by locking in value now. What do you say?",Bob,2,

3200.0,6800.0,"Given the inflation impact on both of us, how about $3200 for me and $6800 for you? It's more balanced for both sides compared to your offer.",Alice,3,
