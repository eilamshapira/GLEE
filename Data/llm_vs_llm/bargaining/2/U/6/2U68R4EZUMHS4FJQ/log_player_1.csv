"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I’ve reflected on the impact of waiting and our respective discount factors. If we move to the next round, you’d be in the proposing seat but would face a 20% devaluation, while I’d face a 10% drop. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. This division leaves you just as well‐off as if you waited for your turn, so I believe it’s a fair offer that benefits us both by locking in value now. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
