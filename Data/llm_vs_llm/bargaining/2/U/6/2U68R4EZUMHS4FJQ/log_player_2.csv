"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split - 50/50. What do you think?

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Alice, I’ve reflected on the impact of waiting and our respective discount factors. If we move to the next round, you’d be in the proposing seat but would face a 20% devaluation, while I’d face a 10% drop. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $7,143 and you receive $2,857. This division leaves you just as well‐off as if you waited for your turn, so I believe it’s a fair offer that benefits us both by locking in value now. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation impact on both of us, how about $3200 for me and $6800 for you? It's more balanced for both sides compared to your offer. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
