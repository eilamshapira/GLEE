"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round but doesn't affect Bob, I should make a reasonable offer now.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. The inflation penalty means I should try to reach an agreement quickly, but I also shouldn't give up too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
