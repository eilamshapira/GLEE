600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60/40 split. This is a generous offer, considering inflation will hurt me in later rounds but not you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,995000.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. Declining now means you’ll propose in round 3—but with a 20% penalty on your share, you'll be forced to offer nearly everything to Bob. I’m offering you $5000 now so you get a non‐zero payoff. Please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand the pressure, but I can't accept $5000. My money is now worth 20% less, so I'm adjusting my previous offer accordingly, taking that into account. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. If you accept, you are still getting a considerable sum without further risk or delay.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
857143.0,142857.0,"Alice, every minute you wait further, your share loses another 10% of its value. In round 5 you’d see your money worth only 60%, leaving you with roughly $600000 in real value. Accepting this offer now gives you $857143 nominally, which at the current 70% value amounts to about $600000—no worse than waiting, and it avoids further risk. Let's settle now.",Bob,4,
