"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a generous offer, considering inflation will hurt me in later rounds but not you.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 995000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is not on your side. Declining now means you’ll propose in round 3—but with a 20% penalty on your share, you'll be forced to offer nearly everything to Bob. I’m offering you $5,000 now so you get a non‐zero payoff. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure, but I can't accept $5000. My money is now worth 20% less, so I'm adjusting my previous offer accordingly, taking that into account. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. If you accept, you are still getting a considerable sum without further risk or delay. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 142857, ""alice_gain"": 857143, ""message"": ""Alice, every minute you wait further, your share loses another 10% of its value. In round 5 you’d see your money worth only 60%, leaving you with roughly $600,000 in real value. Accepting this offer now gives you $857,143 nominally, which at the current 70% value amounts to about $600,000—no worse than waiting, and it avoids further risk. Let's settle now.""}"
