600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I'm not heavily disadvantaged by the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Given that you face 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share will be worth significantly less next round. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your perspective, but considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a significant amount while helping me mitigate the inflation impact.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Let's be practical here. Due to inflation, your $350000 now is worth more than $550000 would be in two more rounds. I'm facing only 5% inflation per round while you're losing 20% each time. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances. We should conclude this now before further value is lost.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's meet in the middle. An equal split considers both our interests and the inflation rates we're facing. This way, we both get a fair share and can end the game satisfactorily.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Consider the economics carefully: Due to the 20% inflation you face per round, $300000 now is worth more to you than $500000 would be in just two more rounds. Meanwhile, I only lose 5% per round. This deal gives you substantial real value while accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will only reduce both our shares significantly.",Bob,6,
