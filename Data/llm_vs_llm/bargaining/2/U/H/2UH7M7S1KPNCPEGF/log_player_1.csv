# Bob's message: Let's be practical here. Due to inflation, your $350000 now is worth more than $550000 would be in two more rounds. I'm facing only 5% inflation per round while you're losing 20% each time. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances. We should conclude this now before further value is lost.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider the economics carefully: Due to the 20% inflation you face per round, $300000 now is worth more to you than $500000 would be in just two more rounds. Meanwhile, I only lose 5% per round. This deal gives you substantial real value while accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will only reduce both our shares significantly.
