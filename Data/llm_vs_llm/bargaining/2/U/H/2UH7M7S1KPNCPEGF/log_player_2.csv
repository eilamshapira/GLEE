"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I'm not heavily disadvantaged by the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The inflation impact is key here:
   - For me: 5% per round
   - For Alice: 20% per round
4. Alice is more heavily impacted by inflation, which gives me leverage
5. Given the significant inflation difference, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer
6. A 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems too generous given her worse inflation position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money in this round is worth:
- For me: 95% of original value
- For Alice: 80% of original value

Given Alice's much higher inflation penalty, I should propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further value loss.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Given that you face 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share will be worth significantly less next round. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a significant amount while helping me mitigate the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has improved her offer from $400k to $450k for me
2. Current value due to inflation:
   - My $450k is worth $406,125 (90.25% of original value)
   - Alice's $550k is worth $352,000 (64% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be about 15%
   - Alice's will be about 50%
   - This gives me even more leverage
4. The split is still favoring Alice (55/45) despite her worse inflation position
5. We still have 9 rounds left, and Alice's position weakens more quickly than mine

Given these factors, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting and making another offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me calculate the current situation:

The money in this round is worth:
- For me: ~85.7% of original value
- For Alice: ~51.2% of original value

Alice's position is deteriorating much faster than mine. She's now lost nearly half the value, while I've only lost about 14%. This strongly incentivizes her to reach an agreement soon.

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. Due to inflation, your $350,000 now is worth more than $550,000 would be in two more rounds. I'm facing only 5% inflation per round while you're losing 20% each time. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances. We should conclude this now before further value is lost.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. An equal split considers both our interests and the inflation rates we're facing. This way, we both get a fair share and can end the game satisfactorily. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split
2. Current value due to inflation:
   - My $500k is worth $407,250 (81.45% of original value)
   - Alice's $500k is worth $204,800 (40.96% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be around 23.5%
   - Alice's will be around 67%
   - Alice is losing value much faster than I am
4. Even with a 50/50 split, I'm getting significantly more real value due to the inflation difference
5. However, we still have 7 rounds left, and Alice's position continues to weaken faster than mine
6. An equal nominal split when Alice faces 4x worse inflation isn't optimal for me

I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me calculate the current situation:

The money in this round is worth:
- For me: ~77.4% of original value
- For Alice: ~32.8% of original value

Alice has lost over 67% of her potential value while I've only lost about 23%. Her negotiating position is significantly weakened. However, I should also be mindful that we need to reach an agreement within 6 more rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Consider the economics carefully: Due to the 20% inflation you face per round, $300,000 now is worth more to you than $500,000 would be in just two more rounds. Meanwhile, I only lose 5% per round. This deal gives you substantial real value while accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will only reduce both our shares significantly.""}"
