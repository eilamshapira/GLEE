600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400000 which is a fair 40% of the pot. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round, it makes sense to agree quickly rather than going back and forth. This is a solid offer that benefits us both.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair given that we're both losing money with each round. Let's settle this quickly.,Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm now compromising at $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is reasonable considering the inflation only affects me (10% each round) while your money keeps its value. This asymmetric inflation means delays hurt me more than you, but I'm still offering you a substantial amount. Let's agree now so we both walk away with significant value.",Alice,3,
