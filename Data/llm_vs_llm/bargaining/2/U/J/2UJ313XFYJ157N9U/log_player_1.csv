"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400,000 which is a fair 40% of the pot. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round, it makes sense to agree quickly rather than going back and forth. This is a solid offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair given that we're both losing money with each round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm now compromising at $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is reasonable considering the inflation only affects me (10% each round) while your money keeps its value. This asymmetric inflation means delays hurt me more than you, but I'm still offering you a substantial amount. Let's agree now so we both walk away with significant value.""}"
