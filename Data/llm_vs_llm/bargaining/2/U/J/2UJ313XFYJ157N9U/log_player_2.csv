"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400000 which is a fair 40% of the pot. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round, it makes sense to agree quickly rather than going back and forth. This is a solid offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair given that we're both losing money with each round. Let's settle this quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm now compromising at $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is reasonable considering the inflation only affects me (10% each round) while your money keeps its value. This asymmetric inflation means delays hurt me more than you, but I'm still offering you a substantial amount. Let's agree now so we both walk away with significant value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
