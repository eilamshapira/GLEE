"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, I can make a counter-proposal
- However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less
- $400,000 now is worth more than $440,000 in the next round (which would be equivalent to $400,000 after 10% inflation)

Alice's current offer gives me 40% of the total sum, which is not terrible considering:
1. I'd need to secure significantly more in the next round to offset inflation
2. Alice might reject my counter-proposal, leading to even more rounds and inflation

Given these factors, while the split isn't entirely in my favor, accepting now is likely better than risking further negotiations with guaranteed value loss.
