Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer you 55, Alice, and I'll take 45. Inflation is tough, but let's make a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember the money is losing value quickly! I'll adjust my offer, hoping Bob understands the urgency. Taking into account inflation and trying to be reasonable...

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 53,
  ""bob_gain"": 47,
  ""message"": ""Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering you 47, leaving me with 53. It's a slight compromise from my initial ask, but a much better deal than letting the money depreciate further. Let's end this now!""
