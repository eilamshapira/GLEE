Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45,""alice_gain"": 55,""message"": ""I'll offer you 55, Alice, and I'll take 45. Inflation is tough, but let's make a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering you 47, leaving me with 53. It's a slight compromise from my initial ask, but a much better deal than letting the money depreciate further. Let's end this now! 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53
