"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob. Considering that we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds and that I face 5% inflation per round, I'll start with a reasonable proposal that gives me a slight advantage but is fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Since I'm making the first offer, I'm proposing to take $550,000 (55%) and give Bob $450,000 (45%). This is a fair starting point that acknowledges the time pressure we both face, while still giving me a bit more than half."
