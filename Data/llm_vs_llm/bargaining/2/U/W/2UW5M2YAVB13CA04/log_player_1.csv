"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money a bit more evenly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a good share, and I hope it'll encourage you to accept so we can avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept now:
- I get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4050
- Bob gets $5500, with 5% inflation it's worth $5225 for him

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- Money will be worth 20% less for me
- Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again
- Further delays mean more value lost to inflation

Given that the current offer gives me a reasonable amount and avoiding further inflation is crucial, I should accept.
