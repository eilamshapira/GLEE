550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving me $550000 and you $450000. Accepting this offer now avoids further inflation penalties on my share, and I believe it’s a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm going to take a slightly different approach. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. I think this is a fairer reflection of our respective contributions to this game, given that you're the one proposing first.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not comfortable with receiving $400000 in round 2 given the inflation penalty on my share. Let's see if we can craft a more balanced offer in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, since each passing round erodes the value of my share further, I’d like to cut to the chase. I'm proposing 520000 for me and 480000 for you. This offer gives me a better outcome than your previous one while still providing you a competitive share. Let’s settle it now rather than risk further losses on my end. What do you say?",Alice,3,
