Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 by giving me $550,000 and you $450,000. Accepting this offer now avoids further inflation penalties on my share, and I believe it’s a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm going to take a slightly different approach. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. I think this is a fairer reflection of our respective contributions to this game, given that you're the one proposing first.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not comfortable with receiving $400,000 in round 2 given the inflation penalty on my share. Let's see if we can craft a more balanced offer in the next round.""}"

Let’s settle it now rather than risk further losses on my end. What do you say?""}"
