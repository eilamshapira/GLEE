Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving me $550000 and you $450000. Accepting this offer now avoids further inflation penalties on my share, and I believe it’s a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since each passing round erodes the value of my share further, I’d like to cut to the chase. I'm proposing 520000 for me and 480000 for you. This offer gives me a better outcome than your previous one while still providing you a competitive share. Let’s settle it now rather than risk further losses on my end. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
