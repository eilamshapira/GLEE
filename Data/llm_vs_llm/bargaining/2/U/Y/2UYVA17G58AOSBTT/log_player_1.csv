Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":50,""bob_gain"":50,""message"":""Let's split it equally to start. Fair for both!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since money loses 20% value each round for you but not for me, waiting is more costly for you. A 60-40 split in my favor recognizes this time preference difference while still giving you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
