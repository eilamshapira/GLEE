"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally to start. Fair for both! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. While this is a common ""fair"" split, I need to consider our different time preferences. Since money doesn't lose value for me over rounds, but Alice faces 20% inflation per round, I'm in a stronger negotiating position.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice would need to consider that $50 in round 2 is only worth $40 to her (due to 20% inflation). This gives me leverage to ask for more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll leverage my stronger position due to Alice's time discount factor, but still make a reasonable offer that's likely to be accepted.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since money loses 20% value each round for you but not for me, waiting is more costly for you. A 60-40 split in my favor recognizes this time preference difference while still giving you a substantial amount.""}"
