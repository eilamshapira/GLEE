"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll offer Bob a fair split, but considering the 20% per round inflation penalty he faces, he should be motivated to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly equal 50-50 split. I propose we both get $5,000. It's fair and reasonable, and if Bob declines, his next round's money will be worth 20% less to him."
