"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is giving me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. Since this is the first round, I need to consider whether I should accept or try to negotiate for more in the next round, keeping in mind the 10% inflation per round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me (meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me). Even if I were to get a larger share in the next round, I need to weigh that against this depreciation.

I think I can do better than this initial 40/60 split, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the 10% inflation I've already incurred while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that benefits both of us, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation where the value continues to decrease for me due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $450,000 instead of the initial $400,000. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

Due to inflation, the $450,000 is worth 19% less to me than it would have been in round 1. That means it's effectively worth $450,000 Ã— 0.81 = $364,500 to me in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we move to round 4, the money will be worth even less to me (29% less than round 1). Even if I could get a better split in the next round, the increasing inflation diminishes my potential gains.

Alice's improved offer shows she's willing to negotiate, and given the asymmetric inflation that affects only me, I should accept before the money loses more value.
