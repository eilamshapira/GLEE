"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me.

If I reject, the total value to me would be reduced to $950,000, and I'd have to propose a split that Alice would accept. I could potentially get more than $400,000, but I need to consider whether the potential gain outweighs the guaranteed loss from inflation.

Since $400,000 is a substantial amount and I'm facing guaranteed depreciation if I move to another round, I'll accept this offer.
