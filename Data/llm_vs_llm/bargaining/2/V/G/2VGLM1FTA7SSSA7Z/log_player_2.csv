"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance. However, if I reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me (making the $100 worth only $90 from my perspective).

The current offer gives me $50. If I reject, the best I could reasonably hope for in the next round would be getting a larger share of $90 (from my perspective). Even if I proposed taking $60 and giving Alice $30 in the next round, she might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value decay.

Given these considerations, I should accept this fair first-round offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
