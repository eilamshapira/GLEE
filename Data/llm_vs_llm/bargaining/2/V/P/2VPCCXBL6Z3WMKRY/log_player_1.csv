Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, accounting for the 20% inflation hit I took in Round 2, and needing to make Bob an offer he's likely to accept after rejecting a 60/40 split *and* understanding he proposed a 40/60 split, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle, but still remembering my risk.
