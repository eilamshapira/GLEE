"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000 out of the $10,000. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be worth 90% of the original amount, or $9000 in effective value. I could potentially get more than $4000 in that scenario.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, a 50-50 split seems fair. This way we both get an equal share, and we can avoid further rounds where the total value would decrease for me due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is now offering me $4200, which is a slight improvement from her initial $4000 offer. However, due to inflation, this $4200 is worth 19% less to me than money in round 1, meaning its effective value to me is about $3402 ($4200 Ã— 0.81).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the inflation will increase to around 29% for me (compounding the 10% per round). This means even if I got a better split, the money would be worth less.

Alice has also disclosed that her inflation rate (9.75%) is lower than mine (19%), which puts me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.

Given this asymmetric inflation and the increasing penalty for delaying agreement, I should accept this offer.
