"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's the first round, so I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate
2. The split (40/60) favors Alice significantly
3. I'm not affected by inflation, so I can safely negotiate in later rounds
4. There's no immediate pressure to accept a suboptimal offer

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a fair proposal that gives me a slight advantage but isn't too greedy. It's more equitable than Alice's initial offer, and since there's no inflation pressure on my end, I can afford to negotiate reasonably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from 40 to 45
2. Alice is experiencing inflation (9.75% loss in value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation
4. There are still 9 rounds remaining
5. Alice's inflation penalty suggests she might become more willing to compromise in later rounds

While this offer is better than the first one, I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since Alice is facing inflation pressure and I'm not.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice is facing inflation and has shown willingness to improve her offers, I'll propose a slightly better split for myself while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a moderate increase from my previous offer (55/45)
2. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it
3. Alice faces increasing inflation pressure, so she might be more inclined to accept
4. It still leaves room for negotiation if rejected"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer again (from 45 to 50)
2. Alice's inflation penalty has increased significantly (18.55%)
3. For Alice, her 50 is actually worth about 41 (after inflation)
4. I'm still not affected by inflation
5. This is a seemingly fair 50/50 split nominally
6. We still have 7 rounds remaining

Given that Alice is facing significant inflation pressure and has been steadily improving offers, I believe I can still get a better deal. The fact that she's moved from 40 to 45 to 50 for my share suggests she might go higher.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has shown a pattern of increasing offers and is facing significant inflation (18.55%), I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a moderate increase from my previous offer (58/42)
2. With Alice's current inflation rate, her 40 is worth about 32.6 to her
3. She might be more willing to accept a lower nominal amount now rather than risk further inflation
4. If she rejects, I still have room to negotiate in future rounds
5. It's not so extreme as to appear unfair, given the circumstances"
