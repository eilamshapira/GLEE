"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this split because I need to account for potential inflation if Bob rejects it, and it still leaves Bob with a substantial portion. I'm offering you 60% and giving you 40% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's actually worth $40 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offer is equal split, which seems fair, but the inflation makes it less attractive for me
4. We still have many rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing

Given that inflation will keep eating into my gains if I continue negotiating, and that Bob might make worse offers in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
