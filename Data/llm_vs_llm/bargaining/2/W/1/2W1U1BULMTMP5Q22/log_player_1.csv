"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation risk for both parties. Since I'm going first and Bob has less inflation pressure (5% vs 10%), I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose this split to acknowledge that if Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation, with me losing more. This fair offer should incentivize immediate acceptance."
