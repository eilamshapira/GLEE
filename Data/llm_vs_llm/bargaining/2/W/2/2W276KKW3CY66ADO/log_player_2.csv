"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a quick settlement: I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. Settling now avoids the 20% inflation hit on my side and, in my view, is fair enough to keep things moving smoothly. Looking forward to your thoughts. â€“Alice 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
