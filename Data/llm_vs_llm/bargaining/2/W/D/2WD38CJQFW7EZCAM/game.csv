300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, as we step into round 2, your potential gains are already starting to erode by 5% each round. To avoid further losses on your side and to secure a fair deal promptly, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor now. I believe this reflects the urgency of acting quickly rather than risking more inflation. Please consider this offer and let's conclude our negotiations.",Bob,2,

470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Given that your money is now worth only about 85.74% of its original value due to inflation, waiting for a later round would only reduce your effective gains further. To strike a fair balance in round 4, I propose a nominal split where you receive 470000 and I receive 530000. This gives you an effective value of roughly 470000 × 0.8574 ≈ 402000, which is a safeguard against further erosion. I believe this offer recognizes the inflationary impact on your share while allowing us to settle promptly. I hope you see the benefit of accepting this proposal now.",Bob,4,

540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, as we enter round 6 your funds are now worth about 77.38% of their face value, compared to roughly 73.51% if we move to round 7. With this additional cost to waiting, I propose we settle now with me receiving $460000 and you receiving $540000. This gives you an immediate effective benefit of approximately $540000 × 0.7738 ≈ $417850 – a notable improvement over what further delay would offer. Let’s avoid additional losses and conclude this deal now.",Bob,6,
