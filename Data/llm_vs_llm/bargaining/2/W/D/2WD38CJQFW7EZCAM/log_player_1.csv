Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we step into round 2, your potential gains are already starting to erode by 5% each round. To avoid further losses on your side and to secure a fair deal promptly, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor now. I believe this reflects the urgency of acting quickly rather than risking more inflation. Please consider this offer and let's conclude our negotiations.

# Bob gain: 700000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Given that your money is now worth only about 85.74% of its original value due to inflation, waiting for a later round would only reduce your effective gains further. To strike a fair balance in round 4, I propose a nominal split where you receive 470000 and I receive 530000. This gives you an effective value of roughly 470000 × 0.8574 ≈ 402000, which is a safeguard against further erosion. I believe this offer recognizes the inflationary impact on your share while allowing us to settle promptly. I hope you see the benefit of accepting this proposal now.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we enter round 6 your funds are now worth about 77.38% of their face value, compared to roughly 73.51% if we move to round 7. With this additional cost to waiting, I propose we settle now with me receiving $460000 and you receiving $540000. This gives you an immediate effective benefit of approximately $540000 × 0.7738 ≈ $417850 – a notable improvement over what further delay would offer. Let’s avoid additional losses and conclude this deal now.
