Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, as we step into round 2, your potential gains are already starting to erode by 5% each round. To avoid further losses on your side and to secure a fair deal promptly, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor now. I believe this reflects the urgency of acting quickly rather than risking more inflation. Please consider this offer and let's conclude our negotiations.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Given that your money is now worth only about 85.74% of its original value due to inflation, waiting for a later round would only reduce your effective gains further. To strike a fair balance in round 4, I propose a nominal split where you receive 470,000 and I receive 530,000. This gives you an effective value of roughly 470,000 × 0.8574 ≈ 402,000, which is a safeguard against further erosion. I believe this offer recognizes the inflationary impact on your share while allowing us to settle promptly. I hope you see the benefit of accepting this proposal now.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, as we enter round 6 your funds are now worth about 77.38% of their face value, compared to roughly 73.51% if we move to round 7. With this additional cost to waiting, I propose we settle now with me receiving $460,000 and you receiving $540,000. This gives you an immediate effective benefit of approximately $540,000 × 0.7738 ≈ $417,850 – a notable improvement over what further delay would offer. Let’s avoid additional losses and conclude this deal now.""}"
