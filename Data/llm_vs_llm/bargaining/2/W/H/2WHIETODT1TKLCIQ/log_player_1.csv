"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since this is the first round and inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me but not too greedy.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives me a modest advantage
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation
3. It's reasonable enough that Bob should consider accepting rather than waiting for a better deal while the total value decreases"
