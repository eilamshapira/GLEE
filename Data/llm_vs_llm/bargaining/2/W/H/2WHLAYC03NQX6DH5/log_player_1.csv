I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  I figure it's a good starting point, and hopefully he'll see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
