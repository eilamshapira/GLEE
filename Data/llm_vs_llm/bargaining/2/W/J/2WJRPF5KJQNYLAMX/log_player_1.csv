"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer that gives both players a good portion while keeping a slight advantage for myself as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable split giving Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I want to make an attractive offer that Bob is likely to accept early, avoiding prolonged negotiations."
