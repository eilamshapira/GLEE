"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives us both a fair amount and allows us to end the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
- This is the first round, so I have plenty of opportunities to counter
- A 60-40 split favoring her isn't particularly fair when we have equal negotiating power
- I can propose a more equitable split in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money since we're both equal participants in this game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a substantial amount and can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's new offer:
- She's moved from 60-40 to 55-45, showing willingness to compromise
- I would get $4,500, which is better than her first offer
- However, we still have 9 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation
- The split is still favoring her without clear justification
- I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a slight adjustment from 50-50 to show I'm also willing to compromise:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Here's my counter-offer with a slight advantage to me, similar to how you proposed a slight advantage for yourself. We can meet in the middle and finish this soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to split the money with a slight advantage for me, similar to your last proposal. Let's end this game soon. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is actually a very fair offer from Alice. She's now proposing exactly the same proportions I just proposed, just reversed. This shows:
1. She's willing to be fair and reasonable
2. We're converging on a nearly equal split
3. The difference is now just $400 between us
4. We've both shown flexibility in negotiations
5. With 7 rounds left, we could waste time haggling over a small difference
