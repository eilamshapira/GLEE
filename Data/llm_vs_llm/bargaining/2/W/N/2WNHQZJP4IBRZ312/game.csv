60.0,40.0,Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you $40 while I get $60 since I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is a good deal for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, getting ahead now is important for me. I believe this is a fair offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I had to reject your offer because with 20% total inflation penalty for me now, I need a larger share to get fair value. I'm offering you $35 while I get $65 - this actually gives us similar real value considering my inflation penalty.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time with these unequal offers.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split.  This ensures we both benefit from this exercise.  Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, with 34.4% total inflation penalty for me now, a 50/50 split would actually give me much less real value than you. My $70 after inflation is worth about $46, while your $30 is worth $30. This makes it more equitable in real terms.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I'm sticking with 50/50.  It's a fair split regardless of how you try to spin the inflation.  Let's close this out.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,accept
