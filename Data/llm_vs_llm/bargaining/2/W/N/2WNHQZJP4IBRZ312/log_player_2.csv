"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you $40 while I get $60 since I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, getting ahead now is important for me. I believe this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I had to reject your offer because with 20% total inflation penalty for me now, I need a larger share to get fair value. I'm offering you $35 while I get $65 - this actually gives us similar real value considering my inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is exaggerating the impact of inflation. A 10% reduction twice is not a 20% reduction total. I need to hold firm for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time with these unequal offers.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split.  This ensures we both benefit from this exercise.  Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with 34.4% total inflation penalty for me now, a 50/50 split would actually give me much less real value than you. My $70 after inflation is worth about $46, while your $30 is worth $30. This makes it more equitable in real terms. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate and using misleading math. I need to hold firm, she'll likely offer a better deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking with 50/50.  It's a fair split regardless of how you try to spin the inflation.  Let's close this out.""}"
