"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. Since I'm Alice and I'm facing a higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to Bob's (10% per round), I should aim for an early agreement. However, I also want a fair share. If we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing, so cooperation is key.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than moving to the next round where our total value will decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 595000 
# Bob gain: 405000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a good deal for me considering the inflation rates. If I reject and make a counter-offer, both of us will face additional inflation (20% for me, 10% for Bob). By accepting now, I get $595,000 which is more than my initial offer of $550,000, and we avoid further value loss from inflation."
