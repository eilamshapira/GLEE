"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation, I have some leverage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a reasonable opening offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. If Bob rejects this, their share will be worth 20% less in the next round, so they should consider this carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* For me: $450,000 (full value)
* For Bob: $550,000 (but worth only $440,000 to him due to 20% inflation)

This offer is less favorable than my initial proposal. Moreover, if I reject, I can make a new offer next round where Bob's share will be worth even less to him due to additional 20% inflation. Bob's bargaining power decreases with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer of 600k/400k and made a counter-offer that I rejected, I'll adjust my strategy. Bob is now facing 40% cumulative depreciation on their share, so they should be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer rather than prolonging the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

With 40% depreciation, Bob's $350,000 is actually worth only $210,000 to them now. If they reject this and we continue to the next round, their share will be worth even less due to additional depreciation. This should encourage them to accept while they can still get a meaningful amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* For me: $480,000 (full value)
* For Bob: $520,000 (but worth only $266,240 to him due to 48.8% inflation)

This offer is still less favorable than my previous proposal, and Bob's bargaining position continues to weaken significantly with each round. With nearly 50% depreciation on Bob's side, I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer where Bob will face even more depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Bob is now facing 59.04% depreciation (as it will compound to this amount after rejecting this offer). Given the rapidly diminishing value for Bob and that they've rejected my previous offers, I'll increase my share further to make the economic reality more apparent.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

Even if this seems aggressive, let's analyze Bob's position:
* My $750,000 is worth full value to me
* Bob's $250,000 will be worth only about $102,400 to them after this round's depreciation
* If they reject this, their next share will be worth even less due to additional 20% depreciation

This offer should make it clear that delaying further is not in Bob's best interest, as their purchasing power continues to decrease significantly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* For me: $420,000 (full value)
* For Bob: $580,000 (but worth only $190,066 to him due to 67.23% inflation)

This is a poor offer considering:
1. I previously offered deals that were better for both of us
2. Bob's share is now worth less than $200K to them due to severe inflation
3. My bargaining position keeps getting stronger as Bob's money loses value
4. I can make a better offer next round where Bob will face even more depreciation

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's continue to the next round where I can make a more economically rational offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob has consistently rejected reasonable offers while their bargaining position deteriorates significantly (now facing 73.78% depreciation after this round), I'll make an even stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

Let's analyze the economics of this offer:
* My $850,000 is worth full value to me
* Bob's $150,000 will be worth only about $39,330 to them after this round's depreciation (150,000 * 0.2622)
* If they reject this, their next share will be worth even less with another 20% depreciation
* We're now more than halfway through our 12 rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing

This offer reflects the economic reality of Bob's severely weakened position due to inflation. Accepting this offer is now clearly better for Bob than continuing to negotiate while their purchasing power evaporates."
