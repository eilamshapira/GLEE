"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a fair offer considering the devaluation. 

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get. Since it's 36% less, I'll get approximately 64% of the face value.

For 350000, I'd get around 0.64 * 350000 = 224000.

Given this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, and it's already worth 36% less after round 3 (or 20% + 16% = 36% less, which is 1 - 0.2 - 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.36), I'll make a new offer considering the further devaluation. 

In round 4, the money is worth 20% * 0.8 + 36% = 44% less for me (or 1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36, then 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16, 0.36 + 0.16 * 0.8 = 0.44, approximately, but to simplify: after round 3 it was 36% less, now after round 4 it will be 20% more less, so it will be 36% + (20% of the remaining 64%) = 36% + 12.8% = 48.8% less, I will use 48% for simplicity).

I'll aim for a split where I get a bit more than half of the remaining value, considering the devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get. Since it's 59.04% less, I'll get approximately 40.96% of the face value.

For 250000, I'd get around 0.4096 * 250000 = 102400.

Given this significant devaluation, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount, as the value of the money decreases rapidly for me.

However, Alice's offer seems quite low, considering I'm the one affected by inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 59.04% less for me after round 5, and it will be worth even less after this round, I'll make a new offer considering the further devaluation. 

In round 6, the money is worth approximately 59.04% + (20% of the remaining 40.96%) = 59.04% + 8.19% = 67.23% less for me.

I'll aim for a split where I get a significant portion, considering the rapid devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get. Since it's 73.79% less, I'll get approximately 26.21% of the face value.

For 150000, I'd get around 0.2621 * 150000 = 39315.

Given this extreme devaluation, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me any reasonable amount, as the value of the money decreases rapidly for me.

Alice's offer is low, but considering the devaluation, it might be better than risking further losses.
