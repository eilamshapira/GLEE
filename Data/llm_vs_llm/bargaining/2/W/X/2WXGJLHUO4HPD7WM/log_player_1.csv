"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to my 5% per round, he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor, with the following reasoning to Bob: ""Given that your money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), accepting this fair offer now would be more beneficial than waiting for future rounds where your share would be worth significantly less."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $400,000 at 95% value = $380,000 effective value
- Bob gets $600,000 at 80% value = $480,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- But my money will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's money will be worth another 20% less
- This gives me leverage in the next round as Bob's position weakens faster

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, given that Bob's money devalues much faster than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3:
- My money is worth 90% of original value
- Bob's money is worth 60% of original value

Bob's position has weakened significantly due to his higher inflation rate. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for me, while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept given his rapid value loss.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'll explain to Bob: ""Given that your money is now worth only 60% of its original value while mine is still at 90%, this offer gives you $210,000 in effective value (350,000 × 0.6). If you reject and we continue, your money will lose another 20% of value, making future gains significantly less valuable for you. This is your best opportunity to maximize your actual value."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $450,000 at 85.74% value = $385,830 effective value
- Bob gets $550,000 at 51.2% value = $281,600 effective value

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- My money will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's money will be worth another 20% less
- Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken significantly faster than mine

Since Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine, I have a stronger negotiating position by waiting. I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Bob's share will be worth even less to him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point:
- My money is worth about 81% of original value
- Bob's money is worth about 41% of original value

Bob's position has weakened considerably, and the rapid depreciation of his share should make him more eager to reach an agreement. I'll propose a split that reflects this changing bargaining power while still giving him enough incentive to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'll explain to Bob: ""Your share is now only worth 41% of its original value, meaning this $300,000 offer is effectively worth $123,000 to you. If you reject this offer, your next round's money will only be worth about 33% of the original value, making any future gains significantly less valuable. This is a good time to accept and secure real value rather than risk further depreciation."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $500,000 at 77.38% value = $386,900 effective value
- Bob gets $500,000 at 32.77% value = $163,850 effective value

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- My money will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's money will be worth another 20% less
- Bob's money is rapidly approaching a very low effective value

Even though this is a 50-50 split nominally, due to the inflation rates, I'm getting much more effective value. However, given that Bob's money is devaluing so rapidly, I can likely get an even better deal in the next round. The dramatic difference in our inflation rates (5% vs 20%) continues to strengthen my negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point:
- My money is worth about 73.5% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only about 26.2% of original value

Given the severe devaluation of Bob's share and the fact that we're more than halfway through our rounds, I'll make an aggressive offer that still gives Bob enough incentive to accept rather than risk further massive devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'll explain to Bob: ""At current values, your $250,000 share is effectively worth only $65,500 to you (250,000 × 0.262). If you reject this offer, your next round's money will only be worth about 21% of the original value. We're more than halfway through our rounds, and your negotiating position is weakening rapidly. This offer gives you meaningful value now, while waiting will only result in your share being worth even less."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $550,000 at 69.83% value = $384,065 effective value
- Bob gets $450,000 at 20.97% value = $94,365 effective value

2. If I reject:
- We'll be entering round 9 of 12 (getting close to the end)
- My money will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's money will be worth another 20% less
- Bob's effective value is already extremely low

Given that:
1. We're getting closer to the deadline (4 rounds left)
2. This offer gives me a decent effective value
3. There's always the risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement (where we both get nothing)
4. The incremental gains from waiting might not be worth the risk

I think it's prudent to accept this offer now.
