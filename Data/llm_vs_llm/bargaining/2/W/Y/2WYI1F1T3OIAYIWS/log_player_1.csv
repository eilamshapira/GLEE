"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be appealing enough for Bob to accept given the inflation and the limited number of rounds. I'll aim for a generous split that still benefits me substantially.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 2.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less, Bob's is worth 10% less.

Here's the critical question: Is $45 (with 20% less value) better than what I might get if I reject and make an offer in Round 3, considering *my* inflation and *Bob's* inflation by then? Also, keep in mind that with each round, we get closer to the deadline where we both get nothing.

Let's do a quick calculation to compare the value of $45 now versus waiting:

Value of $45 now: $45 * (1 - 0.20) = $45 * 0.8 = $36

If I reject, I have to offer Bob enough to make him accept *despite* his inflation. If I offer him, say, a bare minimum of $56 next round (meaning I get $44), its *actual* value will be even lower because of the round 3 inflation on both our end. With 40% inflation on my end now, and 20% on Bob's end, this translates to only getting $26.4. This is a bad deal.

Therefore, even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it and hoping for a better outcome in Round 3 seems riskier, especially with the deadline looming.
