"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 each. This is fair on its face, but I should remember that with each round that passes, inflation reduces the value of my share by 10%. If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total pot will effectively be worth less to me.

If I accept now: I get $5,000
If I reject and try to get more next round: I would need to secure more than $5,556 ($5,000 รท 0.9) to come out ahead after inflation.

Given the uncertainty about Alice's inflation rate and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I should accept this reasonable first offer.
