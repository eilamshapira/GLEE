"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects me, I should aim for a somewhat higher share to account for potential value loss if negotiations extend.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split as a reasonable starting point that gives both of us a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $500,000 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $400,000
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- My initial offer of $600,000 (which would have been worth $600,000) was rejected
- This is a fair 50-50 split, though worth less to me now
- Continuing to negotiate will only decrease the value further for me
- Bob might make an even less favorable offer in future rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the offer because continuing would only reduce the real value I receive due to inflation."
