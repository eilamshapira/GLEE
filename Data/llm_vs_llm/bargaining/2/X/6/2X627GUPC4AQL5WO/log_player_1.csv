"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering I need to account for potential inflation if negotiations extend further.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair opening offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I'm offering slightly more to myself because I know I'm affected by inflation in future rounds, but I'm still leaving Bob with a substantial amount to show I'm willing to negotiate reasonably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
$4500 * 0.8 = $3600 effective value for me

If I reject and we continue to the next round, any future amount will be worth even less due to compounding inflation. While I'd prefer a larger share, the diminishing value makes waiting risky.

Bob's offer, while giving them the larger portion, still gives me a reasonable amount. Given the inflation pressure, it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further devaluation.
