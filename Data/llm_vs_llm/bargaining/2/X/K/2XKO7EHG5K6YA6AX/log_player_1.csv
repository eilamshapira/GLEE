"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that I (Alice) face 10% inflation per round if this gets prolonged.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to offer Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation risk. If Bob rejects this and we go to further rounds, my purchasing power will decrease by 10% each round, so I need to protect myself with a slightly larger initial share. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob 45% of the total amount."
