"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial share while maintaining a slight advantage for making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is too unfavorable. As we move to the next round, I'll have another chance to make a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, still aiming for fairness but acknowledging the back-and-forth nature of our negotiation:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a completely fair 50-50 split that should be hard to reject on principle. It shows I'm willing to be reasonable and seek an equitable solution."
