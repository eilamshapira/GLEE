Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair given that I'm not affected by inflation. Let's settle on this and avoid further devaluation of the money for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
