"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose you get $1 and I keep $99. If you reject, you'll get to propose in the next roundâ€”but remember, any money you receive then will be worth 10% less due to inflation. Given that waiting only erodes your share and my value remains intact, I believe this offer is in your best interest. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a more balanced split. I think 40 for me and 60 for you is fair, given that any subsequent rounds will reduce my share's value. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
