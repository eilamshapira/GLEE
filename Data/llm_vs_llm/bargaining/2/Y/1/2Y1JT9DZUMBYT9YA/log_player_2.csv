"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose you get $1 and I keep $99. If you reject, you'll get to propose in the next roundâ€”but remember, any money you receive then will be worth 10% less due to inflation. Given that waiting only erodes your share and my value remains intact, I believe this offer is in your best interest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a more balanced split. I think 40 for me and 60 for you is fair, given that any subsequent rounds will reduce my share's value.""}"
