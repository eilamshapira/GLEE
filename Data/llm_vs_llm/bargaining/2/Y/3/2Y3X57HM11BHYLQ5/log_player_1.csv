"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. Since I face 20% inflation per round, it's important for me to secure a reasonable amount early, but I also want to make an offer that Bob will find acceptable to avoid further rounds where my share would lose value."
