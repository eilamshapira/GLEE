"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000 at full value
   * This is a substantial amount, though less than half

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be $900,000 but at 90% value = $810,000

3. Considerations:
   * $400,000 is a decent first offer
   * The inflation penalty makes waiting risky
   * I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation
   * We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky. $400,000 at full value is better than potentially getting nothing or a depreciated amount later.
