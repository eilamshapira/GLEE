350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Bob, we're now in Round 3 and time is running against me—every round costs me 10% of my share's value. To avoid further loss, I propose a swift agreement: I'll take $350K and you get $650K. This deal saves us time and prevents additional depreciation on my side. I believe it's a fair solution given the circumstances. Let's settle this now before the value drops further!",Alice,3,
