"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the amount equally at $500K each. This offer is fair for both of us. Let's wrap this up quickly to avoid further depreciation! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I believe it's a fair solution given the circumstances. Let's settle this now before the value drops further!""}"
