"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my Round 1 proposal: I take $600K and you get $400K. I believe it’s a fair starting point, but please note that any delay costs me—money depreciates 10% each round for me. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we split the amount equally at $500K each. This offer is fair for both of us. Let's wrap this up quickly to avoid further depreciation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now in Round 3 and time is running against me—every round costs me 10% of my share's value. To avoid further loss, I propose a swift agreement: I'll take $350K and you get $650K. This deal saves us time and prevents additional depreciation on my side. I believe it's a fair solution given the circumstances. Let's settle this now before the value drops further! 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000
