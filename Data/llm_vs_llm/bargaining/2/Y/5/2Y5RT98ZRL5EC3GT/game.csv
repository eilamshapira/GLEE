35.0,65.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further losses (my share drops 20% per round while yours only 5%), I’m offering a quick settlement: $35 for me and $65 for you. I believe this split respects both our incentives, and it’s best to agree now before waiting devalues the pot further. What do you say?",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the devaluation rates, I think this split is more fair. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer. However, getting $30 nominal in this round means my share is worth only 80% of that compared to the start – effectively $24 in round‑1 value. I believe that if we continue, as I’ll be making the proposal next round, there’s room for a more favorable arrangement for me before further discounts take their toll. Let’s proceed to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
26.0,74.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are getting higher in terms of lost value – my share is now effectively just 64% of its nominal value, while yours is about 90%. With that in mind, I’m offering you $74 (which amounts to roughly $66.8 in round‑1 terms for you) and keeping $26 for myself. This offer ensures you won’t do any better by delaying to round 4, where further devaluation will hurt us both. I believe this is a fair, loss–minimizing split. Let’s settle now before the pot shrinks even more!",Alice,3,
