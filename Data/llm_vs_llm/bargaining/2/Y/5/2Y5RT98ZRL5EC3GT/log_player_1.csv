"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further losses (my share drops 20% per round while yours only 5%), I’m offering a quick settlement: $35 for me and $65 for you. I believe this split respects both our incentives, and it’s best to agree now before waiting devalues the pot further. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the devaluation rates, I think this split is more fair. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer. However, getting $30 nominal in this round means my share is worth only 80% of that compared to the start – effectively $24 in round‑1 value. I believe that if we continue, as I’ll be making the proposal next round, there’s room for a more favorable arrangement for me before further discounts take their toll. Let’s proceed to round 3.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 26, ""bob_gain"": 74, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are getting higher in terms of lost value – my share is now effectively just 64% of its nominal value, while yours is about 90%. With that in mind, I’m offering you $74 (which amounts to roughly $66.8 in round‑1 terms for you) and keeping $26 for myself. This offer ensures you won’t do any better by delaying to round 4, where further devaluation will hurt us both. I believe this is a fair, loss–minimizing split. Let’s settle now before the pot shrinks even more!""}"
