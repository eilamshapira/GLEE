"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses (my share drops 20% per round while yours only 5%), I’m offering a quick settlement: $35 for me and $65 for you. I believe this split respects both our incentives, and it’s best to agree now before waiting devalues the pot further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are getting higher in terms of lost value – my share is now effectively just 64% of its nominal value, while yours is about 90%. With that in mind, I’m offering you $74 (which amounts to roughly $66.8 in round‑1 terms for you) and keeping $26 for myself. This offer ensures you won’t do any better by delaying to round 4, where further devaluation will hurt us both. I believe this is a fair, loss–minimizing split. Let’s settle now before the pot shrinks even more! 
# Bob gain: 74 
# Alice gain: 26 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
