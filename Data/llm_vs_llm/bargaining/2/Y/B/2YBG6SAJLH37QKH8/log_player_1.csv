"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Round 1

I'll make a fair offer that considers the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60/40 split in this first round. I'm offering you a solid portion, Bob, but I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to later rounds. This is a fair deal that gives us both substantial value right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a more balanced split now. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this 55/45 division helps account for that while still giving you a substantial portion, Bob. This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away with good value rather than continuing to lose money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm adjusting my offer to find a middle ground. With the inflation penalty now at nearly 50% for me, I need to secure enough to make this worthwhile. This 52/48 split is very reasonable and gives you a substantial portion, Bob. Let's settle this now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
