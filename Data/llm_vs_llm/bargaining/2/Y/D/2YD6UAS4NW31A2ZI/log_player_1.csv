"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800. 

Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money for me is now $10,000 * (0.95)^2 = $9025.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, the $4200 offered to me is actually worth $4200 * (1 - 0.1426) = $3610.74.

Considering this, I still don't think the offer is fair, as I'm being offered less than 45% of the original amount, and its value is further decreased by inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money for me is now $10,000 * (0.95)^4 = $8145.95, and for Bob, it's $10,000 * (0.8)^4 = $4096.

I'll make a new offer, trying to be more generous while still considering the inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
