4500.0,5500.0,"I propose a fairer split that's much better for both of us. While this gives me slightly more, it's much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm upping the offer to 4000 for you. It's still a good deal for me, considering I'm the one making the offer, and we're already seeing inflation eat away at the value.  Take it before I change my mind and the offer gets worse for you!",Alice,3,
