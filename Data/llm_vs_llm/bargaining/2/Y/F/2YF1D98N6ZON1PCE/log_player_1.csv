Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fairer split that's much better for both of us. While this gives me slightly more, it's much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
