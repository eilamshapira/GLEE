"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly! I'm offering you a quick $1000 to save us both the hassle.  Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer gives me only 10% of the total amount ($1000), which is quite low
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. Still, even with 5% inflation, I could propose a much better split next round and still come out ahead

The offer is too low to accept. I'll take my chances with making a counter-offer next round, even with the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the 5% inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a fairer split that's much better for both of us. While this gives me slightly more, it's much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a much more balanced split (55-45)
2. It gives Alice a substantial amount ($4500)
3. It acknowledges the time pressure due to inflation
4. It's reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further rounds and inflation losses"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm upping the offer to 4000 for you. It's still a good deal for me, considering I'm the one making the offer, and we're already seeing inflation eat away at the value.  Take it before I change my mind and the offer gets worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $4000 (40% of the total)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation, this $4000 is actually worth about $3610 to me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The inflation will be even higher (around 15%)
   - Alice might reject again, further reducing the value for me
4. This is a significant improvement from her initial $1000 offer
5. Alice seems aware of her advantage (no inflation effect on her side)

Given the mounting inflation pressure and the reasonable improvement in the offer, I should accept this. Further negotiations might result in worse outcomes due to the increasing inflation effect on my side.
