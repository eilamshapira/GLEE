"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 and she gets $60. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be 20% less to me.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth less to me (only $80 in effective value). Alice has no inflation penalty, so she has less incentive to settle early.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued devaluation to me is significant. $40 now is better than potentially getting less in real value later due to inflation.
