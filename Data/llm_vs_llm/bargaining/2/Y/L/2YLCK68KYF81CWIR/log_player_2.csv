"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

This is a fair 50-50 split of the money, which might seem reasonable at first glance. However, since I'm the first one to respond, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer. The only risk is the 10% inflation penalty for the next round.

In round 2, the total amount would be worth $900,000. Even with this reduction, I could propose a split that would give me more than $500,000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I should propose a split that's better for me but still reasonable enough for Alice to accept, considering the inflation penalty for further negotiations. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as it's not too greedy but gives me a better outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This split gives me an extra $100,000 compared to Alice's initial offer, while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. If she rejects this, we'll both face a 10% penalty in the next round, which would make both of us worse off than accepting this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer...

With 19% inflation, if I accept this offer, my actual value would be:
$550,000 * 0.81 = $445,500

This is less than what I would have gotten by accepting the initial 50-50 split ($500,000), and significantly less than my proposed $600,000. However, if I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (29%), and we're already in round 3 of 12.

Alice has moved from her initial 50-50 split to a more favorable offer for me (55-45), showing she's willing to negotiate. But given the inflation, this offer is actually worse in real terms.

I'll take one more chance at negotiating a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 4 and the next round will have 39% inflation, I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice is likely to accept. She's shown willingness to move from 50-50 to 55-45 in my favor, so I'll propose a slightly better split for me while still being fair enough that she should accept to avoid further inflation penalties.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

This 58-42 split is a middle ground between my previous 60-40 offer (which she rejected) and her 55-45 offer. With increasing inflation, it would be in both our interests to reach an agreement soon, and this offer gives both of us more real value than we'd get after another round of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 560000 
# Alice gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer...

With 34.39% inflation, if I accept this offer now:
$560,000 * (1 - 0.3439) = $367,416 real value

We're now in round 5 of 12, and the inflation is getting quite severe. While Alice has increased her offer to me slightly (from 550k to 560k), the inflation has eaten away much of the value. 

If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (about 44%), making any potential gains even smaller. We're also approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds, increasing the risk of running out of time.

Given these factors, and seeing that we're not making significant progress in negotiations while inflation severely erodes our potential gains, I should accept this offer.
