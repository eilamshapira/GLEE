"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that inflation doesn't affect me, this is a fair compromise considering your potential losses in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept, I get $450,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $360,000 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less due to compounding inflation
* Even if I managed to get $600,000 in round 3, it would only be worth $360,000 to me after 40% inflation
* Bob is in a stronger position since inflation doesn't affect him
