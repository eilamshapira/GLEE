"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, factoring in the 10% inflation per round that affects my earnings.

Alice is offering me $400,000 now. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I proposed a more favorable split, my money would be worth 10% less. Also, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and my money loses 10% value each round, accepting a reasonable offer early is strategically sound. While I could try for more, the $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of getting less through continued negotiation is significant.
