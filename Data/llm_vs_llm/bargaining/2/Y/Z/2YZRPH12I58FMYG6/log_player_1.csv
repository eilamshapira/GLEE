"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I need to consider that when making my decision.

To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation).

Actual value I'd get: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 2, the value was 0.95, and now in Round 3, it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

I'll offer Bob a bit less than I would have in the previous round, considering the inflation.

  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation eats away more value!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting me more. I need to compensate for that. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll multiply the offered amount by (1 - 0.1426) = 0.8574, which is the cumulative effect of 5% inflation over 3 rounds (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95).

Actual value I'd get: 46 * 0.8574 = 39.44

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal, but I also need to be aware that the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in Round 4, and now in Round 5, it's 0.8574 * 0.95 = 0.8145 (or approximately 18.55% less than in the first round), I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation.

I'll offer Bob a bit less than I would have in the previous round, considering the inflation.
