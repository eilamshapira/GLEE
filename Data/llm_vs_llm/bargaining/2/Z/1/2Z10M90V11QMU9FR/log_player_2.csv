"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about we split it 60-40? I think it's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer to split the money 60-40, giving me $40 and her $60.

While I could accept this offer now, I think we can reach a more equitable division. Since we have quite a few rounds remaining, I'll propose a more balanced split in the next round.
