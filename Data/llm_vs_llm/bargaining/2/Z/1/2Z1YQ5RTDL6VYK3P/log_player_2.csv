"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation on any amount I eventually receive. That means if I were to get $40 in the next round, it would only be worth $36 to me because of inflation.

Given that I'd need to propose a significantly better deal for myself in the next round to overcome the inflation penalty, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept it, this offer is reasonable.
