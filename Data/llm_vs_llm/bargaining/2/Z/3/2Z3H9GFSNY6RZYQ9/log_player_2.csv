"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an equal split of $500,000 each, which is fair on the surface.

Since I'm not affected by inflation (it's 0% for me), there's no particular advantage in waiting for future rounds. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which is an interesting factor.

If inflation negatively affects Alice in later rounds, she might become more willing to give me a better deal as the game progresses. On the other hand, if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that this is a fair offer already and there's the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement eventually, I'll accept this proposal.
