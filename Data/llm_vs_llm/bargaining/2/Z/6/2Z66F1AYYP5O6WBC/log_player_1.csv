Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":60,""bob_gain"":40,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your initial fair spirit. Since I'm now the proposer and considering that further rounds may expose us to inflation risks (for you, in particular), I propose a slightly revised split: $55 for me and $45 for you. Let's settle now and secure our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
