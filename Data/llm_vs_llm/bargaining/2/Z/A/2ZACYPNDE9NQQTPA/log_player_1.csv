"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 80% of $450,000, which is $360,000 (since the money I gain is worth 20% less). 

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better split in the next round or subsequent rounds, aiming to get closer to a fair share or at least ensure that the difference in inflation rates works in my favor in terms of negotiation leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and we're now in Round 3, my effective gain would be 64% of the proposed amount (80% after Round 1 * 80% after Round 2).

To make a competitive offer while considering the inflation, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing value of my share but still tries to be reasonable for Bob, considering his share devalues at a much slower rate (5% per round). 

My offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This offer slightly favors me but is still closer to a 50/50 split than Bob's previous offer, hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 51.2% of $430,000 (since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round), which is approximately $220,160.

Considering this significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because, with each passing round, the value of my potential gain decreases substantially due to the high inflation rate affecting my share. Accepting this offer, although it favors Bob, ensures I receive some value rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds, which could result in an even less favorable outcome."
