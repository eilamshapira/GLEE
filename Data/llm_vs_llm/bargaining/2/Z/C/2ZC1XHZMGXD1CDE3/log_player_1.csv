"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  It's a fairer distribution considering the risk of inflation going forward. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (at 95% value = $522,500 effective value for Bob)

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * But Bob will face even more inflation
   * However, Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds

Given that:
- The offer gives me a substantial amount ($450,000)
- The inflation is only affecting Bob, not me
- Continuing the game might make Bob more desperate but also risks both of us getting less value
- This is a reasonable offer (45% for me)
