"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind I want to secure a good outcome for myself while also making it reasonable enough for Bob to accept:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money is worth 10% less now, and Bob's offering me $45. Let's see what that's worth compared to what I could potentially gain by rejecting and making an offer in round 3. If I reject, the total amount available will effectively be $81 (90% of $90, which is the initial $100 reduced by 10% for round 2).

Given Bob's aggressive offer and the rapid deflation, I'll accept this to secure at least some guaranteed value.
