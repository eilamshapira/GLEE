Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 344828, ""bob_gain"": 655172, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement. Given that money's value drops faster for me (10% per round) than for you (5% per round), I propose that I receive $344,828 and you receive $655,172. This reflects our patience differences in a fair, subgame perfect equilibrium. Letâ€™s settle now and avoid further value loss!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe my offer is more fair given the different rates of value loss. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 317461 
# Bob gain: 682539 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
