"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement. Given that money's value drops faster for me (10% per round) than for you (5% per round), I propose that I receive $344828 and you receive $655172. This reflects our patience differences in a fair, subgame perfect equilibrium. Letâ€™s settle now and avoid further value loss! 
# Bob gain: 655172 
# Alice gain: 344828
