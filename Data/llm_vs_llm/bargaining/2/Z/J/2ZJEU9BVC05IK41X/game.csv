600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money so I get $600000 and you get $400000. This way, we both secure a good amount right from the start before inflation impacts us. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think we should split the money more evenly. I propose 55% for me and 45% for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's more fair in my opinion.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on our decisions. I'll adjust my proposal to $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This splits the difference from your last offer and gets us both a fair amount before inflation continues to erode our gains further. I hope you agree!",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I need to adjust my proposal to secure a larger share. I propose 58% for me and 42% for you. This is my attempt to mitigate the effects of inflation, and I hope you understand my position.",Bob,4,

510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand that inflation has been impacting both of us differently. My offer now is for me to take $510000 and you $490000. This allows you to secure more than your previous proposal considering inflation impact and is close to an equal split, which is reasonable given the circumstances. I look forward to reaching an agreement.",Alice,5,
