"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take $600000 for myself and give you $400000. This seems like a fair split considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider that my money will decrease by 10% each round if I reject. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me, so I'd need to secure more than $444,444 ($400,000 รท 0.9) to come out ahead.

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable initial offer, I'll accept this proposal.
