Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hitting me hard! Let's split it 55/45 to account for that. It's a fair deal for both of us, especially considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
