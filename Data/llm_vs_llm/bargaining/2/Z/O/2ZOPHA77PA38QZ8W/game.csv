8000.0,2000.0,I think this division is fair since I will take a bigger share and you're still getting some amount. Let's agree on this!,Alice,1,

9999.0,1.0,"Alice, I understand that if you reject this offer, you’ll be in the strong position of proposing next round and can claim almost the entire $10000. To avoid further delay (and the additional 20% depreciation on my share), I’m offering you nearly the full amount right now. I’m leaving myself only a token share because I value our agreement over the risk of ending with nothing. I hope you find this offer acceptable.",Bob,2,
