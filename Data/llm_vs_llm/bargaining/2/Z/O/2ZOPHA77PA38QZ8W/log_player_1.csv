"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""I think this division is fair since I will take a bigger share and you're still getting some amount. Let's agree on this!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that if you reject this offer, you’ll be in the strong position of proposing next round and can claim almost the entire $10000. To avoid further delay (and the additional 20% depreciation on my share), I’m offering you nearly the full amount right now. I’m leaving myself only a token share because I value our agreement over the risk of ending with nothing. I hope you find this offer acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 9999 
# Bob gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
