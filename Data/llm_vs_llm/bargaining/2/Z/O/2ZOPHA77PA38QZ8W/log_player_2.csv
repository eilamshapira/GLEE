"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this division is fair since I will take a bigger share and you're still getting some amount. Let's agree on this! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1, ""alice_gain"": 9999, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand that if you reject this offer, you’ll be in the strong position of proposing next round and can claim almost the entire $10,000. To avoid further delay (and the additional 20% depreciation on my share), I’m offering you nearly the full amount right now. I’m leaving myself only a token share because I value our agreement over the risk of ending with nothing. I hope you find this offer acceptable.""}"
