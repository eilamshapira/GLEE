60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since we couldn't agree on your terms, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Let's find a middle ground and settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation impact on my side, I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. A 65-35 split would actually be worth about 52 for me after inflation, which is more reasonable. Please consider this offer carefully as further delays will hurt us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, considering the inflation affecting you and the need to reach an agreement soon, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable given the circumstances, and it ensures we both walk away with something before the situation deteriorates further. Let's end this now on equal terms.",Bob,4,
