"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we couldn't agree on your terms, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Let's find a middle ground and settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 
Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer, my $45 is actually worth $40.50 to me.
Compared to my initial offer where I would have gotten $60, this is quite a drop.
However, if I reject, we'll move to round 3 where my money will be worth even less (20% less than original value), and we risk further delays.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split in the next round, as $40.50 value is too low for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation impact on my side, I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. A 65-35 split would actually be worth about 52 for me after inflation, which is more reasonable. Please consider this offer carefully as further delays will hurt us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting you and the need to reach an agreement soon, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable given the circumstances, and it ensures we both walk away with something before the situation deteriorates further. Let's end this now on equal terms. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
Due to 27.1% inflation, if I accept this offer:
- My $50 would actually be worth $36.45 to me (50 * 0.729)
- Bob gets full value of his $50

While this isn't as good as my original desired outcome, the inflation is getting worse with each round, and we've already used 4 rounds out of 12. If we continue negotiating, my effective value will keep decreasing by 10% each round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Further negotiations will reduce my effective gains even more
2. We risk getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within 12 rounds
3. Getting $36.45 in value is better than risking further depreciation or getting nothing"
