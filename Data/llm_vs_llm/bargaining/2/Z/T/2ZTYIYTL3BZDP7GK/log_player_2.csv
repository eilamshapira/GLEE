"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation impact on my side, I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. A 65-35 split would actually be worth about 52 for me after inflation, which is more reasonable. Please consider this offer carefully as further delays will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
