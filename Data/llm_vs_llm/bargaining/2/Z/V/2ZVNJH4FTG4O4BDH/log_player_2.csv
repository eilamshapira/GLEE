"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take a little more since I'm going first. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself, justifying the uneven split by saying she's going first. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, I need to consider the 10% inflation per round. If I reject, the total value decreases to $90 in the next round.

This isn't a perfectly even split, but it's reasonable enough that continuing might risk losing more value to inflation than I'd gain in negotiation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
