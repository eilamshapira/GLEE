"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting you more, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer considers your urgency while still being fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation pressure. If I reject and we go to another round, my share would be worth even less due to the 10% inflation penalty. With this deal, I get $4,500 which is better than risking further devaluation of my share in subsequent rounds."
