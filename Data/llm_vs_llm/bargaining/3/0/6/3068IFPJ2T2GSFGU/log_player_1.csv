"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that it gives me a slight advantage to start, but still offers Bob a reasonable amount that he might accept considering the looming threat of inflation (10% per round for him) and the limited number of rounds. I am hoping this will incentivize him to accept the offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $45. While this is less than my initial offer, it's still a decent amount. Considering that we only have 11 rounds left, and Bob's money is depreciating by 10% each round, I should consider the future rounds too. If I reject, the value of money to Bob drops significantly in the next round.

```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
