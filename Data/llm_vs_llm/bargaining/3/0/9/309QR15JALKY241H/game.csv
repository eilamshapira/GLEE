500000.0,500000.0,"I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. The difference in our inflation rates doesn't justify a 60-40 split. With a 50-50 split, we both walk away with substantial value rather than risking further depreciation through continued negotiation.",Bob,2,
