"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. The difference in our inflation rates doesn't justify a 60-40 split. With a 50-50 split, we both walk away with substantial value rather than risking further depreciation through continued negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
