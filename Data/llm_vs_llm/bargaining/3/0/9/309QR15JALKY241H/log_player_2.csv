"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor to account for my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Given the information:
- Alice's inflation rate is 20% per round
- My inflation rate is 5% per round
- Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000

While Alice does have a higher inflation rate, I'm not convinced this split accurately accounts for the difference in our inflation rates. If we wait one round, I can make a counter-offer, and my money would only be worth 5% less. Let me reject this offer and propose something in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for our inflation rates while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. The difference in our inflation rates doesn't justify a 60-40 split. With a 50-50 split, we both walk away with substantial value rather than risking further depreciation through continued negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your point, but considering my higher inflation rate, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's updated offer.

Given the information:
- We're now in round 3
- My money has depreciated by 9.75% from the original value
- Alice's money has depreciated by 36% from the original value
- Alice is offering me $450,000 and taking $550,000

Alice has moved from 60-40 to 55-45, which is a reasonable compromise. Given the significant difference in our inflation rates (my 5% vs her 20% per round), and the fact that she's already lost 36% of her value while I've only lost 9.75%, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate and losing more value.
