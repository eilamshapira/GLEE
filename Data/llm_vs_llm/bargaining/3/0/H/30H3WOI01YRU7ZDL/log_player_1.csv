"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both parties a substantial amount, but with a slight advantage for me as the first mover:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of an equal 50-50 split. This is a fair division that benefits both parties equally, and there's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me."
