"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair division considering the different inflation rates we're facing. Since Bob's money loses value more quickly (20% per round vs. my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal. Given that we're now in the third round and the money is worth less to both of us (especially to Bob with his 20% inflation rate), this should be a reasonable compromise that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose that I receive $52 and Bob receives $48. I've further adjusted my offer to give Bob a larger share. Since we're now in the fifth round, inflation is significantly affecting both of us - my money is worth about 19% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth about 59% less. This offer is reasonable given our inflation rates and the urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
