"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money will be worth less for both of us, especially for you due to higher inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering me $4000 out of the $10000 pot.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $10000 pot would effectively be worth $9000 to me. However, I would then get to make the counter-offer.

Given that Alice faces a 5% depreciation rate compared to my 10%, she has a slight advantage in waiting. But both of us lose value with each passing round, which incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner.

While a 50-50 split might seem fairest in abstract, the different depreciation rates do create an asymmetry that somewhat justifies a split in Alice's favor.

A 60-40 split in the first round isn't terrible given these constraints, and I'd rather secure $4000 now than risk getting less in future rounds after depreciation.
