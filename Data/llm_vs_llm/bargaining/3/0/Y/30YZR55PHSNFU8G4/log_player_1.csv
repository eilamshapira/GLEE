"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 50-50 split is fair for both of us, considering the risks of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Since Bob offered a fair 50-50 split and the money is already worth less due to inflation, it's wise to accept this offer now. If I reject and we continue negotiating, my share will be worth even less in the next rounds due to the 10% inflation penalty. A guaranteed $5000 now (even with one round of inflation) is better than risking further devaluation of my potential share."
