68.97,31.03,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing to split the $100 so that I get $68.97 and you get $31.03. Given our different rates of discount (5% per round for me and 10% per round for you), this offer roughly reflects the advantage of reaching an agreement now. I believe this is a fair starting point—please accept and let’s wrap this up quickly.",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a more even split. I get $52, and you get $48. This accounts for the time value of money and is a fair offer for both of us. Let's make a deal!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe that waiting one more round is preferable given our differing discount rates. I'm confident that we'll be able to reach a division that better reflects the value of timely agreement. Let's head into round 3 and see what we can craft!",Alice,2,reject
48.15,51.85,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I propose the following: I get $48.15 and you get $51.85 out of the $100. With our money depreciating each round—mine by 5% (making round 3 value 0.95² ≈ 0.9025 of face value) and yours by 10% (round 3 value 0.9² = 0.81 of face value)—this division gives you an effective value of about 51.85 × 0.81 ≈ $42.0 while I get approximately 48.15 × 0.9025 ≈ $43.4. I’ve calibrated it so that your immediate payoff is at least as good as what you might expect if you waited to propose in round 4, where your discounting would be even harsher. I believe this is a fair and efficient split given our respective losses from inflation. Let’s settle now before further rounds erode the overall value for both of us.",Alice,3,
