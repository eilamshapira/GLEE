4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $4500 while you receive $5500. By concluding our agreement now, we both avoid the delays and potential losses â€“ especially for me, since the money loses 10% in value each round. I believe this fair split gives you a slight edge, and I hope it convinces you to settle immediately. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think it's fair that I get a bit more since the money is losing value for me faster. I propose I get $5200 and you get $4800. This way, we both get a fair amount, and we can avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
