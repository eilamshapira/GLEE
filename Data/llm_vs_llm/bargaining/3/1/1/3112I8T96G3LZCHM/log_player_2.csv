"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $4500 while you receive $5500. By concluding our agreement now, we both avoid the delays and potential losses â€“ especially for me, since the money loses 10% in value each round. I believe this fair split gives you a slight edge, and I hope it convinces you to settle immediately. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think it's fair that I get a bit more since the money is losing value for me faster. I propose I get $5200 and you get $4800. This way, we both get a fair amount, and we can avoid further devaluation.""}"
