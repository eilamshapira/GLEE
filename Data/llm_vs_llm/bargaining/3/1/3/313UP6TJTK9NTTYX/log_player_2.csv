"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which isn't a fair division. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. While the money will be worth 20% less (so $8,000 total value), I could propose a much more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the 20% inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $5,000, which is fair to both of us. With the 20% decrease in value, we're effectively dividing $8,000 worth of purchasing power, so we'd each get $4,000 in original value terms. This is much more equitable than the previous offer where I would have received only $1,000."
