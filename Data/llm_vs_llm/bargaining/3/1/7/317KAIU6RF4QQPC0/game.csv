450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering we both want to avoid inflation losses, I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but with a slightly higher share for myself. Let's settle on $550000 for me and $450000 for you.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Although your offer gives me $450000, which is a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, the inflation penalty means that waiting further will only diminish my share further. So I'd prefer to lock in the deal now to avoid further losses. I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
