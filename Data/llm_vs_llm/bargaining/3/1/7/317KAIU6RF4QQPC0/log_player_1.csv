"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $600,000 and you get $400,000. Accepting this offer now helps us avoid any inflation losses on my side. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering we both want to avoid inflation losses, I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but with a slightly higher share for myself. Let's settle on $550000 for me and $450000 for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Although your offer gives me $450,000, which is a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, the inflation penalty means that waiting further will only diminish my share further. So I'd prefer to lock in the deal now to avoid further losses. I accept your offer.""}"
