600000.0,400000.0,"I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given that I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. If we go to the next round, the total value to me drops significantly, so I'm incentivized to make a reasonable first offer. This gives you a substantial $400000 without any risk of devaluation.",Alice,1,
