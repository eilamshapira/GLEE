"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given that I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. If we go to the next round, the total value to me drops significantly, so I'm incentivized to make a reasonable first offer. This gives you a substantial $400000 without any risk of devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer gives us both a healthy share of the money, and it's a more equitable split than your initial proposal.""}
