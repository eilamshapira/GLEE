"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this quickly to minimize the effects of inflation. This is a fair split considering the risk of losing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. In round 2, $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, I'd need to get more than $5,000 to beat the current $4,000 offer
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

While 40% isn't ideal, considering the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
