"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game and the rules, including the inflation factor for both of us.

Let's analyze Alice's offer in Round 1:

*   **Alice's offer:** I (Bob) get $400,000, and Alice gets $600,000.

I need to consider whether $400,000 is enough, knowing that the money depreciates by 20% each round. If I reject, I'll have to make an offer in the next round, but the total amount remaining will be worth less to me.

Here's my thought process:

Is $400,000 *now* better than what I could *potentially* get *later*, accounting for inflation? It's difficult to be certain without knowing Alice's strategy.

Because the depreciation rate is much higher for me, I am going to accept the offer.
