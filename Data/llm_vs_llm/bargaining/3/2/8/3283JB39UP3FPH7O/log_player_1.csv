"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money will be worth less for both of us, and you'll lose value faster than me. Let's make a deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's go for an even 50-50 split. It's fair for both of us, and we avoid the impact of any further devaluation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I know the money is devaluing faster for Bob than for me. I can make a better counteroffer in the next round that accounts for this difference in inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic here. With your 10% inflation rate versus my 5%, waiting is worse for you. This 55-45 split is actually more favorable to you than what you'll get if we keep negotiating. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, how about we meet closer to halfway with a 47-53 split? This way, we both lose less money to inflation compared to ongoing negotiations. Let's settle this now! 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly better split, the increasing inflation rates mean that continuing to negotiate would reduce the real value of my gains. A 5300$ share now (at 14.26% inflation) is better than risking further rounds where both the negotiation could go either way and the money would be worth even less."
