"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money will be worth less for both of us, and you'll lose value faster than me. Let's make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic here. With your 10% inflation rate versus my 5%, waiting is worse for you. This 55-45 split is actually more favorable to you than what you'll get if we keep negotiating. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
