"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I get a bit more for proposing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500. She's suggesting she deserves more for making the first offer.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will decrease by 5% to $9,500. That means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, we'd each get $4,750, which is only $250 more than what I'm being offered now. And that's assuming Alice would accept that offer.

While the split isn't 50-50, the difference isn't large enough to risk rejection and inflation.
