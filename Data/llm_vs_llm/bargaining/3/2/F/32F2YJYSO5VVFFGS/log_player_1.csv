"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I have the first-mover advantage but still want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than wait for the next round where the total value will be less for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept this 50-50 split now, my $50 is worth $47.50 due to 5% inflation
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than the original value
* Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, Bob might reject again, leading to further depreciation of my share

Given this analysis, I should accept this fair split now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds due to compounding inflation.
