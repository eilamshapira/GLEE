"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer splits $1M into:
   * $400,000 for me (Bob)
   * $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 20% less to me
   * And only 10% less to Alice
   * This means in the next round, my maximum value would be $800,000 ($1M Ã— 0.8)

3. Decision:
   * $400,000 now is better than a potential for slightly more later
   * The inflation penalty is significant
   * There's risk in rejection as Alice might reject my counter-offer
   * 40% is a reasonable share given I'm facing higher inflation
