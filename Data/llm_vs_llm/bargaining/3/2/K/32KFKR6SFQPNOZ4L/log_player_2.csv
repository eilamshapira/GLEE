"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the $10000 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering an even split of $5000 each. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty that affects only me if we go to another round.

If I reject and we go to round 2, any money I get will be worth 10% less to me. This means I would need to secure more than $5555.56 in the next round to be better off than accepting $5000 now (since $5555.56 Ã— 0.9 = $5000).

Given this inflation penalty that only affects me, a 50-50 split now is actually quite reasonable.
