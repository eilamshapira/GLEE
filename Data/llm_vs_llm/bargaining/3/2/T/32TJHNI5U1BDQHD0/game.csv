60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since your money loses 10% value each round, it's better to accept now rather than delay.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and I don't have to worry about inflation. It's a win-win situation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, consider this carefully: Due to your 20% inflation so far, if you reject this, your next 50-50 offer would actually be worth less than this 35 to you. Let's conclude this now - it's in both our best interests.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your strategy, but I think you're being too aggressive. I'm willing to take a slight hit to reach an agreement. Let's settle for this and avoid further inflation on my side.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to 30% inflation on your side, this 30 is quickly becoming worth even less to you. My offer is actually better than another round of negotiation where your share would lose more value. It's time to reach an agreement.",Alice,5,
