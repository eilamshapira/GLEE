"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since your money loses 10% value each round, it's better to accept now rather than delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and I don't have to worry about inflation. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 50-50 split isn't optimal given the inflation dynamics. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round while I don't, I have more bargaining power. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, consider this carefully: Due to your 20% inflation so far, if you reject this, your next 50-50 offer would actually be worth less than this 35 to you. Let's conclude this now - it's in both our best interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your strategy, but I think you're being too aggressive. I'm willing to take a slight hit to reach an agreement. Let's settle for this and avoid further inflation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With Bob facing 27.1% inflation while I have no inflation, a 45-55 split is not advantageous for me. His 55 is already worth significantly less to him, and my bargaining position continues to strengthen with each round. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to 30% inflation on your side, this 30 is quickly becoming worth even less to you. My offer is actually better than another round of negotiation where your share would lose more value. It's time to reach an agreement.""}"
