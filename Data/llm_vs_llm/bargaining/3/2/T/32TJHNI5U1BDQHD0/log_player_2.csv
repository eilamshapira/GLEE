Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this carefully: Due to your 20% inflation so far, if you reject this, your next 50-50 offer would actually be worth less than this 35 to you. Let's conclude this now - it's in both our best interests.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to 30% inflation on your side, this 30 is quickly becoming worth even less to you. My offer is actually better than another round of negotiation where your share would lose more value. It's time to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70
