"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be reasonable and likely to be accepted:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 51,
""bob_gain"": 49
}
```
Explanation:
I am asking for slightly more than Bob because I am making the initial offer. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's attitude towards the negotiation. This offer still gives Bob a good portion of the money and it is most likely that the offer will be accepted."
