"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning is that offering Bob a significant portion of the money upfront increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer and avoids the risk of losing everything in later rounds. I am asking for a slight majority, which I hope he will find reasonable to end the negotiation quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, clearly Bob is playing aggressively. I need to be more strategic. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm increasing my ask slightly, but still offering a substantial amount. I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing a decent outcome for myself. The clock is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Bob is being completely unreasonable. I need to make a more conciliatory offer before we run out of time.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

I am barely taking more than half. I hope Bob sees this as a sign of good faith and accepts it. We're almost halfway through the rounds."
