"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. In round 1, the money still has full value for me. Alice is offering an even 50-50 split, which gives me $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be dealing with 20% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $80.

While I could potentially get more than $50 in the next round, there's risk involved if Alice rejects my counter-offer. A 50-50 split is fair, and securing $50 now without inflation is reasonable.
