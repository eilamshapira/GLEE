"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $100, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first proposer. If we move to the next round, inflation will reduce our total value, so it's in both our interests to agree early. This gives you $45 which is better than risking further negotiations with inflation.""}"
