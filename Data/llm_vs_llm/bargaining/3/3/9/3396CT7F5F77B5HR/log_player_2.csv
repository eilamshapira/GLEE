"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first proposer. If we move to the next round, inflation will reduce our total value, so it's in both our interests to agree early. This gives you $45 which is better than risking further negotiations with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
