285680.0,714320.0,"Alice, considering that if you wait until the next round you’d get to propose—but your money loses 20% value per round while mine only 10%—I’ve calculated an offer that gives you exactly what you’d expect to secure in round 3. Accepting now means you get $285680 (worth 0.8× that immediately) versus the effective amount you'd get later. I believe this is a fair split given the time discounting. Please accept.",Bob,2,
