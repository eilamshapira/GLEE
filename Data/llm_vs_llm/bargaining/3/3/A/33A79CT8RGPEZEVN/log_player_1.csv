"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that if you wait until the next round you’d get to propose—but your money loses 20% value per round while mine only 10%—I’ve calculated an offer that gives you exactly what you’d expect to secure in round 3. Accepting now means you get $285680 (worth 0.8× that immediately) versus the effective amount you'd get later. I believe this is a fair split given the time discounting. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 285680 
# Bob gain: 714320 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
