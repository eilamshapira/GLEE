"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714320, ""alice_gain"": 285680, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that if you wait until the next round you’d get to propose—but your money loses 20% value per round while mine only 10%—I’ve calculated an offer that gives you exactly what you’d expect to secure in round 3. Accepting now means you get $285,680 (worth 0.8× that immediately) versus the effective amount you'd get later. I believe this is a fair split given the time discounting. Please accept.""}"
