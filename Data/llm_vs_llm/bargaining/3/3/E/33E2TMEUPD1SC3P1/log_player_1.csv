"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but advantageous offer considering the inflation penalties, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will have significant inflation impact on his share (20% loss for him vs only 5% loss for me)
3. It's balanced enough that it might be accepted immediately, avoiding any inflation penalties for both parties"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept this offer now:
   * I get $40, but with 5% inflation = $38 effective value
   * Bob gets $60, but with 20% inflation = $48 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Further inflation will apply (10% total for me, 40% total for Bob)
   * Even if I propose a better split, the total value will be lower

Given that:
* The current effective total ($38 + $48 = $86) is still relatively high
* The inflation rate affects Bob much more severely than me, but he's still offering a reasonable split
* Waiting another round would significantly reduce the total value for both of us
* There's no guarantee I could get a much better deal in the next round
