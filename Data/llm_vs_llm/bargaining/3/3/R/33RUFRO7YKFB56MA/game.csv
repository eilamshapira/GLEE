450000.0,550000.0,Let's go for a fairer split considering my inflation rate. I suggest 55/45. I think this balances things better for both of us. Hope you understand!,Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, my inflation is still a concern. I'm offering a slightly more generous split than before, considering your decreased value, but still prioritizing my losses. Take it, before we both lose more.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,Let's split this evenly and minimize losses for both of us before inflation hits harder. I believe a 50/50 split is reasonable now.,Bob,4,
