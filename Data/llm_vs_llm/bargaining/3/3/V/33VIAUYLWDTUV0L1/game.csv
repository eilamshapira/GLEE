1687.65,8312.35,"Hi Bob, to avoid future losses from devaluation, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $8312.35 and I’d get $1687.65. I believe this is fair given that delaying costs me 20% per round while you lose only 5% per round. Let’s agree now so we both secure as much value as possible.",Alice,1,

1666.67,8333.33,"Alice, I propose we settle now: I receive $8333.33 and you get $1666.67. If you wait until round 3 to propose your deal, the rapid 20% per round devaluation will lower your effective value to about $1666.67. To avoid further losses for both of us, let's agree to this division immediately.",Bob,2,
