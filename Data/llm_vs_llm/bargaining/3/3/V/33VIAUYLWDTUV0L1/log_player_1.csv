"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1687.65, ""bob_gain"": 8312.35, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid future losses from devaluation, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $8,312.35 and I’d get $1,687.65. I believe this is fair given that delaying costs me 20% per round while you lose only 5% per round. Let’s agree now so we both secure as much value as possible.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we settle now: I receive $8333.33 and you get $1666.67. If you wait until round 3 to propose your deal, the rapid 20% per round devaluation will lower your effective value to about $1666.67. To avoid further losses for both of us, let's agree to this division immediately. 
# Alice gain: 1666.67 
# Bob gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
