"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid future losses from devaluation, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $8312.35 and I’d get $1687.65. I believe this is fair given that delaying costs me 20% per round while you lose only 5% per round. Let’s agree now so we both secure as much value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 8312.35 
# Alice gain: 1687.65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8333.33, ""alice_gain"": 1666.67, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we settle now: I receive $8,333.33 and you get $1,666.67. If you wait until round 3 to propose your deal, the rapid 20% per round devaluation will lower your effective value to about $1,666.67. To avoid further losses for both of us, let's agree to this division immediately.""}"
