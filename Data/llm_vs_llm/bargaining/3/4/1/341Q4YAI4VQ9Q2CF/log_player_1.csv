"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Let me think about a fair offer considering the 20% inflation effect on my end with each passing round.

Given that there's inflation for me, I'd want to secure a decent amount in the first round, but also make it acceptable for Bob. If he rejects, I'll get less value in the next round, so I need to balance being fair with protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself but still close to an even split. This acknowledges that I face inflation in future rounds, so there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, waiting longer would reduce the value of any money I receive. The $4,500 I get now is worth more to me than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in a future round when inflation has further reduced its value. This is a reasonable compromise."
