"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the effective amount.
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400. 

Alice's offer gives me $4,200, which is approximately 65.6% of the effective amount. 

Given the circumstances, I think this is a reasonable offer.
