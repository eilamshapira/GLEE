"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has a lower inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but accounts for the fact that I lose value faster (10% vs 5% per round) if we keep negotiating. This gives both of us a good outcome without risking multiple rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's worse for me than my initial proposal, and the inflation penalty affects me more severely than Bob. I can make a new proposal in the next round that could still be better for both of us than continuing multiple rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3 and my money is worth 20% less than the initial value while Bob's is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my strategy but still aim for a reasonable split.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm increasing my requested share to compensate for the increased inflation impact, while still keeping the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept rather than risk further devaluation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. The split is getting worse for me (40/60)
2. With my higher inflation rate (10% vs 5%), I'm already losing more value
3. Even though rejecting means more inflation, I can make a counter-offer in the next round that could lead to a better outcome for both of us rather than accepting this unfavorable split"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, we're both losing significant value (I've lost about 34% and Bob has lost about 19%). We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43}

I'm softening my previous demand (down from 60/40) to show willingness to compromise, while still requesting enough to compensate for my higher inflation rate. This offer gives both of us a reasonable outcome that's better than continuing several more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. We're now 6 rounds in, and my money has lost about 41% of its value
2. Further negotiations would lead to even more value loss for both of us
3. Getting 40% of the money now is better than risking getting nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds
4. My 40% now is worth more than potentially getting a higher percentage in later rounds due to increasing inflation"
