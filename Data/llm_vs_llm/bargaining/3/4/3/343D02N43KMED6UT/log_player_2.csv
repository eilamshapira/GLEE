# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation."

While the inflation is starting to become a factor, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds. Alice's offers are slowly moving towards a more even split, suggesting she might be getting nervous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6

I'm keeping my offer the same. Let's see if the increasing inflation pressures Alice to accept a less favorable deal."
