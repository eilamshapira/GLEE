```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation.

Since the money I receive is worth 5% less due to inflation, the 4500 I would receive is effectively only worth 95% of its original value.

Therefore:

4500 * 0.95 = 4275
