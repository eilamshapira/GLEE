"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest a division where I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. I'm offering slightly more to myself because inflation will affect me in future rounds, so I'd prefer to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting a bit less than I proposed ($4,800 instead of $5,500), due to the 5% inflation, if I reject and we continue to another round, the money would be worth even less to me. Taking $4,800 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to continued inflation."
