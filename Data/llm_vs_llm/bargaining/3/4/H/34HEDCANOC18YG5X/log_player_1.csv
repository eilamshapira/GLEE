"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good share, but with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split, and accepting now would be better than waiting for the next round where the total value decreases by 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, due to the 10% inflation, waiting another round would only decrease the value further. A 50-50 split is fair, and even with the inflation, I'll get $45 worth of value (50 * 0.9), which is better than risking another round of inflation.
