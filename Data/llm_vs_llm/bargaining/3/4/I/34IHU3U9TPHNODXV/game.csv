1.0,999999.0,"Hi Bob, given that each round delays my payout by 20% while your dollar value remains unchanged, I want to avoid any procrastination. To secure a prompt agreement, I’m offering you essentially the full amount immediately – you get $999999 and I keep a token $1. I believe this is the best way to cut through delays and get the deal done quickly. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,
