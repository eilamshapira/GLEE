"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that each round delays my payout by 20% while your dollar value remains unchanged, I want to avoid any procrastination. To secure a prompt agreement, I’m offering you essentially the full amount immediately – you get $999999 and I keep a token $1. I believe this is the best way to cut through delays and get the deal done quickly. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 999999 
# Alice gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","I understand Alice's proposal, offering me $999,999 of the $1,000,000, while she keeps only $1.

While I'm not affected by inflation (my money maintains its value between rounds), Alice faces a 20% reduction in value each round. This gives me significant leverage in negotiations.

However, Alice's offer is extremely generous - I would receive 99.9999% of the total amount. Even though I could potentially make a counter-offer in the next round, there's virtually no practical benefit to rejecting such a favorable deal.
