Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your perspective. Let's try a slightly adjusted split of $400000 for me and $600000 for you. We both still get a substantial amount, and itâ€™s a win-win considering the inflation factor.

# Alice gain: 400000
