"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob in this game. Since I'm Alice and going first, I'll try to find a fair balance that recognizes both our positions.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial amount of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we're currently negotiating back and forth. Since we're now in Round 3, I need to be mindful that inflation is affecting Bob's gains by 10% each round. Let me try a slightly more balanced offer.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose I receive $520,000 and Bob receives $480,000. This is a more favorable split for Bob compared to my first offer, acknowledging that we need to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much of Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're now in Round 5, and the inflation effect on Bob's value is increasing significantly. With each round, Bob loses more potential value. Let me adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfect 50-50 split where I receive $500,000 and Bob receives $500,000. This is a fair and equal division that acknowledges the time pressure Bob faces due to inflation affecting his gains."
