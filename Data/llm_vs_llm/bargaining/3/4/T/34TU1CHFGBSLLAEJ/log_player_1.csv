"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split closer to equal, considering I also face inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that with 20% inflation on my portion, getting $45 now is better than risking further rounds where my purchasing power will continue to decrease. While this is less than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split considering the circumstances."
