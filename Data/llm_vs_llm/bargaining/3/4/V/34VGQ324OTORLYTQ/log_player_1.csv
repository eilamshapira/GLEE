"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the diminishing value of the money each round due to inflation. I want to start with a strong offer that Bob is likely to accept, but also ensures I get a good portion of the initial value.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a substantial $4,000, which should be enticing. I'm also securing $6,000 for myself, recognizing the inflation factor that will impact later rounds."
