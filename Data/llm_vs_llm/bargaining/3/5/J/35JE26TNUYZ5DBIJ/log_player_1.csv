"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still fair, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual value of $5000 for me would be $5000 * 0.95 = $4750.

For Bob, the money he gains is worth 10% less, so the $5000 he proposed for himself would actually be worth $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 to him.

Considering this, the offer seems fair as it reflects an equal split after accounting for the inflation. Since the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round, accepting this offer might be the best option to ensure I get a significant amount.
