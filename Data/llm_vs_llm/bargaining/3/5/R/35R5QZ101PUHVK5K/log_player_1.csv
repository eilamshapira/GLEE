"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I'm confident we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I wait another round, my gains will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
2. Getting $49 now is better than risking further negotiations where my position weakens with each round
3. The split is reasonably fair, and Bob's message shows willingness to compromise
4. With inflation already affecting my share, $49 in round 2 is equivalent to about $39.20 in real value, and it will only get worse if I wait"
