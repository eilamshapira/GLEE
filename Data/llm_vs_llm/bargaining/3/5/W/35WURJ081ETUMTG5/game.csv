60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), it's in your best interest to accept now rather than delay.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I understand your position, but I need a bit more to compensate for the faster inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle for a 55-45 split this round.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Due to the increasing inflation impact on your share (now 40% total loss for you vs 15% for me), you should seriously consider accepting this offer. Further delays will only decrease the real value of your share more dramatically than mine.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"I need to secure more due to my higher inflation rate. Let's settle for a 60-40 split this round, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my share.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"The inflation has already reduced your money's value by nearly 60%, while mine has only lost about 20%. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than waiting another round. It's in your best interest to accept now.",Alice,5,
