"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), it's in your best interest to accept now rather than delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I need a bit more to compensate for the faster inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle for a 55-45 split this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it gives me less than my initial proposal, and my money loses value more slowly than Bob's. In the next round, I can make a more favorable proposal for myself, and Bob will face even greater inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Due to the increasing inflation impact on your share (now 40% total loss for you vs 15% for me), you should seriously consider accepting this offer. Further delays will only decrease the real value of your share more dramatically than mine.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need to secure more due to my higher inflation rate. Let's settle for a 60-40 split this round, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it gives me less than previous proposals. With Bob's inflation rate at 20% per round, their share is losing value much faster than mine. This gives me stronger negotiating power in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, 
""bob_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""The inflation has already reduced your money's value by nearly 60%, while mine has only lost about 20%. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than waiting another round. It's in your best interest to accept now.""}"
