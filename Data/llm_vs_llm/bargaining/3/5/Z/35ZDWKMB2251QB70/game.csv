550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given the impact of inflation on our shares, I propose a split where I get 550000$ and you get 450000$. This is fair considering the risks we both face and the fact that I had to reject your initial offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I need to account for the 10% inflation loss I'm facing each round. My $600000 is actually worth $540000 to me now. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation impact, and we should agree quickly before further value is lost for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 36% less value, I propose a split of 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. This adjustment is necessary to counteract the rapid devaluation of my portion, and it's still a fair offer given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be rational here. Your money is devaluing faster than mine (48.8% vs 27.1% last round). Even with this split, your $350000 now is better than getting less value in future rounds. We should conclude this now before both our shares lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, the value of my share has decreased dramatically, now at 59.04% less than the initial value. To counteract this, I propose a split of 650000$ for me and 350000$ for you. This is a necessary adjustment to ensure I'm not left with significantly less value due to inflation. Let's agree on this before our shares lose even more value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, the math is clear: your share is devaluing at 67.23% while mine at 40.95%. Even with this split, your $300000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. We're both losing value with each round, but you're losing much more. Let's end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with my share now worth 73.79% less than at the start, I need to propose a split of 700000$ for me and 300000$ for you. This is crucial to mitigate the severe impact of inflation on my portion. We're running out of time, and this offer is fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your money is devaluing at 79.03% while mine at 52.17%. Your $250000 now is worth more than $700000 in the next rounds. We only have 3 rounds left after this - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This is your best option given the severe inflation impact on your share.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, my share is now worth 83.22% less than at the start, which is a drastic reduction. To address this, I propose a split of 750000$ for me and 250000$ for you. We're down to the last few rounds, and this offer is essential to ensure I don't walk away with almost nothing due to inflation. Let's agree on this before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your money is devaluing at 86.58% while mine at 61.26%. Even $200000 now is worth more than $750000 in the final round for you. If we don't agree now or next round, we BOTH get NOTHING. Take this offer - it's your best remaining option given the extreme inflation impact on your share.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, this is our last chance. My share is now worth 89.26% less than at the start, which is nearly valueless. I propose a split of 800000$ for me and 200000$ for you. It's critical we agree now to avoid both walking away with nothing. This is our final opportunity to salvage something from this negotiation.",Bob,12,
