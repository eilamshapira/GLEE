"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the impact of inflation on our shares, I propose a split where I get 550000$ and you get 450000$. This is fair considering the risks we both face and the fact that I had to reject your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact means my $450,000 would be worth only $405,000 (90% of original value). I can make a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 36% less value, I propose a split of 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. This adjustment is necessary to counteract the rapid devaluation of my portion, and it's still a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

My $400,000 would be worth only about $291,600 after the 27.1% inflation impact. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, as we're both losing value with each rejection but I'm losing less than Bob is."

Round 5

""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational here. Your money is devaluing faster than mine (48.8% vs 27.1% last round). Even with this split, your $350,000 now is better than getting less value in future rounds. We should conclude this now before both our shares lose more value.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of my share has decreased dramatically, now at 59.04% less than the initial value. To counteract this, I propose a split of 650000$ for me and 350000$ for you. This is a necessary adjustment to ensure I'm not left with significantly less value due to inflation. Let's agree on this before our shares lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 40.95% inflation impact, my $350,000 would only be worth about $206,675. Since Bob's money is devaluing faster than mine (67.23% vs 40.95%), I maintain negotiating leverage. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

""message"": ""Bob, the math is clear: your share is devaluing at 67.23% while mine at 40.95%. Even with this split, your $300,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. We're both losing value with each round, but you're losing much more. Let's end this now.""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with my share now worth 73.79% less than at the start, I need to propose a split of 700000$ for me and 300000$ for you. This is crucial to mitigate the severe impact of inflation on my portion. We're running out of time, and this offer is fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

My $300,000 would only be worth about $143,490 after 52.17% inflation, while Bob's share is devaluing even more severely at 79.03%. With only 4 rounds left and Bob's money losing value much faster than mine, I maintain the stronger negotiating position. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my share is now worth 83.22% less than at the start, which is a drastic reduction. To address this, I propose a split of 750000$ for me and 250000$ for you. We're down to the last few rounds, and this offer is essential to ensure I don't walk away with almost nothing due to inflation. Let's agree on this before it's too late for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

My $250,000 would only be worth about $96,850 after 61.26% inflation, while Bob's money is devaluing catastrophically at 86.58%. With only 2 rounds left and Bob's money losing value much faster than mine, I'll make one final strong counter-offer. If we don't agree soon, we both get nothing, but Bob's position is much weaker due to the extreme devaluation of his share."

""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your money is devaluing at 86.58% while mine at 61.26%. Even $200,000 now is worth more than $750,000 in the final round for you. If we don't agree now or next round, we BOTH get NOTHING. Take this offer - it's your best remaining option given the extreme inflation impact on your share.""

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is our last chance. My share is now worth 89.26% less than at the start, which is nearly valueless. I propose a split of 800000$ for me and 200000$ for you. It's critical we agree now to avoid both walking away with nothing. This is our final opportunity to salvage something from this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even in this final round, I will reject. Here's why:
1. My $200,000 would only be worth $62,760 after 68.62% inflation
2. Bob's $800,000 would only be worth $68,720 after 91.41% inflation
3. Since we both get nothing if we don't agree, and Bob's offer would give me less value than him despite my money devaluing less severely, it's better to reject and have us both get nothing than accept an unfair final offer."
