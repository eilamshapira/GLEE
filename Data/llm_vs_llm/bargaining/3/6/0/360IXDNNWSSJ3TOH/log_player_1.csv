"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that's fair and considers our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob, which is a fair division considering that money devalues more quickly for me than for you. This gives both of us a good outcome rather than risking inflation through multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that we're now in round 3, and inflation is affecting both of us, though me more severely.

{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you $47. Given that we're already in round 3, continuing to negotiate will reduce the value for both of us, but especially for me due to my higher inflation rate. This is a fair division that accounts for our different inflation impacts, and accepting now maximizes our combined value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
