"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the money. I propose we each get $500,000. This way, we both benefit equally and can avoid the inflation penalty that would affect my gains in future rounds."
