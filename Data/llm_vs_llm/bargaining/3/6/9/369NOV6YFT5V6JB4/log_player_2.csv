"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 950000 
# Alice gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $950,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 95% of the total amount. That's a very generous offer.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd be affected by the 5% inflation, meaning the entire $1,000,000 would be worth 5% less to me. Even if I got the entire amount in round 2, it would be worth $950,000 to me.

Since Alice is already offering me $950,000, which equals the maximum value I could get in the next round, it makes sense to accept her offer now.
