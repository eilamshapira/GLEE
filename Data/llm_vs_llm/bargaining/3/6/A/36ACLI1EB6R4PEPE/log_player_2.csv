"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant with each round, making it even more crucial to secure a fairer deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800} 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a slight concession from a strictly even split, acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end.  It's a reasonable proposal that still offers Alice a significant sum and avoids the risk of further devaluation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to propose offers where she gains more, even as the money becomes worth significantly less to me due to inflation. Accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half the original value, which is not acceptable.  I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to send a strong signal that I'm serious about getting a fair deal that accounts for the inflation. This offer is a mirror of Alice's opening offer, and while it may seem assertive, it highlights the inequity she has been proposing throughout the game. It also provides her with a sum that is still considerable, especially considering the potential for further devaluation of the money should the game continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is still not ideal, it's getting dangerously close to the point where continued inflation will negate any potential gains from holding out for a better deal. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sum that, although diminished, is better than risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement."
