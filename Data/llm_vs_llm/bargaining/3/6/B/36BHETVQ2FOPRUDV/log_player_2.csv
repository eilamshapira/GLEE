"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it, taking into account the inflation factor that affects my share.

In the first round, Alice offers me $4750, and herself $5250. If I reject this offer, the total amount will decrease by 10% for me in the next round, but I don't know how it affects Alice. However, since I'm trying to maximize my gain, I should consider the worst-case scenario for myself.

Given that the offer is not extremely biased against me and considering the risk of losing value due to inflation, I should evaluate if making a counteroffer could potentially yield a better result for me in subsequent rounds.

However, since this is the first round and the offer is relatively close to a 50/50 split, and considering the risk of inflation reducing my potential earnings in subsequent rounds, I might be inclined to accept this offer to avoid potential losses due to inflation.
