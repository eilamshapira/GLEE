This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While the shrinking pot encourages me to accept, I believe holding out for a better offer is the optimal strategy at this point."

Alice is consistently offering me less than half.  While the inflation is a factor, I still believe I can get a better deal, even if it means settling closer to a 50/50 split in the later rounds."

I'm holding firm on this offer, signaling I'm willing to negotiate but not be exploited despite the increasing pressure from inflation."
