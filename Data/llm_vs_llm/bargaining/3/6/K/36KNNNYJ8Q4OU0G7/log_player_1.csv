"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering potential future rounds and inflation. I want to show cooperation while protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable split where I get slightly more, accounting for potential inflation if Bob declines. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept, my $4500 is actually worth $4050 (90% of original value)
2. If I reject and propose next round, any amount I get will be worth only 80% of original value
3. Bob seems to be experiencing less inflation than me
4. If this continues, my negotiating position will get weaker each round
5. $4050 is still a significant amount, and continuing might lead to worse outcomes

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's not ideal, the inflation rate working against me means I'm likely to get worse deals in future rounds, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds."
