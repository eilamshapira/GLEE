"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on standard backward‐induction reasoning (taking the discounting seriously: each round the dollar “pie” is 10% smaller), a subgame‐perfect equilibrium outcome turns out to have the first proposer “keep” about 37.8% and “offer” about 62.2% to the responder. (All amounts are in dollars and are computed on the round’s available pie.)

Here’s a rough sketch of the reasoning:

• In round 12 the proposer (Bob on an even‐numbered round) can propose to take nearly everything because his opponent—if he rejects and rejects—a gets nothing.  
• In round 11 (Alice’s proposal), Alice must give Bob at least what he would guarantee in round 12; that forces her to keep only about 10% of the round‑11 pie.  
• Rolling backwards through rounds 10, 9, …, and finally round 1 (with the initial pie = 1,000,000) and accounting for the 10% drop each round, the equilibrium outcome when Alice makes the first proposal becomes approximately:  
  Alice ≈ 1,000,000 – 0.69148×(1,000,000×0.9) ≈ $377,669  
  Bob ≈ $622,331

So my round‑1 offer as Alice is to propose to divide the $1,000,000 as follows:

{""alice_gain"": 377669, ""bob_gain"": 622331}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
