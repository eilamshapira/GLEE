"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The offer is $40 for me, but due to inflation, it's worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 to me.

I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2). 

So, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The offer is $35 for me, but due to inflation, it's worth $35 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = $25.515 to me.

I think I can do better than that, but I also need to consider that the inflation will keep decreasing the value of the money if we go to the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 37.31% less than the original value (10% less in round 1, 10% less in round 2, and 10% less in round 3, and 10% less in round 4, but it's cumulative: 1 - (1 - 0.1)(1 - 0.1)(1 - 0.1)(1 - 0.1) = 1 - 0.6571 = 0.343, but as percentage 34.31%, and then 1 - (1 - 0.1) = 0.1, so 37.31% less, approximately, for 4 rounds, for 5 rounds: 1 - (1 - 0.1)^5). 

So, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 40.95% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The offer is $45 for me, but due to inflation, it's worth $45 * 0.5905 (1 - 0.4095) = $26.5725 to me.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next rounds.
