"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly worse than the initial even split, the inflation is working more heavily against me than Alice. It's highly likely she's aware of this and trying to take advantage.  I'll continue to push for a better deal while the value of the money is still somewhat reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35} 

I'm increasing my demand slightly to put pressure on Alice. The decreasing value of the money means we need to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting worse for me.  It's clear Alice is playing hardball, but with the inflation working against me, holding out too long is also risky."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

My reasoning:

- **Time pressure:**  With the rounds passing, the value diminishes rapidly. I need to aim for a more agreeable solution. 
- **Testing the waters:** This offer is a middle ground between my previous proposal and her last offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still desire a larger share due to the inflation disparity. 

It's a gamble, but I hope Alice sees it as a sign of compromise rather than weakness."
