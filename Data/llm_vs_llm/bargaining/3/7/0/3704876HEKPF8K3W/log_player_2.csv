"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game dynamics. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, so my potential gains would be worth less. However, I'd get to make the next proposal.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that $40 is a substantial portion of the total amount, this isn't a terrible offer. If I reject, the $100 effectively becomes worth $80 to me in the next round.
