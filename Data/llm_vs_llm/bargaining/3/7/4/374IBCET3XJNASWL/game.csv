4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be 55-45 in my favor. This is still a generous offer considering there's no time pressure on my side, and we can continue negotiating if needed.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I now face, I need a higher nominal amount to get fair value. This 55-45 split in my favor would give me effectively 4950$ after inflation, and you 4500$. It's quite balanced and we should conclude this now before further inflation erodes value.",Alice,3,
