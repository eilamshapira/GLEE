"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from prolonging negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. There's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds
3. As I can make the next offer if I reject, I could potentially get a better deal
4. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds

Given that I have no inflation pressure and can make the next offer, I can try to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be 55-45 in my favor. This is still a generous offer considering there's no time pressure on my side, and we can continue negotiating if needed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I now face, I need a higher nominal amount to get fair value. This 55-45 split in my favor would give me effectively 4950$ after inflation, and you 4500$. It's quite balanced and we should conclude this now before further inflation erodes value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 (45%)
2. She's claiming inflation affects her gains by 9.75%, making her $5,500 effectively worth about $4,950
3. I'm not affected by inflation at all
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Alice's inflation penalty will increase further

While I could try to negotiate for more, the offer of $4,500 is reasonable, and there's a risk that continued negotiation might lead to a deadlock or worse outcomes. The current split is fairly balanced when considering Alice's inflation penalty.
