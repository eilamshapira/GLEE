Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that each round devalues our total pot, settling now is in both our interests. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you â€” a fair compromise that avoids further loss in value. Let's finalize this deal and both come out ahead! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
