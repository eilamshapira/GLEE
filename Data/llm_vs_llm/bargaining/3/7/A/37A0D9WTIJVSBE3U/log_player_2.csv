"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer Alice is making is quite fair. She's offering me $5,200 (52%) while taking $4,800 (48%) for herself. This is actually slightly favorable to me, and seems like a reasonable division that's close to an even split.
