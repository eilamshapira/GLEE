"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), this is a good deal for you to accept now rather than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a fairer split. I'm offering 52 for me and 48 for you. This acknowledges the devaluation difference, but also gives me a slightly better return to compensate for rejecting your initial offer. It's beneficial for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation difference works in my favor, and Bob's offer gives him more than me despite that. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that better reflects our relative positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""I've reduced my share from my initial offer to show good faith. But remember, with 10% inflation on your side vs 5% on mine, accepting now is better than waiting. This split is fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
