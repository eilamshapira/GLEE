"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, get $40. Alice gets $60. I need to consider the potential impact of inflation if I reject.

If I reject, the money's value decreases. Next round, my ""real"" money will be worth 5% less and Alice's 10% less. I want to make sure I won't receive much less than 40 in the next round.

Considering this is the first round, and $40 isn't terrible, I will accept.
