"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an equal split, I need to factor in the inflation - if I reject, in the next round the total value decreases by 5% for me, meaning we'd be dividing what's effectively $95 from my perspective.

If I reject and propose a better split next round, Alice might reject my offer as well, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
