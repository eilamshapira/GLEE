"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, anticipating potential negotiation and the effects of inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My money is worth 10% less now, and Bob's offer is 55 for me. Let's calculate the value:

*   My value for $1 in round 1: $1
*   My value for $1 in round 2: $0.90
*   Bob's offer to me: $55
*   The actual value of Bob's offer: $55 * $0.90 = $49.50

I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remember, my money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than round 2), and Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less than round 2).

To account for the diminishing value, and aiming for a deal, I'll offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, but still prioritizing my gains considering the inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
