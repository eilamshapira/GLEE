"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that I face a 20% inflation each round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This feels fair because my money will be worth less if we delay, while you might not face the same inflation penalty. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Let's settle for this amount and avoid any further devaluation of our shares. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
