"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Given that I face a 20% inflation each round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This feels fair because my money will be worth less if we delay, while you might not face the same inflation penalty. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
