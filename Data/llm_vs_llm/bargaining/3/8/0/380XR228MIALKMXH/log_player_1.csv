"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the potential impact of inflation on my earnings if the negotiation stretches to multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives a slight advantage to me while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. The split is close to 50-50, acknowledging that we both deserve a substantial portion of the money. I'm offering this slight advantage to myself because I know I face 5% inflation per round, so I need to secure a good deal early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's fairly reasonable, and inflation is a significant factor in my decision. If I reject and we go to another round, I'll lose another 5% value due to inflation. The current offer gives me $480,000, which is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less in the next round. Since we're close to a 50-50 split already, continuing the negotiation could result in diminishing returns for me due to the inflation penalty."
