500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally. This is fair for both of us, and since there's no inflation affecting me, we can resolve this now without risking our shares in future rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one affected by inflation. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand that you're affected by inflation. Let's compromise - I'll take 450k and you take 550k. This is better than my initial offer and accounts for your inflation concerns. If we continue going back and forth, you'll lose more to inflation, and we both risk getting nothing in the end.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your attempt to compromise, but considering the inflation is only affecting me, I think I need a bigger share to make up for the loss in value. This is my new proposal, and I hope you'll consider it to avoid further losses for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Bob, I understand inflation is affecting you significantly. I'm offering you 580k, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. If we keep negotiating, your inflation will get worse. We're halfway through our rounds now, and this is a fair compromise that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being reasonable for me. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,5,
