Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one affected by inflation. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game before the money loses more value.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

We're halfway through our rounds now, and this is a fair compromise that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being reasonable for me. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
