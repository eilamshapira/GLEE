"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally. This is fair for both of us, and since there's no inflation affecting me, we can resolve this now without risking our shares in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one affected by inflation. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're affected by inflation. Let's compromise - I'll take 450k and you take 550k. This is better than my initial offer and accounts for your inflation concerns. If we continue going back and forth, you'll lose more to inflation, and we both risk getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation is affecting you significantly. I'm offering you 580k, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. If we keep negotiating, your inflation will get worse. We're halfway through our rounds now, and this is a fair compromise that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being reasonable for me. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000
