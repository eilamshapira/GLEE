"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer considering the 5% inflation per round if I reject.

Currently, Alice is offering me $45 out of $100. If I reject, the next round's money would be worth 5% less to me, so the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. I could then make a counter-offer.

While I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer, there's also the risk of continued negotiation and further depreciation. $45 now is a reasonable offer given the inflation pressure.
