"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2649.08, ""bob_gain"": 7350.92, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my offer. I keep $2,649.08 and you get $7,350.92. Think about it: If you reject and wait until Round 2 to propose, the 5% per‐round depreciation will cost you. In equilibrium, you’d be able to secure around $7,350.92 (in today’s dollars) by waiting, so this offer gives you exactly that. Let’s agree and avoid unnecessary delays!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your strategy, but I think you can do better. How about you take $2262.66 and I take $7737.34? This way, you still get a good amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the depreciation I'm experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 2262.66 
# Bob gain: 7737.34 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it gives me only $2,262.66—less than what I’d be able to secure by waiting and making my proposal in Round 3 where my share isn’t depreciated. Given that my continuation value would be higher if I reject and propose in the next round, I must decline this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 499, ""bob_gain"": 9501, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my Round 3 proposal. Remember, your dollars now are worth 10% less than in Round 1, and if you wait for Round 4 your depreciation will increase to about 14.3% (a multiplier of roughly 0.8574). In equilibrium, if you reject, you'll be able to secure an effective payoff of about $8,574 (in Round‐1 equivalent value) in Round 4. To match that in Round 3—the dollars here being worth about 90.25% of their face value—I must offer you roughly $9,500 in nominal terms. I’m giving you a slightly better deal by offering $9,501 (which, at 0.9025 of face value, comes to approximately $8,574.45 in Round‐1 terms) and keeping $499 for myself. I believe this slight improvement over your continuation value makes acceptance the rational move. Let's settle now rather than risk further losses from inflation.""}"
