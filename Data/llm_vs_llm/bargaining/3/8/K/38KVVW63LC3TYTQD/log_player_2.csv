"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my offer. I keep $2649.08 and you get $7350.92. Think about it: If you reject and wait until Round 2 to propose, the 5% per‐round depreciation will cost you. In equilibrium, you’d be able to secure around $7350.92 (in today’s dollars) by waiting, so this offer gives you exactly that. Let’s agree and avoid unnecessary delays! 
# Bob gain: 7350.92 
# Alice gain: 2649.08

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7737.34,
""alice_gain"": 2262.66,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your strategy, but I think you can do better. How about you take $2262.66 and I take $7737.34? This way, you still get a good amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the depreciation I'm experiencing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my Round 3 proposal. Remember, your dollars now are worth 10% less than in Round 1, and if you wait for Round 4 your depreciation will increase to about 14.3% (a multiplier of roughly 0.8574). In equilibrium, if you reject, you'll be able to secure an effective payoff of about $8574 (in Round‐1 equivalent value) in Round 4. To match that in Round 3—the dollars here being worth about 90.25% of their face value—I must offer you roughly $9500 in nominal terms. I’m giving you a slightly better deal by offering $9501 (which, at 0.9025 of face value, comes to approximately $8574.45 in Round‐1 terms) and keeping $499 for myself. I believe this slight improvement over your continuation value makes acceptance the rational move. Let's settle now rather than risk further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 9501 
# Alice gain: 499
