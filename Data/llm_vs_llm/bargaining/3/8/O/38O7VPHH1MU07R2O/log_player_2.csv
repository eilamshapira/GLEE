"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, would get $400,000. If I reject, the value of the money decreases by 5% for me in the next round. This means my potential gain needs to be significantly higher than $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000 in the next round to make it worthwhile. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and Alice gets to decide the next offer, it's risky to reject.
