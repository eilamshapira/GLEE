"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. Take it while it's still worth something! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $30, but it's worth 20% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 0.8 * $30 = $24.

Since Bob's offer is quite biased towards himself, I think I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100%.
In Round 2, the money was worth 80% for me and 90% for Bob.
In Round 3, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 64% for me and 0.9 * 0.9 = 81% for Bob.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before the money loses more value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  We're losing money every round! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

The money I gain is worth 48.8% less than the original value, which means it's worth 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value.
So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $35, but it's worth 0.512 * $35 = $17.92.

Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think I should try to get a better deal. However, since Bob's offer is not extremely biased, and we are losing money every round, I might need to reconsider my strategy.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 51.2% for me and 72.9% for Bob (calculated as 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%) in Round 4, and it will decrease further in Round 5, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer.

In Round 5, the money is worth 0.512 * 0.8 = 40.96% for me and 0.729 * 0.9 = 65.61% for Bob.

Considering the decreasing value, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to Bob, hoping he'll accept:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, we're both losing money. This is a fair offer.""}"
