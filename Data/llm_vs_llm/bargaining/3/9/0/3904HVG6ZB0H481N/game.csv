4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle now before any delay hurts my share. I'm proposing to divide the $10000 as $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This way, you get a slightly larger share, while we both avoid the further 20% drop in value for my portion in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution for both of usâ€”looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation for a better share.",Bob,2,
