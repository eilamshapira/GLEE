"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle now before any delay hurts my share. I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 as $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This way, you get a slightly larger share, while we both avoid the further 20% drop in value for my portion in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution for both of usâ€”looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation for a better share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
