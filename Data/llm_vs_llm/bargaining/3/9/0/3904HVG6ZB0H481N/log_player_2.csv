"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle now before any delay hurts my share. I'm proposing to divide the $10000 as $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This way, you get a slightly larger share, while we both avoid the further 20% drop in value for my portion in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution for both of usâ€”looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation for a better share.""}"
