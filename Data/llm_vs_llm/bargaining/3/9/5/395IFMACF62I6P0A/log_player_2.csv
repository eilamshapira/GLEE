"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split, giving each of us $50. This is a fair and equitable division of the $100. Since there's no inflation affecting my share across rounds (0% inflation for me), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's also no guaranteed advantage to rejecting a fair offer.

Given the fair nature of this proposal and the uncertainty about how inflation might affect Alice's position, I'll accept this offer.
