"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I propose we take a little more than half to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. She wants to take $550,000, citing inflation risk
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. My money doesn't lose value due to inflation (0% effect)
5. This is a 45-55 split, which isn't too far from equal

While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, this is a fairly reasonable offer. Since I don't lose anything to inflation and the split is relatively fair, there's no strong reason to risk rejection by being too greedy.
