"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. The total amount is $1,000,000
2. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%)
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it

If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 next round due to inflation. To make a better deal, I would need to secure significantly more than $500,000 in the next round just to break even after inflation.

While 40% isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting this offer the more prudent choice.
