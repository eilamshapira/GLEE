7500.0,2500.0,"Alice, I understand your wish to steer the split, but as we move forward the stakes change – every extra round hurts you much more than me. In round 3 your money will devalue by 40% compared to today, and while I’m quite patient with just a 5% drop, the numbers simply won’t add up in your favor if we wait. Accept this offer now: you receive $7500 and I get $2500 – it’s the best we can both do given the rapidly falling values.",Bob,2,
