"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your wish to steer the split, but as we move forward the stakes change – every extra round hurts you much more than me. In round 3 your money will devalue by 40% compared to today, and while I’m quite patient with just a 5% drop, the numbers simply won’t add up in your favor if we wait. Accept this offer now: you receive $7500 and I get $2500 – it’s the best we can both do given the rapidly falling values. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
