"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your wish to steer the split, but as we move forward the stakes change – every extra round hurts you much more than me. In round 3 your money will devalue by 40% compared to today, and while I’m quite patient with just a 5% drop, the numbers simply won’t add up in your favor if we wait. Accept this offer now: you receive $7,500 and I get $2,500 – it’s the best we can both do given the rapidly falling values.""}"
