"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose this split accounting for the 10% inflation I'll face each round. If we go back and forth, we both lose value, so this slightly higher split for me balances the inflation penalty I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500, which is less than half of $10,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. After my 10% inflation penalty, $4,500 now is better than $5,000 next round (which would be worth $4,500 after inflation)
4. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value due to inflation
5. This is actually a reasonable first offer considering the inflation dynamics

While I could reject and counter-offer, the inflation penalty means I likely won't get a significantly better deal, and we risk losing value in continued negotiations.
