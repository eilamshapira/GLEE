"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob faces a 20% depreciation each round while I face 0%, I have a stronger position. If Bob rejects my offer now, the next round will be worth $800,000 to him at most. I should leverage this knowledge.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if you reject and counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to you. Even if you offered me nothing next round, you'd only get $800,000 in value. This offer gives you $400,000 now, which is 50% of your maximum possible value next round.""}"
