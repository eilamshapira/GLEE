"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if you reject and counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to you. Even if you offered me nothing next round, you'd only get $800000 in value. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is 50% of your maximum possible value next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
