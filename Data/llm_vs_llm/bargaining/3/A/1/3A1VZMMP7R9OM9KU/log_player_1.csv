"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty for me if we proceed to additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I suggest this division because it's close to fair while giving Bob a substantial portion. Since I face a 5% penalty per round while Bob doesn't, there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob slightly less than half but is still generous enough that it should be acceptable to him rather than moving to another round where he might gain more but the total amount would be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of an equal split. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, the 5% inflation penalty means any future gains would be worth less to me. A fair 50/50 split is reasonable, and accepting now is better than risking further depreciation of my share through additional negotiation rounds."
