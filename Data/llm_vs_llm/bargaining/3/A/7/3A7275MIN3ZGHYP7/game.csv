5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly this time. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can wait for better offers, but you might face inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering the game dynamics.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,How about a slightly better split for both of us? I think we can find common ground here.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I see that inflation is affecting your gains significantly. My proposal gives you $3500 now, which is better than potentially less value later due to increasing inflation. Remember, we only have 8 more rounds, and the inflation rate seems to be increasing for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
