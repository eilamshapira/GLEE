Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can wait for better offers, but you might face inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering the game dynamics.

# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that inflation is affecting your gains significantly. My proposal gives you $3500 now, which is better than potentially less value later due to increasing inflation. Remember, we only have 8 more rounds, and the inflation rate seems to be increasing for you.

# Bob gain: 6500
