"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While an even split seems fair, I should consider the game dynamics. Since I'm going first and have the option to make a counter-proposal, I could potentially get a better deal. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by extending the game. However, Alice might face inflation, which could give me leverage in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can wait for better offers, but you might face inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering the game dynamics.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a slightly better split for both of us? I think we can find common ground here. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now facing inflation (19% less value for her), which confirms my assumption that waiting benefits me. Alice has improved her offer to give me $5500 instead of the initial $5000. This is better than the first offer, but I still have the advantage of time since I don't face inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I see that inflation is affecting your gains significantly. My proposal gives you $3500 now, which is better than potentially less value later due to increasing inflation. Remember, we only have 8 more rounds, and the inflation rate seems to be increasing for you.""}"
