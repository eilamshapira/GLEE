6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 10% inflation for me each round, we should agree quickly to maximize what we both get. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, since we've each lost value due to inflation, I propose an even split. This way, we both benefit equally despite the shrinking value.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 57-43 split. Due to the inflation penalty I face (now 20% total), this is actually fair for both of us. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 10% value, which hurts us both. This offer balances our interests - let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting your gains, but I believe I deserve a bit more. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can reach an agreement without waiting longer.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I've reconsidered our positions. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more modest than my previous offers. With the 34.4% inflation penalty I now face, this is increasingly urgent for both of us. If we continue haggling, we'll both leave with less value. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with something meaningful.",Alice,5,

4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is impacting both of us. I propose a 58-42 split, which is slightly more favorable for me but still allows you to receive a decent amount. Let's finalize this agreement.",Bob,6,
