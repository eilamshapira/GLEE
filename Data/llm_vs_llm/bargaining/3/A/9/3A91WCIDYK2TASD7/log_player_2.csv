"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 10% inflation for me each round, we should agree quickly to maximize what we both get. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,""alice_gain"": 5000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we've each lost value due to inflation, I propose an even split. This way, we both benefit equally despite the shrinking value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 57-43 split. Due to the inflation penalty I face (now 20% total), this is actually fair for both of us. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 10% value, which hurts us both. This offer balances our interests - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reconsidered our positions. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more modest than my previous offers. With the 34.4% inflation penalty I now face, this is increasingly urgent for both of us. If we continue haggling, we'll both leave with less value. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with something meaningful. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
