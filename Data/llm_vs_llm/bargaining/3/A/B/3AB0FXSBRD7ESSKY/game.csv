6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering we both want to benefit, and inflation is eating away at the value. Let's take a good deal now!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be reasonable, 50/50 is the fairest split. Considering inflation, it's in our best interest to agree sooner rather than later. My offer is more generous than a straight split, so let's end this here.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm offering you $4700, which is more than half considering the inflation affecting your side. I'm still taking a bit more, but let's be realistic and grab this deal before it's worth even less.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Inflation is indeed eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the most fair, considering we're both losing value with each passing round. Let's split it down the middle and walk away before it's too late.",Bob,4,

5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, time is running out. My offer is $5100 for me, $4900 for you. It's almost 50/50 but reflects the slight advantage of being the proposer. Let's just take this and be done!",Alice,5,
