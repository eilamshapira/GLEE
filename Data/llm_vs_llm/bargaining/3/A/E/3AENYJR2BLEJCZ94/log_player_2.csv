"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be worth 80% of the original amount to me. So even if I managed to get a larger share in the next round, I need to weigh that against the diminishing value.

Given that I would receive $40 now (which is a substantial portion) versus the risk of getting less overall value after inflation in future rounds, I will accept this offer.
