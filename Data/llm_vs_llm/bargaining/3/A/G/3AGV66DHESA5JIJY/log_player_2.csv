"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tricky situation. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, which is less than half. Since we're playing with inflation where each round makes the money worth 10% less for me, I need to consider whether waiting and making a counter-offer is worth it.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, even if I proposed a 50-50 split, my $50 would effectively be worth only $45 (due to 10% inflation for me). So Alice's current offer of $45 is equivalent to what I'd get in the best reasonable scenario next round.

Given the inflation penalty I face, this is actually a fair offer.
