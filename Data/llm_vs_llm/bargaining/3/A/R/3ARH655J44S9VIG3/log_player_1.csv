"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to compensate for my higher inflation rate. This way we both benefit from a quick agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your rate is decreasing faster than mine, Alice.  Let's settle this quickly with a split that recognizes that - I'm willing to take a bit less than half. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Current value for me: $520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000
Current value for Bob: $480,000 * 0.95 = $456,000

If I reject and we go to next round:
- My money will be worth another 10% less
- His money will be worth another 5% less
- I might be able to negotiate a better split, but the total value is decreasing quickly

Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation rates. If I reject, even if I get a larger share next round, it will be worth less due to my higher inflation rate. Better to accept now.
