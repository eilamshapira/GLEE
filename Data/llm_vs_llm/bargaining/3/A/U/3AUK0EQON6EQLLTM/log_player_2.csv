"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round
3. In the next round, the maximum I could get would be worth 80% of current value
4. 80% of $1,000,000 = $800,000, so even a maximum offer next round would be less valuable
5. $400,000 is a substantial amount, even if not perfectly equal

Given the inflation penalty and that this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
