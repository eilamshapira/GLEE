"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

A 60-40 split with Alice getting $600,000 and me getting $400,000. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However:

1. If I reject, I can make the next offer
2. The 10% inflation penalty isn't too severe for one round
3. I could potentially negotiate a better deal

I believe I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""A more equitable 52-48 split. We both lose money if we keep negotiating due to inflation.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's closer to a 50-50 split, which feels fair
2. I'm still giving Alice a slight advantage ($520K vs $480K)
3. I'm reminding her about the inflation penalty to discourage further negotiation
4. The difference from her original offer isn't so dramatic that it would appear hostile"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering $420K to me and $580K to herself
2. Due to 19% inflation, my $420K is actually worth about $340K in round 1 terms
3. If I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation (27.1%)
4. She did move from her original 60-40 split towards a more balanced split
5. Further negotiation will significantly reduce the real value for both of us

Given the significant inflation penalty we're already facing and the risk of losing even more value in additional rounds, I should accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation makes further negotiation too costly.
