"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I face a 20% inflation penalty in each round. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit without losing value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation penalty, I propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. This still leaves you with a substantial amount, and we can both avoid losing more value to inflation by settling now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
