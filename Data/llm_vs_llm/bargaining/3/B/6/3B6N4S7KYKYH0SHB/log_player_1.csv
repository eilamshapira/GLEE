Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me as I'm making the first move, but it's still quite fair. Let's avoid losing value through inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. We both get the same amount and avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of an even split. This is a fair proposal and accepting it now means we avoid further value loss from inflation. With a 50-50 split of $10,000, we each get $5,000, which is better than risking further rounds where the total value would decrease by 10% each time."
