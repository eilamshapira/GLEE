"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the 5% inflation risk I face if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose this division because I want to offer Bob a substantial portion while protecting myself from potential inflation losses in future rounds. The slightly higher amount for me (52.5%) accounts for the risk I face from inflation if we need more rounds. It's a balanced offer that gives Bob strong incentive to accept while being fair to both parties."
