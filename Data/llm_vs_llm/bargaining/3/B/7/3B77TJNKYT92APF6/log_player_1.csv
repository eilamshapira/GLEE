"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 45-55 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer, I get $550,000 (worth full value)
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less for Bob due to inflation
   * I could potentially get more, but Bob might reject again
   * My first offer of $600,000 was rejected
3. $550,000 is a decent amount, not too far from my initial proposal
4. Bob is already experiencing 5% inflation on his share
5. Further delays might lead to a worse outcome for both of us

Given these factors, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
