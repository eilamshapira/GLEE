"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This split gives us both a significant amount, and avoids further losses from inflation. 60/40 split is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed a 60/40 split where she gets $600,000 and I get $400,000.

The inflation rates are important here. If I reject, I'll face a 20% devaluation per round while Alice only faces 5%. This significant difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

If I reject and propose my own offer in round 2, even if I ask for more, the total pot is effectively worth less to me due to the 20% inflation. Also, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even greater inflation impacts in later rounds.

Given the asymmetric inflation that heavily disadvantages me, taking $400,000 now is likely better than risking further devaluation by continuing to negotiate.
