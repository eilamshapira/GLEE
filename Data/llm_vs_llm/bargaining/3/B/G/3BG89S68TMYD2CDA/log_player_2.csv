"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a split where I would get $45 and she would get $55. The game rules mention that the money doesn't lose value for me with inflation, but I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, there's no pressure for me to accept immediately due to declining value. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself.

However, Alice's current offer is relatively fair, giving me 45% of the total. If I'm too aggressive in the next round, she might reject my offer, prolonging the game.

Given that the split is reasonably fair and there's no guarantee I'd end up with more by continuing, I'll reject this offer to make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly more balanced split while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even 50/50 split of the $100, which I believe is fair to both of us."
