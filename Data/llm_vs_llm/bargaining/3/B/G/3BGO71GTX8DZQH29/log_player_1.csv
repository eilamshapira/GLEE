"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that's fair for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint welfare."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
