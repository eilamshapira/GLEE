"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair split considering I'm making the first move, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While it's slightly less valuable due to the 5% inflation, it's still a fair proposal and better than risking further value loss in subsequent rounds. With the 5% inflation, each of us will effectively get $4,750, which is reasonable."
