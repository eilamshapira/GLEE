"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting you more. However, since we're now in round 2, we're already facing inflation. I'm proposing a split that gives me $5200 and you $4800. This is fair because even though you face higher inflation, accepting now preserves more total value for both of us than continuing to negotiate further rounds. Let's finalize this deal now before inflation erodes more value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
