"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4000 out of $10,000, which is less than half of the total amount. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value by 10% for me.

Let me think about this: If I reject, the total amount will still be $10,000, but it will be worth 10% less to me, meaning it's effectively worth $9,000 to me. I could propose a more favorable split, but there's also risk that Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since $4000 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller effective amount later (due to inflation), I'll accept this offer.
