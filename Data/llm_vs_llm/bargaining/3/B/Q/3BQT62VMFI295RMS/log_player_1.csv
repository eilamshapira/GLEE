Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 10% decrease in value for me in the previous round and another 10% decrease in this round, the total value decrease for me is 20% (10% + 10% = 20% decrease, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value). However, I'll make an offer based on the nominal values.
