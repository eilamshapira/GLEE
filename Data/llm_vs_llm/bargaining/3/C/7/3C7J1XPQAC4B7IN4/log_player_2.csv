"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make an offer
3. $400,000 now is better than $450,000 next round due to the 10% inflation
4. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
5. First round offers are often a good indicator of the other player's strategy
6. $400,000 is a substantial amount, even if not perfectly equal
