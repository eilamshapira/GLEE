"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My initial $10,000 is now effectively worth 5% less to me.  So I need to recalculate my value based on $9500. Bob's $10,000 has an effective decrease of 10%.

Now considering the new values:

*   Alice's adjusted amount: $9500
*   Alice's gain: $4500 (as proposed by Bob)
*   Bob's adjusted amount: $9000
*   Bob's gain: $5500 (as proposed by Bob)

I must consider this carefully. While Bob's offer gives me less than my previous offer, it's still more than half of the remaining ""value"" of the money for me (4500/9500 is not quite half). If I reject, I may get even less. The inflation is a real threat.

Given these circumstances, I will **accept** Bob's offer.
