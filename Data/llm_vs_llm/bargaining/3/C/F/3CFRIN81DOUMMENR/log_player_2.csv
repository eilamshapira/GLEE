"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally, 50/50. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which would give me $5,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means even if I got the full $10,000 next round, it would only be worth $9,000 to me.

The current offer of $5,000 is better than any amount I could get next round after accounting for inflation, since I'd need to get more than $5,555 just to break even ($5,555 * 0.9 = $5,000).

Given these circumstances, accepting the equal split is the rational choice.
