We're getting close to the point where Alice's rapidly depreciating share will make her offers more appealing to me.  I need to apply more pressure."

It's getting risky now. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me something before inflation eats away too much, and before we hit the 12 round limit."
