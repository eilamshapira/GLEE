"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this offer is still fair for both of us. Let's make a deal before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. While Bob mentioned inflation affecting his side, the split still isn't equitable given that I'm not affected by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Since I'm not affected by inflation and you are, this split actually gives you a fair amount considering the 5% inflation rate you're experiencing. This way we both get roughly equal real value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation affecting me more each round, I think this split is fair. It allows us both to walk away with a reasonable amount before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation on Bob's side actually strengthens my bargaining position - there's more urgency for Bob to reach a deal. I'll make a better offer for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""With inflation reducing your money's value by over 14%, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer ensures you still get a meaningful amount, while recognizing my stronger position since I'm not affected by inflation.""}"
