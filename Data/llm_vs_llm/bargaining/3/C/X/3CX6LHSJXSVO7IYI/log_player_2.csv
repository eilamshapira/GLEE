"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is:
1. Fair and equitable
2. A reasonable starting point
3. Ensures I get a decent amount ($50)

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, there are risks:
1. Inflation will reduce the value in future rounds
2. Alice might make less favorable offers later
3. We might run out of rounds and both get nothing

Given these factors, a guaranteed $50 is a good outcome.
