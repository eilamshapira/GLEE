"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to factor in that each round reduces the value of my money by 20%.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be worth 20% less, so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I got a better percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower.
