"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $200,000 while taking $800,000 for herself. This is only 20% of the total amount for me, which seems quite unfair given we're starting on equal footing. While I need to be mindful of the 20% inflation penalty per round, I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a split where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. This is a reasonable division that gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation penalty I face, while still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money. This way we can both walk away with a good outcome rather than risk further rounds of declining value."
