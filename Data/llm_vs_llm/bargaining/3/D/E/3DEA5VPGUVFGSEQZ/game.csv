6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm affected by 5% inflation each round. Let's make a deal now to maximize value for both of us.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's do a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a bit less than your initial offer, but it's still a good amount and we avoid more inflation. Let's secure our gains now.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm now facing 10% cumulative inflation on my share. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair - you get the same $4500 I just rejected, and I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's reach an agreement now before further value erosion.",Alice,3,
