"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm affected by 5% inflation each round. Let's make a deal now to maximize value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's do a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a bit less than your initial offer, but it's still a good amount and we avoid more inflation. Let's secure our gains now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now facing 10% cumulative inflation on my share. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair - you get the same $4500 I just rejected, and I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's reach an agreement now before further value erosion. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
