"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. It's crucial to secure a deal soon.
* **Bob's Rejection:** Bob rejecting my initial 60/40 split suggests he might be aiming for a slightly better deal for himself.
* **Compromise:** This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer but still ensures I get a larger share while hopefully being tempting enough for Bob to accept."
