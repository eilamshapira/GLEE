"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equally, $500000 each. This way, we both get a fair share without any need for further rounds. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

A 50-50 split would normally be very fair, but I need to consider the 5% depreciation per round for my share.

In this first round, there's no depreciation yet, so I would get the full $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, my money would be worth 5% less, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept my offer.

This is actually a very reasonable first offer from Alice, and getting a guaranteed $500,000 now is better than risking depreciation in future rounds or potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
