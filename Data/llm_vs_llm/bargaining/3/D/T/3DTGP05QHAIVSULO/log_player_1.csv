"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll consider the 10% inflation effect on my gains with each passing round, and I want to make a fair yet strategic first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest we split the money 60/40, with me taking $6,000 and you receiving $4,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for the risk of inflation to me if we go to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
