"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer. Since we're facing a 10% inflation for me each round, I'd like to propose a fair but strategic split that incentivizes early agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a substantial portion of $450,000, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement. The longer we negotiate, the less valuable the money becomes for me due to inflation, so I hope you find this offer reasonable so we can both walk away with significant value."
