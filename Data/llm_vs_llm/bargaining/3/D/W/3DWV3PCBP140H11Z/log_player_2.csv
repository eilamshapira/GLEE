"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 843370 
# Alice gain: 156630 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. Alice is offering me $843,370 (84.3%) of the $1M
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
3. Alice's money will depreciate 20% each round
4. We have 12 rounds total to reach an agreement

This is actually a very generous first offer from Alice. I could try to negotiate for more, but:
1. My next counter-offer would be worth 5% less to me
2. The money would be worth 20% less to Alice, which might make her less likely to accept
3. The first offer giving me 84.3% is already quite favorable
