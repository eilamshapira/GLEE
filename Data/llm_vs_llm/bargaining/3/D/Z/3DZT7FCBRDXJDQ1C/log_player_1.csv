"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the potential for inflation affecting my gains in later rounds. I'll aim for a reasonable offer that Bob might accept to avoid the risk of losing value.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer. Now Bob is offering me $45, while he gets $55. The money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation.

Let's think this through. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I need to weigh the risk of further devaluation against the potential of getting a better offer later.

Even though I would prefer a higher amount, given the inflation and the risk of future offers being worse, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
