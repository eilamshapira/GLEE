"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make a quick deal. I get 90% and you get 10%. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice's offer would give me $100,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, I should consider the time pressure, but this first offer seems too low.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 20% inflation, I can still propose a more favorable split. The current offer is quite unfair, and since it's only the first round, I have room to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid the effects of inflation by agreeing now. It's fair and reasonable for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value of the money is decreasing. My offer is now 65/35, the best you'll get. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

With 36% inflation for me, the $350,000 offer would be worth effectively:
$350,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $224,000

This is significantly better than the first offer, and Alice has moved considerably from her initial 90/10 split. However, since Alice's inflation rate (19%) is lower than mine (36%), she may be more willing to negotiate further.

That said, the increasing inflation rate for me is concerning. If I reject, my next offer will be worth even less to me, and Alice seems to understand she has this advantage. Additionally, we've already used 3 of our 12 rounds, and the inflation gap between us will continue to grow.

Given these factors, and that this is actually a reasonable offer considering the circumstances...
