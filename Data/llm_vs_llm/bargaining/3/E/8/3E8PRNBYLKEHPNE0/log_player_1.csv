"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the time limit and the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable offer for myself, but it's not greedy. I want to ensure Bob has an incentive to accept in the early rounds when the money's value is higher for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has countered with an offer that favors him more. I need to consider the inflation and the remaining rounds.

Let's analyze:

*   **My Valuation:** $45 in this round is worth 5% less than in round 1. So, it's like receiving $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 from the original $100.
*   **Remaining Rounds:** We have 11 rounds left.
*   **Alternative:** If I reject, I get to make an offer in the next round, but the money will be worth even less.

Given the circumstances, even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, receiving $42.75 equivalent is better than risking further devaluation.
