"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

Since any delay cuts my share by 20% per round while yours remains full value, I’m aware that if we don’t agree now, you’ll soon hold all the bargaining power. To be fair and efficient, I propose you receive the entire $10000, leaving me nothing. I believe it’s best for both of us to settle immediately, so please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is actually the optimal offer from Alice. She correctly recognizes that due to her 20% depreciation per round while Bob faces no depreciation, she has very little bargaining power. If Bob rejects, any future rounds would only decrease Alice's share value while Bob's remains constant. Since Alice is offering the entire amount to Bob, there's no way for Bob to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Therefore, accepting is the rational choice."
