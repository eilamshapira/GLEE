"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer in Round 2 was heavily skewed in his favor. By Round 3, his share is worth even less to him due to the 20% inflation.  I'm betting he'll be more amenable to a deal that is still slightly in his favor, but less extreme than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I'm likely to get if I reject and we go another round.  The inflation is eating into both our potential gains, but hitting Bob's side harder. It's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer now than risk getting an even worse one later."
