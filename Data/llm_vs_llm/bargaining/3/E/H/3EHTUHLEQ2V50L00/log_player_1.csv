"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an “equilibrium‐thinking” offer. (Note: There’s a long procedure behind it based on backward induction over 12 rounds with discount factors—each round the dollar value for you declines 10% and for Bob 5%. Roughly speaking, if no agreement is reached early, then by round 12 the proposer can claim almost everything; “waiting” then has a cost. Working backward, when it’s your (Alice’s) turn in Round 1 you must give Bob just enough (in nominal dollars) so that he’s indifferent between accepting now (getting full value of his share immediately) and waiting for Round 2 to propose his own division.)

A (rough) backward‐induction analysis gives a “fair” equilibrium offer at Round 1 of about:
 Alice: $210,113
 Bob: $789,887

That is, if you (Alice) propose:
 {""alice_gain"": 210113, ""bob_gain"": 789887}

Bob’s “outside option” (if he rejects and becomes the proposer in Round 2) is worth roughly $789,887 in today’s dollars. Hence this offer makes him indifferent to waiting, and you get as much as you can while still keeping him on board.

I now send my offer as JSON:

{""alice_gain"": 210113, ""bob_gain"": 789887}"
