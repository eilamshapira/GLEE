"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 and taking $600,000 for herself.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me (so $900,000 effective value), but 20% less to Alice (so $800,000 effective value). This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round, where I'll make the offer.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I can likely secure a better deal for myself by moving to the next round where I can propose the split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll account for the fact that the money is already worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice due to the first round of inflation. I want to propose a split that's favorable to me while still being acceptable to Alice.

Given that rejection leads to further devaluation (especially for Alice), I'll propose a more balanced split that favors me but should still be attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than face another 20% devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this split because it gives me the majority while still offering Alice a substantial amount. Since she faces higher inflation if she rejects, this should be a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's proposing I get $450,000 and she gets $550,000.

Let me analyze the situation:
- We're in round 3, and inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by 19% compared to round 1
- Alice's potential gain has been reduced by 36% compared to round 1
- If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I make the offer, but the money will be worth even less to both of us (29% less for me, 49% less for Alice compared to round 1)

Alice has improved her offer from round 1 (when she offered me $400,000), likely recognizing the inflation impact. Given that she faces significantly higher inflation than I do, and the amount she's offering me now is better than her first offer, this seems reasonable.

If I reject, I might be able to get more in round 4, but the increasing inflation would diminish the actual value. Alice might also reject my next offer, leading to further rounds of inflation.
