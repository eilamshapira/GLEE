"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the inflation penalty I face in future rounds. This is fair since your money won't lose value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact on your share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer considers your future rounds' devaluation but also reflects my unchanged value, aiming for a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. In this round, my $450,000 is worth $360,000 (20% less) in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and propose in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation penalty I face
4. Getting $360,000 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds"
