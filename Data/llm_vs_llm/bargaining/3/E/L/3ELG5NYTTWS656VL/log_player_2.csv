"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000. However, the original amount is what we're dividing, so I'll make my offer based on that.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the decreased value for both of us. I'll offer a split that is reasonable, considering the decreased value.
