"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which means we each get $500,000. 

This is a fair and equal division. If I reject and move to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 20% to $800,000. Even if I managed to get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute dollar amount might be lower.

Given that this is a perfectly equitable split and considering the inflation penalty, I should accept this offer.
