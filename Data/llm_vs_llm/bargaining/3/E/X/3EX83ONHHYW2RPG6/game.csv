550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Given that I face 5% inflation with each round, this offer is actually quite reasonable. If we go to the next round, I'd need to ask for more to compensate for inflation, so this is likely the best deal for both of us.",Alice,1,
