"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the $10000 equally. We both walk away happy with $5000 each! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split where we each get $5000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to factor in inflation. Since money loses 20% of its value for me each round, waiting would reduce what I can get.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I were to ask for the full $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to 20% inflation. So accepting $5,000 now is better than potentially getting less value later.
