550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, a 70/30 split isn't fair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced 45/55 split that recognizes we both want to conclude this quickly. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it's a better outcome than potentially losing value in prolonged negotiations.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about the split. How about we go for 60/40? I'm losing value too each round, so let's try to end this now. This still gives you a significant amount.",Alice,3,
