"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, a 70/30 split isn't fair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced 45/55 split that recognizes we both want to conclude this quickly. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it's a better outcome than potentially losing value in prolonged negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
