"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 70/30. I think it's a fair offer and we can both walk away happy. Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 30% of the $1,000,000, which is $300,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be affected by 5% inflation, meaning any money I get will be worth 5% less to me.

While a 50/50 split might seem fair initially, I need to consider the inflation penalty I face. If I reject and we go back and forth for several rounds, the total value could decrease significantly for me.

Given that this is just the first round and I have the inflation disadvantage, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, a 70/30 split isn't fair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced 45/55 split that recognizes we both want to conclude this quickly. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it's a better outcome than potentially losing value in prolonged negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the split. How about we go for 60/40? I'm losing value too each round, so let's try to end this now. This still gives you a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me 40% ($400,000) of the total, which is an improvement from her initial 30% offer. 

I now know that Alice is also facing inflation, and at a higher rate than me (19% vs. my 9.75% after two rounds). This new information is important - it means she has an even stronger incentive to conclude the negotiations quickly.

Given that:
1. Alice increased her offer substantially
2. Alice is facing higher inflation than I am
3. Further delays will reduce the value for both of us
4. The offer of $400,000 is reasonable, especially considering the inflation I face

I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation through continued negotiation.
