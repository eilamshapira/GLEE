Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair to both of us. This offer considers the time pressure and potential future losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This offer is a good compromise, considering the time pressure and the fact that my share is losing value faster.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but we need to find a middle ground.  This offer accounts for the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but the deal still isn't favorable enough considering my share is devaluing faster than his.  I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to risk it for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. It's the fairest option considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. The difference in devaluation isn't significant enough at this point to warrant further risk."
