"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair and if rejecting it would be beneficial given the 5% inflation penalty per round.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round, and I'll get to make a counter-offer. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she might be more willing to accept a lower offer if she also faces inflation.

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd be offering myself $5,000, but with 5% inflation, that's equivalent to $4,750 in current value. This is better than the $4,000 I'm being offered now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me while being reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than facing inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice 45% of the total, which is more favorable to me than her initial offer while still being a reasonable compromise. Given that we both likely face inflation penalties for extending negotiations, this should be an acceptable offer that allows us both to walk away with a fair share."
