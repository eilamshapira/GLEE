"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the offer.

*   **My Value (Alice):** $50 is worth 20% less than in round 1. So, in terms of the original value, $50 in round 2 is equivalent to $50 / 1.20 = $41.67 (approximately).
*   **Bob's Value:** $50 is worth 10% less than in round 1. So, in terms of the original value, $50 in round 2 is equivalent to $50 / 1.10 = $45.45 (approximately).

Since I'm getting less value due to inflation, and the offer is split 50/50, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking another round where the value of my share will be even less.
