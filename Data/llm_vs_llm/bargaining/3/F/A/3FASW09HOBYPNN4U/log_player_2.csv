"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Alice's offer for a 50-50 split of the $10,000, I'll evaluate this carefully.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% per round), there's no direct time pressure on my decision. I'm being offered $5,000 out of the total $10,000, which is a fair equal split.

I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round hoping for more, but there's always the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer. The current proposal is fair and equitable.
