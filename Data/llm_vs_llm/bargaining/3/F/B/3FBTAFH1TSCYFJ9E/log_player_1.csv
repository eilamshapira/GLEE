"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that $4500 is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, in round 3, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value. 

For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so in round 3, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that $4000 is actually worth $4000 * (1 - 0.271) = $4000 * 0.729 = $2916 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I should consider accepting to avoid further losses.
