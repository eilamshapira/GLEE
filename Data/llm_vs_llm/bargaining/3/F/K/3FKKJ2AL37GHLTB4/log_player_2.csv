"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but it's fairly close. 

I need to consider that if I reject and we move to the next round, my purchasing power will decrease by 10% due to inflation. If I were to counter with a perfect 50/50 split ($500,000 each) in the next round, and Alice accepted, I would effectively get $500,000 Ã— 0.9 = $450,000 in present value - which is exactly what I'm being offered now.

Any better offer I might make would need to be accepted by Alice, and there's no guarantee of that. If negotiations continue to further rounds, inflation will continue to reduce my share's value.
