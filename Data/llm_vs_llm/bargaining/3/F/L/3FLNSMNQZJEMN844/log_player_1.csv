Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Bob, time is moneyâ€”literally! Every round, my share loses 10% of its value. To avoid further loss, I propose that I take $900,000 and you receive $100,000 right away. Let's settle now and both benefit from acting quickly.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation, let's find a more balanced split. I propose taking $550000 for myself and offering you $450000. This way, we both get a fair share and minimize the effects of inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
