Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is moneyâ€”literally! Every round, my share loses 10% of its value. To avoid further loss, I propose that I take $900000 and you receive $100000 right away. Let's settle now and both benefit from acting quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
