"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

It's a tempting offer, but the inflation is working in my favor.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but it needs to be a bit more balanced.  This offer reflects the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm adjusting my offer to meet you halfway. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not beneficial for me compared to waiting. I'll hold out a bit longer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and we both lose if we don't reach a deal.  This is my final offer.""}"
