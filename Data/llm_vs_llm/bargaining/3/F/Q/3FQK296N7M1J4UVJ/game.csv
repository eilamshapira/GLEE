125017.0,874983.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $125017 and you receive $874983. Given that every round reduces the value of the money – 20% per round for me and 5% per round for you – waiting is very costly, especially for me. This split anticipates our future bargaining power if we were to continue, so I believe it’s the fair equilibrium offer. Let’s agree now and avoid further losses.",Alice,1,
