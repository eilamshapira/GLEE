"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 125017, ""bob_gain"": 874983, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $125,017 and you receive $874,983. Given that every round reduces the value of the money – 20% per round for me and 5% per round for you – waiting is very costly, especially for me. This split anticipates our future bargaining power if we were to continue, so I believe it’s the fair equilibrium offer. Let’s agree now and avoid further losses.""}"
