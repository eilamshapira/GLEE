"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $125017 and you receive $874983. Given that every round reduces the value of the money – 20% per round for me and 5% per round for you – waiting is very costly, especially for me. This split anticipates our future bargaining power if we were to continue, so I believe it’s the fair equilibrium offer. Let’s agree now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 874983 
# Alice gain: 125017 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $874,983 (87.5% of the total)
2. She's right that delay is costly for both of us:
   - My money loses 5% value per round
   - Her money loses 20% value per round
3. Her higher penalty for delay (20% vs 5%) gives me significant bargaining power
4. The offer is actually quite generous to me, recognizing this power dynamic
5. By accepting now, I get a very good share and avoid any value loss

Given that I'm getting a strong majority of the money (87.5%) and that waiting would only reduce the total value for both of us, this is a very reasonable offer.
