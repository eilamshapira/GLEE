"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

While this gives me slightly more than half, it still offers Bob a very substantial portion of the money. Since Bob faces 20% depreciation per round if we don't reach an agreement, it would be in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting to make a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm adjusting my offer since Bob rejected my first proposal. This split gives Bob $40, which would be worth more to him now than waiting another round where his money would face further depreciation. With the 20% inflation factor for Bob, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I notice that Bob is still pushing for a larger share despite the increasing inflation he faces. At this point, due to the compounding 20% inflation per round, the real value of Bob's money has significantly decreased. This offer of $35 to Bob is more valuable to him now than waiting for future rounds with higher inflation, while I maintain a fair share of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Since we're now in round 7 and Bob is facing significant inflation (over 67% less value in the previous round), I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. The $30 I'm offering Bob now is worth more to him than a potentially larger amount in later rounds due to the compounding 20% inflation he faces. It's becoming increasingly important for both of us to reach an agreement before the value erodes further for Bob."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

We're now in round 9, and Bob has rejected all previous offers despite facing nearly 80% inflation in the last round. At this point, even $25 now is worth more to Bob than a larger amount in later rounds due to the severe inflation he faces. We only have a few rounds left to reach an agreement before we both get nothing, so I hope Bob will recognize the urgency of accepting a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

We're now in the penultimate round, with only one more chance after this to reach an agreement. Bob is facing extreme inflation of over 86% from the original value. At this point, $20 for Bob now is significantly better than risking no agreement in the final round. I strongly urge Bob to accept this offer, as we're both at risk of getting nothing if we can't agree by the end of round 12."
