"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for me. I want to secure a good portion early.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm asking for $6,000, leaving $4,000 for Bob. This gives me a larger initial portion to offset the inflation I'll experience in later rounds. I hope this is acceptable to Bob, considering the time constraint and potential for losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's proposing a 50/50 split. However, I need to consider the 10% inflation on my end.

Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's offer:** I get $5,000, Bob gets $5,000.
*   **Inflation:** My $5,000 is worth 10% less than it would have been in Round 1. So, it's effectively worth $5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500 in Round 1 dollars.

Given the limited rounds and the increasing inflation, accepting this offer is a reasonable choice to guarantee a portion of the money.
