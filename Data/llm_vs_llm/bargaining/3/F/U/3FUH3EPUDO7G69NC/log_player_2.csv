"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair offer for Round 1, gives you a solid starting point. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. This isn't an even split, but I should remember that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 5% each round if I reject.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the total value to me would be worth 5% less, meaning the full $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me. 

Since I'd be making the next offer, I could propose a better split for myself. However, Alice might reject, and we'd continue losing value with each round.

Given that Alice's initial offer gives me a substantial amount ($450,000) and avoids any inflation penalty, it seems reasonable to accept.
