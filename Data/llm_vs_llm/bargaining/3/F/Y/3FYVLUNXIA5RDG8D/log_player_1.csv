"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, he has more incentive to accept earlier rather than later. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a favorable majority (60%) while still leaving Bob with a significant amount
2. If Bob rejects, his next round's $400,000 would be worth only $380,000 to him due to 5% depreciation
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or trigger an emotional rejection"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000, while taking $550,000 for himself
2. For Bob, the $550,000 is actually worth $522,500 (95% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We'll use up another round (with only 10 remaining)
4. This offer isn't terrible, but I believe I can get a better deal since time pressure works in my favor

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because I can likely get a better deal in the next round, as Bob's position weakens due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth even less to him (90.25% of original value). I can use this to my advantage, but I still need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than continue further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000}

My reasoning:
1. For Bob, the $425,000 is worth about $383,562 (90.25% of original value)
2. If he rejects, any future gains will be worth even less to him
3. This offer is more favorable to me than his previous offer, but not so extreme that it should trigger an automatic rejection
4. It's a moderate improvement from my first offer, showing some willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $475,000, while taking $525,000 for himself
2. For Bob, the $525,000 is actually worth $450,135 (85.74% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 5, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less (about 81.45% of original value)
   - We'll have 8 rounds remaining
4. This offer is better than his last offer ($475,000 vs $450,000)
5. However, given the inflation pressure on Bob's side and that we still have 8 rounds, I believe I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Bob's position continues to weaken due to inflation, and we have enough rounds remaining to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're in round 5, Bob's money is now worth only 81.45% of its original value. This continues to strengthen my negotiating position. I'll increase my demands but still keep the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

My reasoning:
1. For Bob, the $400,000 is actually worth only $325,800 (81.45% of original value)
2. Each round makes Bob's position worse while mine stays the same
3. We still have 8 rounds left, but Bob should be feeling the pressure of diminishing value
4. This offer is more aggressive than my last one because:
   - Bob's previous offer showed some movement in my direction
   - The inflation effect is becoming more significant
   - We're approaching the middle rounds where decisions become more critical
   - I maintain full value while Bob loses 5% each round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $487,500, while taking $512,500 for himself
2. For Bob, the $512,500 is actually worth $396,573 (77.38% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 7, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We'll have 6 rounds remaining
4. This offer is only slightly better than his last offer ($487,500 vs $475,000)
5. Bob's incremental improvements are too small given how much value he's losing to inflation
6. We still have enough rounds to negotiate, and my position gets stronger each round

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
- The improvement from Bob's previous offer is minimal
- Bob's position continues to weaken significantly due to inflation
- We have sufficient rounds remaining to negotiate a better split
- Bob needs to make larger concessions to account for his time pressure"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 7, where Bob's money is worth only 73.51% of its original value. Bob has shown some willingness to move in my direction, but too slowly. I'll increase my demand further since time pressure on Bob is becoming quite significant.

{""alice_gain"": 625000, ""bob_gain"": 375000}

My reasoning:
1. For Bob, the $375,000 is worth only $275,662 (73.51% of original value)
2. We're now past the halfway point in rounds (7 out of 12)
3. Bob's last offer showed he's willing to move up (to giving me $487,500)
4. However, his concessions are too small given:
   - The significant inflation he's facing
   - The fact that we're running out of rounds
   - My position remains strong with no value loss
5. This offer gives him a clear signal that he needs to make larger concessions
6. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth only about 69.83% of original value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. For Bob, his $500,000 is actually worth only $349,150 (69.83% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 9, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We'll have only 4 rounds remaining
4. This offer is better than his last offer ($500,000 vs $487,500)
5. However, a 50-50 split at this late stage doesn't adequately reflect:
   - The significant inflation penalty Bob faces
   - My stronger negotiating position
   - The fact that we're in round 8 of 12

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
- Even though Bob is showing more significant movement, a 50-50 split this late in the game doesn't reflect the fundamental asymmetry in our positions
- With 4 rounds remaining and Bob's money continuing to lose value, I can still negotiate a better deal
- Bob should be feeling significant pressure to make a deal soon"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're in round 9, with Bob's money worth only 66.34% of its original value. Bob's last offer showed significant movement (to a 50-50 split), indicating he's feeling the pressure. With only 4 rounds left and his value dropping sharply, I'll push for an even better split.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

My reasoning:
1. For Bob, the $350,000 is worth only $232,190 (66.34% of original value)
2. We only have 4 rounds left, increasing pressure to make a deal
3. Bob's last offer (50-50 split) showed he's willing to make bigger concessions
4. If he rejects this:
   - His next round's money will be worth only about 63% of original value
   - We'll have just 3 rounds left
   - The risk of getting nothing increases
5. This offer reflects:
   - The severe inflation penalty Bob faces
   - The limited remaining rounds
   - My unchanged strong position
   - The need to reach agreement before we run out of time"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 512500 
# Bob gain: 487500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $512,500, with him taking $487,500
2. For Bob, his $487,500 is worth only $307,207 (63.02% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 11, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We'll have only 2 rounds remaining
4. While this offer is better than his previous one ($512,500 vs $500,000), the improvement is relatively small given:
   - The severe inflation he's facing
   - Only 2 rounds remaining after this
   - Risk of both getting nothing if we don't agree

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
- The improvement from the last offer is too small given the time pressure
- With only 2 rounds remaining after this, Bob needs to make larger concessions
- His money will be worth even less next round, strengthening my position further
- The risk of getting nothing should motivate Bob to make a better offer soon"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 11 - the second to last round. This is a critical moment. Bob's money is worth only 59.87% of its original value, and we have just one round left after this. The risk of both getting nothing is very real.

{""alice_gain"": 625000, ""bob_gain"": 375000}

My reasoning:
1. I'm slightly reducing my demands from my last offer (650k/350k to 625k/375k) because:
   - We're dangerously close to both getting nothing
   - Bob has shown some willingness to move (now offering me 512.5k)
   - This offer still gives me a significant advantage
2. For Bob, the $375,000 is worth only $224,512 (59.87% of original value)
3. Key considerations:
   - Only one round remains after this
   - Bob faces severe inflation
   - We both face the risk of getting nothing
4. This offer represents a reasonable compromise that:
   - Maintains my strong position
   - Shows some flexibility from my side
   - Gives Bob a better deal than my last offer
   - Should be more attractive than risking everything in the final round"
