"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60/40 split in her favor, which would give me $4,000. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

If I reject and we go to another round, the total amount will effectively be worth 5% less to me. So instead of dividing $10,000, we'd be dividing $9,500 from my perspective. Even if I could get 50% in the next round, that would be $4,750, which is only $750 more than Alice's current offer.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that $4,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
