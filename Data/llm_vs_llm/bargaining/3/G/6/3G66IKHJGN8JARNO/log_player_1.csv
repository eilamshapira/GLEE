"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer to Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split which seems fair to both of us. Since there's no inflation affecting me, and I'm not sure how inflation affects you, a 50-50 split right now might be the most mutually beneficial option.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe I deserve a bit more because of the inflation impact on me. How about I take $55 and you take $45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you. I'm willing to give you a bit more than an equal split to account for that, but I can't go as low as $45 for myself. Let's settle at $52 for me and $48 for you - this acknowledges your inflation concern while still being fair to both of us.""}"
