"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split which seems fair to both of us. Since there's no inflation affecting me, and I'm not sure how inflation affects you, a 50-50 split right now might be the most mutually beneficial option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,""alice_gain"": 45,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe I deserve a bit more because of the inflation impact on me. How about I take $55 and you take $45?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you. I'm willing to give you a bit more than an equal split to account for that, but I can't go as low as $45 for myself. Let's settle at $52 for me and $48 for you - this acknowledges your inflation concern while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
