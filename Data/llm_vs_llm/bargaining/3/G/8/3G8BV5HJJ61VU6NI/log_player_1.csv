Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split. I believe we can both benefit from this arrangement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Let's not drag this out through multiple rounds since inflation will reduce the value for me with each passing round. This even split maximizes our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
