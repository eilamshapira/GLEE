"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I believe we can both benefit from this arrangement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which isn't an equal split. With inflation reducing my value by 10% each round, I need to weigh whether to accept now or risk making a counter-offer.

If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd potentially aim for a more favorable split, but the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. 

Let me reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Let's not drag this out through multiple rounds since inflation will reduce the value for me with each passing round. This even split maximizes our combined value.""}"
