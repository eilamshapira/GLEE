"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with me taking $60 and you taking $40. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40, which is a bit less than an equal split. Since I'll get to make a counter-offer if I reject, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. However, Alice might then reject my offer, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that risks both of us getting nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being diplomatic about it.

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest outcome for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the deal.""
