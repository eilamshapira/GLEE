5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose an even split of 5000 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, and it helps us avoid losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to different inflation rates, a 50-50 split isn't actually fair. I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. I propose a 58-42 split which better accounts for our different inflation rates. This is more equitable than it appears.",Alice,3,
