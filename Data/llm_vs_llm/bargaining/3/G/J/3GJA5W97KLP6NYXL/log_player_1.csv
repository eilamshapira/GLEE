"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (10%) each round. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split of 5000 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, and it helps us avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Since I lose 20% per round vs Bob's 10%, an even split becomes less favorable for me over time. My $5000 is now worth $4000 due to 20% inflation, while Bob's $5000 is worth $4500 due to 10% inflation. I should try to negotiate for a better split to account for my higher inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to different inflation rates, a 50-50 split isn't actually fair. I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. I propose a 58-42 split which better accounts for our different inflation rates. This is more equitable than it appears.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I get 4500 and you get 5500. This reflects the inflation differences while still being generous. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. The inflation is getting significant (I've lost 48.8% of value)
2. My $5500 is now worth about $2816 after inflation
3. Further delays will reduce the real value even more
4. This is a reasonable compromise considering our different inflation rates
5. The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 is increasing"
