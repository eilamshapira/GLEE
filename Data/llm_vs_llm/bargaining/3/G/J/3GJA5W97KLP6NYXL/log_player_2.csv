"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (10%) each round. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,""alice_gain"": 5000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an even split of 5000 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, and it helps us avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to different inflation rates, a 50-50 split isn't actually fair. I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. I propose a 58-42 split which better accounts for our different inflation rates. This is more equitable than it appears. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500,""alice_gain"": 5500,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I get 4500 and you get 5500. This reflects the inflation differences while still being generous.""}"
