"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
* $4000 now vs potentially more but worth less later...

Given that inflation will reduce any future amount by 10%, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me, I'll accept this offer.
