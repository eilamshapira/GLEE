"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. Given that the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, I need to consider if rejecting is worth it.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced to $9,500 (95% of $10,000). Even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, I need to weigh that against the 5% loss.

$4,000 is a substantial portion of the money. If I reject, I risk getting less due to inflation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer.
