"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, being mindful of the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I face a 10% inflation penalty with each round. This gives you a substantial share while acknowledging that delays would hurt my position more than yours."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
