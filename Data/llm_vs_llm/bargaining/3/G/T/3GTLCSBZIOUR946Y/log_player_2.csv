"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

Given that:
1. This is just the first round out of 12 possible rounds
2. The money doesn't lose value for me over time (0% inflation)
3. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. The split isn't terribly unfair, but I could probably get a better deal

I believe I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer in the next round. While $400,000 is a substantial amount, since there's no inflation penalty for me and plenty of rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable but more favorable offer. I'll propose a more equitable split while still giving Alice a good incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Alice might accept it. If she rejects, we still have 10 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not affected by inflation."
