"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50. It's fair and simple. Inflation affects us both, so let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. With 10% inflation for me, $500,000 now is worth $450,000 in terms of round 1 value
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. Bob's offer is quite fair, and continuing the game would likely lead to diminishing returns for both of us
4. There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer from me in the next round"
