"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $45. It's a good deal for both of us considering the looming inflation! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Current Round:** 1
*   **Alice's offer:** $45 for Bob, $55 for Alice.
*   **Inflation:** Money is worth 5% less for me each round. Money is worth 20% less for Alice each round.
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 12

If I reject this offer, I'll be proposing in the next round, but the value of the money will decrease. Alice's offer gives me $45 *now*. If I reject, I need to propose something that gives me more than the equivalent of $45 after the 5% inflation.

Let's consider the worst-case scenario. If I reject every offer, I'll get nothing. So, $45 now is better than nothing.

While a ""fair split"" would be $50, I'm losing value to inflation each round, and Alice is losing even more to inflation. Getting $45 upfront seems reasonable. Let's accept.
