"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. Due to 20% inflation per round, this $500,000 will be worth $400,000 to me in the next round
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which creates some uncertainty
5. We have 12 rounds total, but prolonging too much could leave us both with nothing

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and the risk of value loss due to inflation, I'll accept.
