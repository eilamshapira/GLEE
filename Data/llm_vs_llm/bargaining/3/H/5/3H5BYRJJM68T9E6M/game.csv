6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, if we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation concern.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but I also have inflation concerns of my own. Let's do a 60/40 split in *my* favor this round. We both need to be reasonable to avoid losing out completely. I am facing 10% inflation each round.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but my inflation rate is higher at 20% per round while yours is only 10%. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This acknowledges both our inflation concerns while being fair. If we continue too long, we'll both lose significantly due to inflation. This is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,
