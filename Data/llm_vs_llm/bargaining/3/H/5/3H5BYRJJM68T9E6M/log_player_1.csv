"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, if we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation concern.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but I also have inflation concerns of my own. Let's do a 60/40 split in *my* favor this round. We both need to be reasonable to avoid losing out completely. I am facing 10% inflation each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but my inflation rate is higher at 20% per round while yours is only 10%. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This acknowledges both our inflation concerns while being fair. If we continue too long, we'll both lose significantly due to inflation. This is a reasonable compromise.""}"
