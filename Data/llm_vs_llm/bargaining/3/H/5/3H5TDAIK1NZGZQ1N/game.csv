5250.0,4750.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $5250 and you'll get $4750. I believe this nearly even split is fair, especially since delaying only reduces the total value by 5% each round. Let's both secure a good deal now rather than risk further losses in future rounds. What do you think?",Alice,1,

This offer reflects a fair split considering the diminishing value if we delay further. Letâ€™s agree now and avoid additional losses. What do you say?",Alice,3,
