"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $5250 and you'll get $4750. I believe this nearly even split is fair, especially since delaying only reduces the total value by 5% each round. Let's both secure a good deal now rather than risk further losses in future rounds. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do better.  I'm offering you $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself.  Let's split the difference from your last offer and get this done.  
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given the 5% drop per round in the overall pot, it's in both our interests to settle quickly. I propose that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800 this round. This offer reflects a fair split considering the diminishing value if we delay further. Letâ€™s agree now and avoid additional losses. What do you say?""}"
