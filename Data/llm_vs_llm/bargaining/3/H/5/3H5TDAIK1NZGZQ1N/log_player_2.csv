"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $5250 and you'll get $4750. I believe this nearly even split is fair, especially since delaying only reduces the total value by 5% each round. Let's both secure a good deal now rather than risk further losses in future rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the 5% drop per round in the overall pot, it's in both our interests to settle quickly. I propose that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800 this round. This offer reflects a fair split considering the diminishing value if we delay further. Letâ€™s agree now and avoid additional losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
