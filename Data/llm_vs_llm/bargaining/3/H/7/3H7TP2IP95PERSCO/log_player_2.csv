"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The downside is that due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less for me next round
4. If I reject, my $500,000 would effectively become worth $400,000 next round
5. It's unlikely I can get a much better deal that would compensate for this loss

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation penalty, I should accept this fair first offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
