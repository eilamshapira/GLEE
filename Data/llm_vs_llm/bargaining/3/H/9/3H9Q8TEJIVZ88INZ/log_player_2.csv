"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. 

Alice is proposing a 50/50 split where both of us get $5,000. This is generally considered a fair division.

However, I should consider the fact that inflation affects Alice but not me. If we go to the next round:
- For me, the money will still be worth the full value
- For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less

This gives me some negotiation leverage. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might be willing to accept less than 50% to avoid further devaluation of her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation factor affecting Alice.

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I face 0%, she has incentive to reach an agreement sooner. A rational approach would be to offer slightly better than what Alice would get in the next round if she rejects my offer.

If Alice rejects my offer and we go to round 3, her money would be worth 20% less. So I'll propose a division that gives her slightly more than she would get if we continued to the next round, while still improving my position compared to the initial 50/50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer acknowledges the time pressure on Alice while still being reasonable. It's not so aggressive that she would reject it out of principle, but it does capitalize on the structural advantage I have in this negotiation."
