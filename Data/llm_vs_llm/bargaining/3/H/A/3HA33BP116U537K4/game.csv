5000.0,5000.0,Split it down the middle; fairness considering devaluation,Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate the notion of fairness, but the current proposal gives me an effective value of roughly $4512 (in round‑1 dollars), while my future bargaining position—given my relatively lower discounting—offers me a better prospect if we continue. I’m willing to hold out for a revised proposal that reflects that advantage.",Bob,3,reject
1667.0,8333.0,"Alice, I know we’ve both suffered from the inflationary squeeze. Given that if you reject now you'll get to propose in the next round—but with your money devalued even further—the best we can do is stick with the equilibrium split. By accepting this offer, you secure exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited. Let’s end this game on a fair note now.",Bob,4,
