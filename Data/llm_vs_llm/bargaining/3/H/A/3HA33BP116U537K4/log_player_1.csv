"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject, you'll propose in Round 3 but with further devaluation (your money will drop by 20% again). This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect to secure in equilibrium if you waited. I believe it’s in both our best interests to agree now. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant devaluation of my potential gain with each round and Bob's argument about securing what I'd expect in equilibrium, I'll make a decision based on the current offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that my potential gain devalues by 20% each round, and it has already devalued once in Round 1 and again in Round 2, I need to make a competitive offer to Bob while considering the devaluation.

In Round 1, the total value was $10,000.
In Round 2, my share would be worth 80% of its original value, and in Round 3, it would be worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80%).
For Bob, the value deprecates by 5% each round, so in Round 3, the value for him would be 95% * 95% = 90.25% of the original.

Considering these devaluations, I'll aim for a split that reflects a balance between our devaluing potentials.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it down the middle; fairness considering devaluation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we’ve both suffered from the inflationary squeeze. Given that if you reject now you'll get to propose in the next round—but with your money devalued even further—the best we can do is stick with the equilibrium split. By accepting this offer, you secure exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited. Let’s end this game on a fair note now. 
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant devaluation of my potential gain (48.8% less than in Round 1) and considering Bob's offer, which seems to mirror the equilibrium split he mentioned earlier, I must weigh my options carefully.

Accepting this offer would give me $1667, which, although devalued, is a guaranteed amount. Rejecting it would lead to another round with even further devaluation of my potential gain, which could result in an even lower amount.

Considering the devaluation and the potential risks of further negotiation, I decide to accept the offer to secure a known amount rather than risking further loss.
