Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8333, ""alice_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject, you'll propose in Round 3 but with further devaluation (your money will drop by 20% again). This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect to secure in equilibrium if you waited. I believe it’s in both our best interests to agree now. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle; fairness considering devaluation 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the notion of fairness, but the current proposal gives me an effective value of roughly $4,512 (in round‑1 dollars), while my future bargaining position—given my relatively lower discounting—offers me a better prospect if we continue. I’m willing to hold out for a revised proposal that reflects that advantage.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8333, ""alice_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we’ve both suffered from the inflationary squeeze. Given that if you reject now you'll get to propose in the next round—but with your money devalued even further—the best we can do is stick with the equilibrium split. By accepting this offer, you secure exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited. Let’s end this game on a fair note now.""}"
