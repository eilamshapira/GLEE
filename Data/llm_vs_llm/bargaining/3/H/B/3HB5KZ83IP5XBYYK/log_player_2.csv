"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is generally considered equitable. If I reject, I could propose a higher amount for myself in the next round, but:

1. The money will be worth 5% less (only $95 total to split)
2. Alice could then reject my offer, leading to even more depreciation
3. The even split shows good faith from Alice

Given these factors, accepting the 50-50 split now is the most rational choice.
