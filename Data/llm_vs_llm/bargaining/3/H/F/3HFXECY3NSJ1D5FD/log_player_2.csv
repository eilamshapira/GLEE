"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a $4000/$6000 split, meaning I get 40% of the total
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money is worth 20% less to me
   - $4000 now > $4800 in next round after 20% inflation ($3840 effective value)

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. Getting $4000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with reduced value.
