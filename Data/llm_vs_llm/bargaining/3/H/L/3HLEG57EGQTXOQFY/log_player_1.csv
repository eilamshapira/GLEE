"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that gives us both a good outcome, and it makes sense to agree early before inflation erodes the value."
