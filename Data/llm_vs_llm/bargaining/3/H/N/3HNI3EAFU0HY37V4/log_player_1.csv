"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. This strategy aims to minimize the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my demand slightly but still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping that he'll realize the potential losses due to inflation and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings. Although I'm not thrilled with this offer, accepting it ensures I get something instead of nothing."
