"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of this alternating‐offer bargaining game (with 12 rounds and the discounting rules where, in every new round, money loses 10% of its value for you and 20% for Bob), one can “solve” for the subgame‐perfect equilibrium.

Briefly, here is the outline of the reasoning:

1. In the final (12th) round Bob is the proposer. Since if Bob’s offer is rejected both end up with nothing, he can propose to give Alice an arbitrarily small (almost zero) amount and keep nearly all $10,000 for himself. (Alice would reject only if offered less than what she’d get by rejecting; but in round 12 rejection yields zero.)

2. Stepping backward to round 11 (where you, Alice, propose), you must offer Bob exactly what he would get if he rejected and became proposer in round 12 – after taking into account that the “value‐loss” in round 12 means Bob’s money will be worth only 80% of a nominal dollar. (In round 11 no discount applies to Bob’s share immediately, but his “outside option” in round 12 is discounted by 20%.) This analysis works out so that in round 11 you’d keep nominally $2,000 and offer Bob $8,000.

3. Continuing in this manner, one “peels back” the game to round 1. (In each round the proposer just barely “beats” the responder’s continuation value—when expressed in nominal dollars—by accounting for the different discount factors: you lose 10% per round and Bob loses 20% per round.)

4. After working through these backwards calculations (the details involve matching, in each round, the responder’s utility now with the utility they would get later if they rejected the current offer), one finds that in round 1 your equilibrium offer is to keep approximately $6,147.76 and to offer Bob about $3,852.24.

Thus, as Alice in round 1, you can propose the following division:

{""alice_gain"": 6147.76, ""bob_gain"": 3852.24}

For simplicity you might round these numbers to whole dollars if you prefer:

{""alice_gain"": 6148, ""bob_gain"": 3852}

Either way, this is the offer that balances Bob’s incentive to accept now versus waiting for his own proposal in round 2 (when his share will be discounted).

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on the discounting rules and our backward‐induction reasoning, here’s the key idea:

• In Round 2 Bob’s offer gives you 5,000 in nominal dollars. However, because by Round 2 your money is worth only 90% of its original value, accepting would net you the equivalent of 0.9 × 5,000 = 4,500 in round‐1 terms.

• If you reject, you become the proposer in Round 3. Even though further delay implies another round of discounting (making each dollar worth only 0.9² = 0.81 of its initial value for you), as the proposer you can design an offer that barely gives Bob his continuation value while capturing a larger share for yourself. Under equilibrium reasoning, your expected payoff (when translated back into round‐1 equivalents) would exceed the 4,500 you’d get by accepting Bob’s offer.

Thus, it is rational for you to reject the 5,000–5,000 offer from Bob in Round 2.

Answer:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Below is one way to “solve” the game by working backward from later rounds. (There are many details in a full backward‐induction analysis of an alternating offer game with different per‐round discount factors. The numbers below are meant to illustrate one equilibrium calculation.) 

Recall the rules: In every round the $10,000 “pie” is the same in nominal terms. However, if an offer is accepted in round n then for you (Alice) each dollar you receive is worth 0.9^(n–1) of its round‑1 value and for Bob each dollar is worth 0.8^(n–1) of its round‑1 value. In addition, if an offer is rejected the game continues (with a new, re–divisible $10,000, though “discounted” by one round for each player).

A brief sketch of the backward‐induction steps (working from the final round, round 12, back to round 3) is as follows. (All “nominal” amounts below are in dollars.) 

• In round 12 Bob is the proposer. Since there is no later round, he can “keep” nearly all of the money. (Alice would be willing to accept any positive amount, because her alternative is nothing.) 

• In round 11 you (Alice) would be the proposer. To induce Bob to accept right away, you must give him exactly what he would get by waiting until round 12. In round 12 Bob would get almost 10,000 nominal, but its value from Bob’s perspective would be multiplied by 0.8^(11). In round 11 an accepted offer is valued with Bob’s factor 0.8^(10). In effect, the “transfer” amounts work out so that in round 11 an equilibrium offer (ignoring an arbitrarily small epsilon) would be roughly: 
  Alice: 2,000 and Bob: 8,000. 

• In round 10 Bob would be the proposer. Working similarly, one can show that equilibrium reasoning yields an offer of approximately: 
  Alice: 1,800 and Bob: 8,200. 

• In round 9 when you are the proposer, a similar argument gives an offer roughly: 
  Alice: 3,440 and Bob: 6,560. 

• In round 8 with Bob proposing, the equilibrium offer becomes approximately: 
  Alice: 3,096 and Bob: 6,904. 

• In round 7 with you proposing, the equilibrium offer becomes approximately: 
  Alice: 4,476.80 and Bob: 5,523.20. 

• In round 6 Bob (as proposer) would then offer approximately: 
  Alice: 4,029.12 and Bob: 5,970.88. 

• In round 5 with you proposing, the equilibrium offer becomes approximately: 
  Alice: 5,223.30 and Bob: 4,776.70. 

• In round 4 with Bob proposing, the equilibrium offer becomes approximately: 
  Alice: 4,700.97 and Bob: 5,299.03. 

Now we are in round 3 (your turn as proposer). In round 3 the “immediate‐value multipliers” are:
  • For you: 0.9^(3–1) = 0.9² = 0.81.
  • For Bob: 0.8² = 0.64.
If Bob rejects your round‑3 offer, then in round 4 (with Bob proposing) he expects, in nominal terms, to obtain about 5,299.03 dollars. But notice that in round 4 Bob’s money is worth only 0.8^(3) = 0.512 of its round‑1 value. In order to make Bob indifferent between accepting now and waiting one more round, your offer in round 3 must satisfy that, when valued at Bob’s round‑3 multiplier (0.64), it equals Bob’s continuation value if he rejects. In other words, if you offer Bob an amount X (nominal dollars) in round 3, then Bob obtains:
  X × 0.64  (if he accepts in round 3),
while if he rejects he expects (from the round‑4 outcome) an effective nominal value of about 
  5,299.03 × 0.8 = 4,239.22  (nominal dollars “translated” into the round‑3 perspective).

Thus, setting
  X × 0.64 = 4,239.22    implies  X = 4,239.22 / 0.64 ≈ 6,623.16.
But note that this “X” would be Bob’s payoff conversion if we were directly equating the discounted values; another common method is to note that when moving from round 3 to round 4, Bob’s nominal amount is “shrunk” by a factor of 0.8. Accordingly, if he expects 5,299.03 in round 4, then his equivalent nominal requirement in round 3 is roughly 5,299.03 × 0.8 = 4,239.22. 

That is, in round 3 you must offer Bob an amount (nominal dollars) that, when “adjusted” from round 4 to round 3, gives him about 4,239.22; in other words, Bob’s required amount in round 3 is about 4,239.22 dollars.

Then your share in round 3 is 10,000 − 4,239.22 = 5,760.78 (nominal dollars).

Thus an equilibrium offer you can send in round 3 is:

{""alice_gain"": 5760.78, ""bob_gain"": 4239.22}

Keep in mind that details of discounting (and whether we use an “epsilon” adjustment) can shift the exact numbers slightly, but this offer is consistent with the logic that Bob should be just indifferent between accepting now versus waiting (with his greater discounting in later rounds).
