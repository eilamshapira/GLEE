"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3852.24 
# Alice gain: 6147.76 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money after the first round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I should try to get the best deal as early as possible.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $3852.24 and her $6147.76, I should calculate what I would get if I were to propose in the next round, considering the devaluation.

However, since this is the first round and I don't have a basis for comparison yet, and given that the devaluation significantly affects my potential earnings in subsequent rounds, I should consider whether Alice's offer is reasonable enough to accept now, avoiding further devaluation.

Considering the significant difference in devaluation rates (20% for me vs. 10% for Alice), it might be beneficial to accept an offer that seems somewhat reasonable now rather than risking a lower amount later.

Given these considerations, my response to Alice's offer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the devaluation rates, I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Alice to accept but also favorable to me, given the higher devaluation rate I'm facing.

For the first round, the total value of the money is $10,000. Since Alice's money devalues at 10% per round, and we are now in the second round, the value for her would be $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000 if she were to receive it now. For me, the value devalues at 20%, so the value would be $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000 if I were to receive it now.

However, these calculations are for understanding the devaluation impact. The actual division should consider making a fair and attractive offer. Given that I need to make an offer that Alice might accept, and knowing that the money's value decreases, I'll aim for a division that reflects a bit of generosity but also accounts for my higher devaluation rate.

Let's propose a 50/50 split as a starting point for simplicity, but considering I need to incentivize Alice to accept due to her lower devaluation rate, I might lean slightly in her favor or make it exactly even to encourage acceptance.

My offer for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4239.22 
# Alice gain: 5760.78 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer and now it's her turn again, I need to evaluate her new proposal carefully, considering the devaluation of the money.

The money I would gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, which means if I were to get $10,000, its value to me would be $10,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $6,400. For Alice, the money is worth 19% less, so $10,000 * (1 - 0.19) = $8,100.

Alice's offer gives me $4,239.22 and her $5,760.78. To decide, I should compare this to what I could potentially get in the next round, considering the continued devaluation.

However, given the significant devaluation I'm facing (36% already), and the fact that this devaluation will continue to increase with each round, I should prioritize accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount now rather than risking even less in subsequent rounds.

Considering Alice's offer and the devaluation, I calculate the value of her offer to me, taking into account the 36% devaluation: $4,239.22 is the amount I'd get, but its value to me, considering the devaluation, would be less. However, since this is a direct offer and not a percentage of the total, I should consider whether this amount is sufficient given the circumstances.

Given the rejection of my previous offer and the significant devaluation I'm experiencing, I should consider whether fighting for a potentially better deal in subsequent rounds is worth the risk of getting even less due to devaluation.

My decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
