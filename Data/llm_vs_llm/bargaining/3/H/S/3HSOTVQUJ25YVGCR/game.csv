,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"I propose an equal split of 50-50. This is completely fair, and considering you face 5% inflation per round, this deal is better for you now than waiting for future rounds.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,Meet in the middle of my first offer and your equal split,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, due to the 5% inflation per round that affects you, waiting longer will only decrease the value of your share. This offer of 45% is actually worth more to you now than a higher percentage later. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value to inflation.",Bob,4,

56.0,44.0,"Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer share",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, we're now halfway through our negotiation rounds, and the inflation effect on your share is getting more significant. At this point, accepting 47% is better for you than waiting longer, as your money will be worth even less in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",Bob,6,
