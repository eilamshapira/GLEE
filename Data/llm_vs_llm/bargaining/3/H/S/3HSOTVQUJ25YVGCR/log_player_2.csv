"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $40 while she gets $60.

Given the inflation details, I should consider:
- For me, there's 0% inflation per round, so money value doesn't change
- For Alice, there's 5% inflation per round, so her money loses value each round

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice might be more willing to accept a more favorable split for me since she faces inflation. If I wait, I could potentially get more than $40.

Since this is just the first round and I have the advantage regarding inflation, I'll reject this offer and propose my own in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation Alice faces while still being reasonable for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an equal split of 50-50. This is completely fair, and considering you face 5% inflation per round, this deal is better for you now than waiting for future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your equal split 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $42 while she takes $58.

The inflation context:
- For me: 0% inflation, so my money retains full value
- For Alice: Now at 9.75% inflation from round 1, meaning her $58 is effectively worth only about $52.35 to her

This is still below an equal split from my perspective, and the inflation disadvantage for Alice continues to grow. As we move to round 4, her inflation will increase further, giving me more leverage.

Since I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to be patient and push for a better deal in the next round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, due to the 5% inflation per round that affects you, waiting longer will only decrease the value of your share. This offer of 45% is actually worth more to you now than a higher percentage later. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $44 while she takes $56.

The inflation context:
- For me: 0% inflation, so my $44 retains full value
- For Alice: Now at 18.55% inflation from round 1, meaning her $56 is effectively worth only about $45.61 to her

We're now at round 5 of 12, and Alice's inflation penalty is becoming more significant. Her effective value is approaching a near-equal split, though I still have a slight disadvantage from my perspective.

Given that we have 7 more potential rounds and Alice's inflation will continue to increase (making her more likely to accept a better offer for me later), I'll reject this offer to seek a more favorable split in the next round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, 
""alice_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""Alice, we're now halfway through our negotiation rounds, and the inflation effect on your share is getting more significant. At this point, accepting 47% is better for you than waiting longer, as your money will be worth even less in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
