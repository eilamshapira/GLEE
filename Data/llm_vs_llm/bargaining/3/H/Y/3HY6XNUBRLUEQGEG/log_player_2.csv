"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a good amount right now without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider the immediate payout versus potential future rounds affected by inflation.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, the money will be worth 20% less to me then, meaning the effective value of the $10,000 drops to $8,000 for me. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 now, which is less than an even split but still substantial. If I reject and aim for more in the next round, I would need to secure over $5,625 ($4,500 รท 0.8) just to break even with what I'm being offered now, due to the 20% inflation penalty.

Given this inflation pressure and the reasonable initial offer, I'll accept.
