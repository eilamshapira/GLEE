"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept given the inflation penalty he faces.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while giving me a small advantage. I think it's reasonable since Bob faces a 5% penalty per round if he declines, while I don't face any inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $5250, which is slightly less than my initial proposal of $5500
2. His share would be $4750, but it's worth 5% less to him due to inflation
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less in the next round
4. The offer is fairly reasonable, and prolonging the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's a fair split and the difference from my initial proposal isn't large enough to risk further rounds of negotiation."
