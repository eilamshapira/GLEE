"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself, calling it a ""fair share."" Given that I'm facing a 20% reduction in value each round if I reject, I need to consider this carefully.

If I reject and propose in round 2, even if I propose a 50/50 split, my $50 would only be worth $40 to me due to the 20% inflation penalty. If Alice rejects and we go to round 3, it gets even worse for me.

While Alice's offer isn't exactly equal, the $40 now is equivalent to what I'd effectively get from a 50/50 split in the next round, and there's risk in continuing.
