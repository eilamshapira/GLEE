"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation rates for both of us.

Given that inflation reduces the value by 5% for me and 20% for Bob each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, Bob has a stronger incentive to agree quickly because his inflation rate is higher.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging the asymmetric inflation rates. Since Bob loses value much faster than I do if we continue negotiating, this should be an attractive offer for him to accept immediately."
