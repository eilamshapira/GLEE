"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000 total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me). For Alice, it would only be worth 5% less.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face (20% vs Alice's 5%), accepting a 40/60 split now may be better than risking a counter-offer that Alice might reject, leaving me with even less value in subsequent rounds.
