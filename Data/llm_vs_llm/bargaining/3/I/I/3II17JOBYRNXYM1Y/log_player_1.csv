"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects us differently.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing slightly more than a 50/50 split, prioritizing my gain a bit. I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer. I will wait for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will consider this offer.

*   **My perspective:** My money is worth 10% less than before. So, $5000 now is equivalent to $5000 / 0.9 = $5555.56 in round 1 dollars (for me).

*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob's money is worth 5% less than before. So $5000 now is equivalent to $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16 in round 1 dollars (for Bob).

While it's a seemingly even split, I need to consider the inflation. 5000 for me after 10% depreciation is good.
