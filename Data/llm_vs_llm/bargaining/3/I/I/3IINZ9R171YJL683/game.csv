55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that reflects the inflation factor. Since the money loses 5% value for me each round, I need to account for that. If we go to the final round, I'd need a higher percentage just to break even. Let's save time and agree to this reasonable 55/45 split now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 60/40 split would be a better reflection of our stakes. Let's agree on this and avoid risking losing everything!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation penalty affects only me, reducing my value by 5% each round. A fair split would account for this disadvantage. Your 40/60 split was heavily in your favor. I'm proposing 58/42 now, which is reasonable given my inflation disadvantage. Let's agree and end this efficiently.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your perspective on the inflation issue, but I still feel that a 65/35 split is more beneficial for both of us. It ensures I receive a fair amount while still giving you something. Let's end this now!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I notice you're increasing your demands with each round, which is concerning. The inflation is now at 19%, meaning any delay significantly hurts my position. A 60/40 split accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. This is a fair compromise considering we're almost halfway through our rounds. Let's agree and avoid risking everything.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your position regarding inflation, but to make this work, I believe a 70/30 split benefits me while still providing you with a decent amount. Let's finalize this and avoid future risk!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I notice you're consistently increasing your demands while ignoring the inflation that only affects me. At this point (round 7), inflation has reduced my value by over 26%. This means I need at least 65% just to receive approximately 48% of the original value. You keep asking for more while my position weakens. This is my final fair offer considering the significant disadvantage I face. If we continue, we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 75/25 split is the best offer I can make at this point. It ensures I get a reasonable share while still allowing you to receive something. Let's close this out!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, we're now in round 9 with only a few rounds left. The inflation has reduced my value by 34%, which means I need 70% just to get about 46% of the original value. Your demands keep increasing while ignoring this reality. If we reach round 12, we both get nothing. This 70/30 split is actually fair considering the circumstances - I'm effectively getting less than half of the original value. Let's end this now before we both lose everything.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
20.0,80.0,"Hi Alice, we are running out of time, and I think an 80/20 split would be the last fair offer I can make. It allows me to secure a decent amount while still providing you something. Let's finalize this before itâ€™s too late!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. At this point, the inflation has reduced my value by almost 41%. If you reject this offer, we go to the final round where I'll need to ask for even more just to get a fair value, or we both risk getting NOTHING. With a 75/25 split, I'm effectively getting only about 44% of the original value due to inflation. This is my final reasonable offer that accounts for the inflation disadvantage. If you reject this, we're both likely to walk away with nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
0.0,100.0,"Hi Alice, since this is the final round, I must go for the full amount. I understand the game dynamics have been tough, but I believe I have to secure my stake. I hope you understand.",Bob,12,
