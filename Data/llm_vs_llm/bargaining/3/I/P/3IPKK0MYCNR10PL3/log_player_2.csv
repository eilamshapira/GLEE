"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer does give me $40, I should consider the inflation as we progress through rounds. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will already be reduced. Since I face higher inflation (20% per round) than Alice (10% per round), delaying is more costly for me.

Let me analyze this: $40 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in later rounds when it's worth less due to my higher inflation rate. If I reject, I'll make the next offer but we'll already have lost some value.
