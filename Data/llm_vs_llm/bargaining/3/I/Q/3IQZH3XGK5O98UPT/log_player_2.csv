"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value of the money was $10,000. 
For me, it's now worth $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.
For Alice, it's now worth $10,000 * 0.80 = $8,000.

I'll make an offer based on the original $10,000 amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still open to negotiation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, 
for me, the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $10,000 * 0.857375 = $8,573.75 (approximately).
For Alice, it's now worth $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $10,000 * 0.512 = $5,120.

I'll make an offer based on the original $10,000 amount.
