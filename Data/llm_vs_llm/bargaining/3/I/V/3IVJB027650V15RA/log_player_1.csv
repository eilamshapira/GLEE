"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given our equal positions in this negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and equal, considering the impact of inflation, it's better to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $50, which is less than my initial proposal of $60
2. Bob's gain has been affected by 20% inflation, so his $50 is actually worth $40 to him
3. My $50 is worth the full amount since inflation doesn't affect me
4. If I reject, we'll go to another round, but I don't know how much inflation will affect Bob in the next round
5. This might be a good time to accept since I'm getting a fair amount and Bob is already experiencing significant inflation
