"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's resolve this quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of $50 each. This way, we both come out with a fair share quickly without worrying about inflation affecting your portion. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is because:
1. With 10% inflation per round, my $50 is worth $45 in real value
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
3. Even if I proposed a higher split for myself in the next round, Bob might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a fair share while avoiding the risk of further value loss"
