"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, keeping in mind the dwindling time and the potential for no payout at all:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering a more favorable split for myself, recognizing the pressure of the game and the risk of further devaluation."
