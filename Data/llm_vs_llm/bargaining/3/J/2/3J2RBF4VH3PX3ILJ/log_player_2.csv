"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly better share for me in exchange for a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
3. In the next round, even if I get a larger nominal amount, it would be worth less
4. If I want to beat this offer in the next round:
   * I'd need to get more than $473,684 to compensate for the 5% inflation
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The offer is reasonable, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting now more attractive.
