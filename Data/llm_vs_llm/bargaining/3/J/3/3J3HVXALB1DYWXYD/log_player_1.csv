Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, and this is the third round, the total value of the money Bob would receive is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. 

To take this into account, I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more, but still tries to be reasonable.
