"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Accept my offer, Alice, as we both get a decent amount! With inflation affecting me more with each round, I'd rather we settle this quickly. Consider this offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
