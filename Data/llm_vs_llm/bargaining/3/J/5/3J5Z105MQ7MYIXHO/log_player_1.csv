"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation, I should make a strategic first offer. Bob needs to weigh accepting now versus making a counter-offer that will be worth less to him. I'll propose a somewhat favorable split for myself but not too aggressive to risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this division where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. Since Bob faces 20% depreciation per round, he should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than waiting for future rounds where his share would be worth less to him."
