Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair division, and with inflation eating away at the value, it's best to secure a good portion now.  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round for me, getting $5000 now (worth $4500 after the 10% inflation from round 1) is better than risking further rounds where the money will be worth even less. Additionally, a 50-50 split is fundamentally fair, and continuing to negotiate could lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
