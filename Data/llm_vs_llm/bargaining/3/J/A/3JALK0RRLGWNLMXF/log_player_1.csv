"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must calculate the real value of the money considering the inflation.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 20% less. So, $350,000 is now worth $350,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $280,000 in terms of the value for the first round.

Considering the value for the first round, the total money is worth $1,000,000.

I also need to consider that I have 11 rounds to go.

Therefore, I **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation I've experienced (20% reduction in value compared to Round 1). I'll also consider the decreasing value of the money and the fact that I have fewer rounds left.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money, considering the accumulated inflation.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1.  So, $300,000 is now worth $300,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $151,600 in terms of Round 1 value.

Now, let's look at the remaining rounds. I only have 9 rounds left.

Therefore, I **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. Considering the accumulated inflation (48.8% reduction in value from Round 1) and the decreasing number of rounds, I need to be more aggressive to secure a reasonable share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money, considering the accumulated inflation.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1. So, $250,000 is now worth $250,000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $82,075 in terms of Round 1 value.

We are now in Round 6, and I only have 7 rounds to go. The value of money is diminishing rapidly.

Given the diminishing value and the dwindling rounds, I must consider if accepting this offer is better than risking ending with nothing. I'll consider accepting the offer, since the value of the money is getting so small.

Therefore, I **accept** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
