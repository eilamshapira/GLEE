"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the reduced amount. I'll propose a 50-50 split of the reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 36% reduction in value for me, the effective amount I would get is $3500 * 0.64 = $2240.

However, since this is a one-time payment, I should consider the actual dollar amount I would receive, which is $3500.

Given the significant reduction in value for me in each round, I should aim to accept an offer sooner rather than later.
