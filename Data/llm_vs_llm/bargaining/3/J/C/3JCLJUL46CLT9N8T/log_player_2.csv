"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair split considering potential inflation impacting me. Let's take it and avoid further risk. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. This isn't an even split, but I need to factor in the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the total money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $4,500. If I reject and we eventually reach a deal where I get a larger percentage of a smaller pie, I might end up with less actual value.
