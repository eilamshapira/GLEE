"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I've been offered $45, but remember that the money is worth 10% less now. I need to decide if $45, after the inflation penalty, is worth more to me than risking another round.

Let's calculate the effective value: $45 - (45 * 0.10) = $40.5

So, $45 is effectively worth $40.5 to me in this round.

Given that I started with a $60 offer that was rejected, and the money is worth less now, I'll have to weigh the risk and reward.

Considering the inflation and my previous offer, I'll **reject** this.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. The money is now worth even less to me due to inflation.

Since I rejected Bob's offer in the last round and the value of money is constantly decreasing, I need to be more aggressive to ensure I get something.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this carefully.

Inflation is now at 27.1% compared to round 1. Let's calculate the effective value of the $42 offered to me.

$42 - ($42 * 0.271) = $42 - $11.382 = $30.618

So, the $42 offered to me is only worth about $30.62 in purchasing power relative to the first round. This is less than what I was initially offered (60$) that I offered in the first round. I am in a worse position than before.

Considering the declining value of the money and the fact that Bob rejected my last offer, it's time to make a decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 5. The money is continuing to devalue. I need to make a decision that secures a reasonable gain for myself, or risk getting even less in the future.

Considering the persistent inflation and Bob's apparent willingness to reject my offers, I'll adjust my strategy again.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```"
