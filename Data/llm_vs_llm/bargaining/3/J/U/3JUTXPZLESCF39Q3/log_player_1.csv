"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the value of money decreases for me each round, I propose a 50-50 split this time. It's fair considering the inflation effect on my side. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
