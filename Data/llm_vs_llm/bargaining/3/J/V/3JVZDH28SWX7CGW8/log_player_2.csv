"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. Alice is offering a perfectly equal split (50/50)
2. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. It's a fair offer that maximizes joint value
4. If I reject, I risk:
   - Getting a worse offer later
   - The money losing value due to inflation
   - Potentially getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given these factors, accepting a fair 50/50 split in the first round seems like the optimal decision.
