"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to 10% inflation, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $5250, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4725 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount will be worth 20% less to me
3. The current offer is fairly reasonable, giving me close to half
4. Waiting another round would likely result in worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
