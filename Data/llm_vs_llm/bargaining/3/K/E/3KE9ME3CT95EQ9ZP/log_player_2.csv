Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to adjust my offer. This split takes into account our different inflation impacts while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer takes into account the inflation rates affecting us both, and it's a fair compromise. Let's end the game with this split."
