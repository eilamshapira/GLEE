"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $45, while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't a perfectly equal split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer
2. Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation
3. My money keeps its value
4. I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer

However, $45 is a decent amount, and if I get too greedy, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds where her share loses more value, making her less likely to accept reasonable offers.

Given that it's a reasonable first offer and we could both lose by dragging this out, I'll accept.
