"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation effect, I need to consider if waiting would be better. If I reject now, I can make my own offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me.

Current offer: $500,000 for me

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total will be worth only 80% of its value to me. So even if I got the entire $1,000,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $800,000 to me.

Since $500,000 now is better than potentially getting less value later (due to inflation), and this is a fair 50-50 split, I'll accept.
