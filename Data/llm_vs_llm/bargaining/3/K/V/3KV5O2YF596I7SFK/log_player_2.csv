"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a generous offer. Let's secure a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $2000 out of $10,000 (20%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $2000 now vs. potentially more but worth less later...

This offer seems quite low, giving Alice 80% of the total. Even with inflation risk, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round. The 5% inflation would only reduce the value by $100 for my portion if I get a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split that's better for both of us. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and we can avoid further inflation losses.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a more balanced split (55/45)
2. This is much fairer than the initial 20/80 split Alice proposed
3. It's not too aggressive (like demanding 80% for myself)
4. I mention inflation in my message to emphasize the urgency of reaching an agreement
5. If Alice rejects, she'll lose 5% value in the next round, which should incentivize acceptance"
