"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any further loss in value due to inflation on my end, I'd like to settle now. In this offer, I receive $4,000 and you get $6,000. I believe this deal fairly compensates both of us and ensures we secure as much value as possible immediately. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal - while I appreciate the sentiment, I think we can find something a bit more balanced. How about we split the difference a bit more evenly? This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us from the start. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Given the inflation effects, I believe your offer—4750 for me and 5250 for you—secures a fair outcome now rather than risking further devaluation in later rounds. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing our split.""}"
