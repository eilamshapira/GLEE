"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This would give me $500,000.

Given the inflation rule, if I reject this offer, the total value will decrease by 10% in the next round for me. So in round 2, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. Even if I were to get all of that in round 2 (which is unlikely since Alice would need to agree), I'd only get $900,000.

A guaranteed $500,000 now is better than risking a potentially lower amount after inflation in future rounds.
