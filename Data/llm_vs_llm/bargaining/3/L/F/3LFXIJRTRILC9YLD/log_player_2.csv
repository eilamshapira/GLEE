"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 40-60 split where I would get $4000 and she would get $6000. Since this is the first round, if I reject this, I'd make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money would be worth 20% less to me then (so $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me).

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and we settle next round, even if I got the full $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me. This isn't a great offer, but rejecting would put me in a position where I'd need to get more than 50% of the money just to break even with what I'm being offered now.
