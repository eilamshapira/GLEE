"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of the 1,000,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and move to the next round, I can make my own offer, but due to 5% inflation, the total value will be worth 950,000$ to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than 400,000$, but I'd be dealing with a 5% reduction in value. Also, Alice would then have the power to accept or reject my offer.

Since 400,000$ is a substantial amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I'll accept this offer.
