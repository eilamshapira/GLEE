"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, while taking $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   * The total value will be worth 10% less to me
   * So the maximum I could get would be $900,000 in nominal terms
   * But due to 10% inflation, that would be worth $810,000 in real terms

While the 60-40 split isn't ideal, rejecting and moving to the next round means I'm already losing 10% of the value. Even if I managed to get a better split in the next round, I might end up with less in real terms.

$400,000 now is better than the risk of getting less in real terms after inflation.
