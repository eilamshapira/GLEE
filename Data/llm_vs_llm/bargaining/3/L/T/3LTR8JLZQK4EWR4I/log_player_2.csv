"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $400000. Remember, the value decreases with each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
Reason: While a 40/60 split seems somewhat fair at first glance, I want to see if Alice is willing to offer a better deal. The inflation factor means it's in both of our best interests to settle quickly, so she might be willing to give up a larger share to avoid multiple rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly better split. How about this?""
}
``` 

Reason: I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for me, hoping Alice will want to avoid further inflation. It's still a reasonable offer that benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a better split, but remember the value is decreasing for me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reason:  Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is trying to meet me halfway. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum, and further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome due to inflation."
