I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. I'm hoping he'll accept, as I don't want to risk the value of the money decreasing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large share for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better to take something now than to risk getting nothing at all later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 70

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm further reducing my offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that his stubbornness is hurting him, and that he'll accept this offer before the value of the money decreases even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is a lot lower than I was hoping for, but the inflation is hitting hard and I'm starting to get worried that we'll both end up with nothing. I'm willing to take a significant loss at this point to secure some money."
