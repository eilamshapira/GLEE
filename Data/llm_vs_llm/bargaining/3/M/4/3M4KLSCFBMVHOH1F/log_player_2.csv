"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000. 

At first glance, this seems fair. However, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value would be worth 5% less to me. So even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, the absolute value would be diminished.

Given that this is a perfectly equal split with no inflation penalty yet, and considering the risk of continued negotiations reducing the overall value, I'll accept this offer.
