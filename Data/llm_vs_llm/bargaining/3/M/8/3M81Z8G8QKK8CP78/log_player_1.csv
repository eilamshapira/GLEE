"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round for me, there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself, but it's still quite fair. This gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that delaying would cost me due to inflation."
