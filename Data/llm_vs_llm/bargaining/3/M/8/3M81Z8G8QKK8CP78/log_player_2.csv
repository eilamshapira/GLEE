"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
* The offer is $4,500 for me and $5,500 for Alice
* If I reject and go to next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
* In next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
* Current offer gives me 45% of the total which is reasonably fair
* After 10% inflation, even a 50-50 split would give me less than $4,500

Given these factors, I think it's best to accept this first offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
