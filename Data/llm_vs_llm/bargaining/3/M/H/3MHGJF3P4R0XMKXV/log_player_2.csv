"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split, with me getting the larger share.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's try a 60/40 split, I'm being generous considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time, Bob. Inflation has hit us both, so let's be fair and call it even. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. However, since Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is more favorable to me than her initial offer, and taking into account the inflation, I think it's a reasonable proposal.
