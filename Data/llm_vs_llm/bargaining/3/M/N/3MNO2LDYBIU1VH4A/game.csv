905000.0,95000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but waiting only hurts both of us – especially you, given the 10% devaluation each round. Accepting my offer secures you 905000 dollars (valued at 0.9×905000 = 814500 in current terms), which is as good as, if not better than, the alternative waiting would provide. Let’s settle now before further losses occur.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, the longer we wait, the less we both get. My offer is still generous, considering the impact of inflation on my share. Take it or risk losing even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
310000.0,690000.0,"Alice, I know the devaluation hurts us both. By rejecting now you’d become proposer in Round 5, but with a 34.39% discount you’d secure roughly $310000 nominal (about $226000 effective) for yourself. I'm offering you exactly that to ensure you don't lose more by waiting. Let's settle now before further losses occur.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable given the situation. This is my final offer. Take it or we both lose significantly more.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, given the steep devaluation if we wait, your final offer gives me an effective value that is hard to beat if we prolong the game further. Let's agree now before further losses occur.",Bob,5,accept
