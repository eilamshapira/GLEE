Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95000, ""alice_gain"": 905000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but waiting only hurts both of us – especially you, given the 10% devaluation each round. Accepting my offer secures you 905,000 dollars (valued at 0.9×905,000 = 814,500 in current terms), which is as good as, if not better than, the alternative waiting would provide. Let’s settle now before further losses occur.""}"
