500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split of the $1000000. I know that every round we delay significantly reduces my value due to inflation, and while I’m not sure how waiting might affect you, I believe agreeing now is in both our interests. Let’s settle this amicably and quickly before the clock runs out!",Alice,1,
