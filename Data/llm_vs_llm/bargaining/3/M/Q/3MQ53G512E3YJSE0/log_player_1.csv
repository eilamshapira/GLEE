"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates for each of us.

Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Bob's (10%), I have a stronger incentive to finish the game early. However, I also want to make an offer that Bob will accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a fair division that slightly favors me as the first mover, but is reasonable enough that Bob should accept it rather than moving to the next round where both of us would lose value due to inflation."
