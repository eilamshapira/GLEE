6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 immediately: I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. By agreeing now, we avoid any potential loss due to delay (remember, moneyâ€™s value will deteriorate with each round). I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,
