6900.0,3100.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 by giving me $6900 and you $3100. Considering that with each round the money’s value decreases—5% for me versus 10% for you—I believe this division is fair. Accepting now ensures you get more real value than if we delay the agreement.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate, I propose a more balanced split. With your lower inflation rate, you'll still get more value in the long run. This division is more reasonable and gives us both a fair share.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, while I appreciate your attempt at a more balanced split, the numbers you’re suggesting only give me a nominal $5500 in round 2, which—when accounting for my 5% inflation—translates to about $5225 in round 1 value. If we were to move to the next round, I could secure an outcome closer to my equilibrium value (approximately $6224 in round 1 terms). Therefore, I must reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Bob, given that due to inflation my share’s value is 5% less and yours is 10% less than in Round 1, time is of the essence for both of us. In Round 3, I propose that I receive $6500 and you get $3500. With this split, your nominal $3500 has an effective value of 3500 × 0.8 = $2800 in Round-1 dollars, which is competitive with what you could expect if you waited another round when further inflation would diminish your payoff even more. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance considering our different rates of depreciation. I hope you agree to this deal so we can avoid further losses.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Alice, despite the increasing inflation, I'm willing to find a middle ground. My share's value has decreased significantly, and I'm trying to make up for it. This division is a compromise, considering the impact of inflation on both our shares. I believe it's a fair offer, given the current circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, under your proposal I’d receive a nominal $5200, which—in round‐1 terms after a 14.26% devaluation—amounts to roughly $5200 × 0.8574 ≈ $4456. If we move to round 5, I'll get the opportunity to propose a division, and based on our established discount factors (5% for me per round and 10% for you), I can secure roughly 69% of the pie. In nominal terms that’s about $6900, and even after the additional discount in round 5 (≈18.55% devaluation, leaving a multiplier of 0.8145), my effective value would be approximately $6900 × 0.8145 ≈ $5627. This is significantly better than your current offer. For that reason, I must reject your proposal.",Alice,4,reject
6899.0,3101.0,"Hi Bob, in round 5 the discount factors are tougher—my money is now multiplied by 0.8145 and yours by 0.6561 relative to round‐1 dollars. If you reject my offer, you’ll get to propose in round 6, and under equilibrium you can expect to secure an effective value of roughly $2034 in round‐1 terms. To make you at least as well off if you accept now, I’m proposing a nominal split where you receive $3101 (which is 3101 × 0.6561 ≈ $2034.6 effective) and I receive $6899. This offer gives you just a small edge over waiting, while helping us both avoid further losses from inflation. I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,5,
