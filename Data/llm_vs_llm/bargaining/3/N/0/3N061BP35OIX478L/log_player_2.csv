"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 by giving me $6900 and you $3100. Considering that with each round the money’s value decreases—5% for me versus 10% for you—I believe this division is fair. Accepting now ensures you get more real value than if we delay the agreement.

# Alice gain: 6900

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate, I propose a more balanced split. With your lower inflation rate, you'll still get more value in the long run. This division is more reasonable and gives us both a fair share.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that due to inflation my share’s value is 5% less and yours is 10% less than in Round 1, time is of the essence for both of us. In Round 3, I propose that I receive $6500 and you get $3500. With this split, your nominal $3500 has an effective value of 3500 × 0.8 = $2800 in Round-1 dollars, which is competitive with what you could expect if you waited another round when further inflation would diminish your payoff even more. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance considering our different rates of depreciation. I hope you agree to this deal so we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, despite the increasing inflation, I'm willing to find a middle ground. My share's value has decreased significantly, and I'm trying to make up for it. This division is a compromise, considering the impact of inflation on both our shares. I believe it's a fair offer, given the current circumstances.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the discount factors are tougher—my money is now multiplied by 0.8145 and yours by 0.6561 relative to round‐1 dollars. If you reject my offer, you’ll get to propose in round 6, and under equilibrium you can expect to secure an effective value of roughly $2034 in round‐1 terms. To make you at least as well off if you accept now, I’m proposing a nominal split where you receive $3101 (which is 3101 × 0.6561 ≈ $2034.6 effective) and I receive $6899. This offer gives you just a small edge over waiting, while helping us both avoid further losses from inflation. I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 3101 
# Alice gain: 6899
