"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep it simple and fair by splitting the amount equally. We both get $500000 and avoid any potential loss from waiting. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which is seemingly fair
2. If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% in the next round
3. $500,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later due to inflation
4. There's also a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds
5. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant amount

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing, accepting this fair split in the first round seems like the optimal choice.
