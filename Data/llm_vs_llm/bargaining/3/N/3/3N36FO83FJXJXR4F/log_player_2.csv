"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to give me $4,500 while taking $5,500. Given that inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% each round, waiting could cost me. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value would be worth 20% less to me.

Let me think about the expected value of waiting. If I reject, I could propose a better split in round 2, but the money would only be worth 80% of its current value to me. So even if I got $5,000 in round 2, that would be worth $4,000 to me after inflation.
