"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering me $40 while she takes $60. This isn't an equal division, and in standard ultimatum games, a 50-50 split is often considered the fairest approach.

However, I need to consider that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round. If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total pot's value to me would be 90% of the original value, or $90. Even if I got 50% in the next round, that would be $45, which is only slightly better than the $40 being offered now.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which is the fairest division. Since we both face inflation risks, an equal split minimizes risk for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has increased her offer slightly to $42 for me (up from $40), while taking $58 for herself. She's also revealed something interesting - the inflation only affects me, not her. This changes my calculation.

Since I now know inflation reduces my value by 10% each round, and we're already in round 3 (19% total reduction), I need to consider this carefully:
- If I accept now, I get $42 at 81% value = $34.02 effective value
- If I reject and propose in round 4, I'd face 27% total inflation (another 10% reduction)
- Even if I proposed a 50-50 split next round and Alice accepted, I'd get $50 at 73% value = $36.50

The difference is relatively small, and there's risk Alice would reject again. Given the inflation disadvantage I have, and that Alice knows she doesn't face inflation, I should accept this offer.
