"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair and reasonable offer considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs. your 10% per round). This division acknowledges our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial portion. I believe this is a fair starting point that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I notice we're both rejecting offers, which hurts us both due to inflation. My $6000 in round 3 is worth less to me than $5400 would have been in round 1, and your $4000 now is worth less than my initial offer of $4600 would have been. Let's try to find common ground before inflation erodes too much value for both of us."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2086 
# Bob gain: 7914 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I see we're still at an impasse. Due to inflation, we're both losing value with each round. My current offer of $5500 to me is actually worth significantly less than my initial offer due to the 59% inflation I've experienced so far. Similarly, your $4500 is worth less than my first offer to you due to your 34.4% inflation. Let's find a compromise soon, as continuing to reject offers is harmful to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1790 
# Bob gain: 8210

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split to break our deadlock. After 7 rounds, my $5000 is actually worth less than $1350 would have been in round 1 due to my 73.8% cumulative inflation. Your $5000 is worth about $2750 in round 1 value due to your 45% cumulative inflation. This is a significant compromise from my side. Let's resolve this before we both end up with nothing."
