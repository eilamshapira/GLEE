"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I'm being offered $40 out of the $100 total. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to another round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I ask for more than $40, the maximum I could get would be from the reduced value of $90. Unless I can secure significantly more than $44.44 (which would be equivalent to $40 now after inflation), it might be better to accept the current offer.
