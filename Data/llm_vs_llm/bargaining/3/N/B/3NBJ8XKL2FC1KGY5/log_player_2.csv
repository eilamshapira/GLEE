"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally, so we both get a fair share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
- This is a completely fair and equal division
- There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in the next round
- This offer aligns with principles of fairness and mutual benefit

Given these considerations, this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
