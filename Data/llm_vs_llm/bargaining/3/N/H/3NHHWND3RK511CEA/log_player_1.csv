Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. It's a fair offer considering the inflation we're both facing. Accepting this will ensure we both get a decent share before the money devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
