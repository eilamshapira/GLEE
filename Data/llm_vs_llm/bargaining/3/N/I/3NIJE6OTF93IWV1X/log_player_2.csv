"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money would be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (while it maintains full value for Alice). This gives Alice a negotiating advantage.

If I accept now, I get $400,000 without any inflation loss. If I reject and we continue negotiating for several rounds, my potential gain could decrease significantly due to the 5% inflation per round.

Given the inflation pressure on my side and the substantial amount offered, I'll accept this offer.
