"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $1,000,000. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, I should aim for a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself while still giving Bob a substantial portion. This recognizes that we both need to agree, and with inflation affecting my gains in future rounds, reaching an agreement early is valuable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts, and given that inflation affects my gains more severely (20% per round) than Bob's (5% per round), it's in my interest to conclude the deal now rather than risk further devaluation in later rounds."
