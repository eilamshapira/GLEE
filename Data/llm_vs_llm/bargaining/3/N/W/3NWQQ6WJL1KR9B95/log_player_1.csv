"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is $5500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 to me.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8100 to me (10% less for two rounds) and $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9025 to Bob (5% less for two rounds).
I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is $5000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth $5000 * (1 - 0.271) = $3650 to me.
On the other hand, an even split seems fair, and I might not get a better deal in the next round.
