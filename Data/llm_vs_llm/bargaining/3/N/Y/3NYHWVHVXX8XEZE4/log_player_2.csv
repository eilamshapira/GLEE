"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this round. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor considering the inflation is impacting me more than her. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The value is dropping fast! I'll take a slight hit with a 60/40 split, but that's my final offer.""}"
