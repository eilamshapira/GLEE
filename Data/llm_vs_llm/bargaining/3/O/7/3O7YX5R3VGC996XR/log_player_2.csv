"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

While $400,000 is a significant amount, it's less than half of the total sum. Given that this is just the first round and we have 11 more opportunities (though with decreasing value due to inflation), I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The 10% inflation per round means we shouldn't wait too long, but we can afford to negotiate a bit.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take a larger share first.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split as it's fair while giving me a slight advantage, but not so uneven that Alice would definitely reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The money is now worth 19% less, so Alice's offer of $450,000 is effectively worth about $364,500
2. If I reject, the next round will have a 29% reduction
3. Alice has moved from her initial 60/40 split to a more reasonable 55/45 split
4. There's risk in continuing negotiation due to increasing inflation

While I could try to negotiate further, the increasing inflation penalty makes this a reasonably fair offer. The movement from Alice towards a more equitable split, combined with the risk of further value loss, makes this worth accepting.
