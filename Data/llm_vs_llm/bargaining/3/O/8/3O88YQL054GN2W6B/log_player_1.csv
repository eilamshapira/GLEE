"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that future rounds will be affected by 5% inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's reasonable and gives both of us a substantial portion. While I'm taking a slightly larger share, it's still fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk a counter-offer in the next round where inflation will affect my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $42.75 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- The longer this goes, the worse it gets for both of us
- Bob's current offer is reasonable, even with the inflation impact

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because continuing to negotiate would result in further value loss due to inflation, and the current split is fair enough considering the circumstances."
