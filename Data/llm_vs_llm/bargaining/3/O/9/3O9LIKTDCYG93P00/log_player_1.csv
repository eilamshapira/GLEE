"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation affects you more heavily than me, so you should accept sooner rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before inflation takes more from us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is: 
1. Due to inflation, if I reject this offer, my next proposal would be worth 10% less to me
2. Bob's even split is fair, and getting $5000 now is better than risking further rounds where both inflation and potential disagreement could lead to worse outcomes
3. If we continue to disagree, we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds
4. Bob is actually accepting a worse deal due to his higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), so this shows good faith"
