"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation per round, if I reject now:
- Next round the $4000 would be worth $3200 to me
- Following rounds would decrease even more drastically
- I have to consider that Alice might make even less favorable offers

While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting $4000 now is better than risking further devaluation of my share. The inflation penalty makes early agreements more valuable.
