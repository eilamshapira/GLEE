6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it fairly, Bob. I take $6000, you get $4000.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise that avoids any delay and the possible cost of waiting. Let's finalize this deal now!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. I'll take a slight hit to get this done. $5700 for me, $4300 for you. Let's close this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, I understand the pressures of time, but given the inflation hit you face each round, waiting only hurts your effective payout. In round 5 you'd be forced to concede almost everything to me to get any agreement at all. With that in mind, I propose a quick settlement where I take $9900 and you receive a nominal $100. It may seem small, but it’s far better than the near-zero outcome awaiting you if we delay further. Let's close this deal now!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, and I'm sure you'd prefer to avoid it going to a sixth round as well.  $5100 for me, $4900 for you. Let's be done with this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, time is unforgiving on your side – every round further erodes the value of the dollars you'll receive. If you reject now, you’ll have to wait for round 7, where your money will be worth even less, leaving you virtually empty‐handed. I’m offering you $1 nominal now, which, while small, is decisively better than the near‐nothing you can expect later. Let's end this swiftly for both our sakes.",Bob,6,
