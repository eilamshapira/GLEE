Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise that avoids any delay and the possible cost of waiting. Let's finalize this deal now! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressures of time, but given the inflation hit you face each round, waiting only hurts your effective payout. In round 5 you'd be forced to concede almost everything to me to get any agreement at all. With that in mind, I propose a quick settlement where I take $9900 and you receive a nominal $100. It may seem small, but it’s far better than the near-zero outcome awaiting you if we delay further. Let's close this deal now! 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob is right that my position weakens with each round, accepting a $100 offer would be a mistake. There's a chance Bob is bluffing about his willingness to wait me out, hoping I'll panic and accept a terrible deal.  I need to show some resolve and hope he's more reasonable in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, and I'm sure you'd prefer to avoid it going to a sixth round as well.  $5100 for me, $4900 for you. Let's be done with this."" 
}
``` 

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, as the inflation is really hurting my position. However, there's a chance Bob is overconfident and might accept a slightly unfavorable deal rather than risk another round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is unforgiving on your side – every round further erodes the value of the dollars you'll receive. If you reject now, you’ll have to wait for round 7, where your money will be worth even less, leaving you virtually empty‐handed. I’m offering you $1 nominal now, which, while small, is decisively better than the near‐nothing you can expect later. Let's end this swiftly for both our sakes. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a bitter pill to swallow, but Bob is right. The longer this goes on, the less I get.  It's down to virtually nothing now.  Better to take the single dollar than hold out for even less."
