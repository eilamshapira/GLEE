"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to account for the higher inflation rate I'm subject to, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle early to maximize value.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000, aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates we're both facing. The message encourages Bob to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This offer is more equitable and leaves room for both of us to gain. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual values for us in this round are:
- For me (Alice), 20% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.
- For Bob, 5% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Considering Bob's offer:
- I would get $400,000, which is half of the $800,000 (the value after inflation for me), but considering the original value and the fact that I'm facing a higher inflation rate, this seems somewhat unfair.
- Bob would get $600,000, which is more than 60% of the $950,000 (the value after inflation for him).

However, since the money will continue to devalue, especially for me at a higher rate, and considering that Bob's offer does give me a significant amount, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

Given these considerations, I decide to reject the offer because it doesn't seem to adequately account for the disparity in inflation rates between us, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal or wait for a round where the devaluation might make Bob more inclined to offer a more favorable split.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that we're in Round 3, the inflation has further reduced the value of the money:
- For me (Alice), the value is now $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000 (40% less than the original value).
- For Bob, the value is now $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500 (9.75% less than the original value, cumulatively).

Considering the increasing disparity in our inflation rates and the fact that I've already lost 40% of the potential value, I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept but also reflects the reality of our situation.

I'll propose a division that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground that acknowledges the devaluation and encourages Bob to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the significant devaluation for both of us, let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.""
}
```

This offer gives me $420,000 and Bob $580,000, aiming to strike a balance that recognizes the impact of inflation on both our potential earnings and encourages Bob to settle in this round. The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the ongoing devaluation."
