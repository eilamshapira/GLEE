60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us both a decent share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Since you face 5% depreciation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's $45 will be worth only $42.75 to you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the depreciation. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split? It's better for me than your last offer, and still gives you a good amount.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be practical - due to 14.5% depreciation on your side, your $40 is still worth about $34.20 to you now, while my $60 stays at full value. This is actually fairer than it appears, and delaying further will only reduce the value for you. Let's agree and both benefit.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  I'm willing to accept this to end the game, but I won't accept anything less. ",Alice,5,
