Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 5% depreciation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's $45 will be worth only $42.75 to you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical - due to 14.5% depreciation on your side, your $40 is still worth about $34.20 to you now, while my $60 stays at full value. This is actually fairer than it appears, and delaying further will only reduce the value for you. Let's agree and both benefit.
