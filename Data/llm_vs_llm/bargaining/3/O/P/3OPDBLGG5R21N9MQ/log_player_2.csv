"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60 for herself. Since money loses 5% value for Alice each round but maintains value for me, I have some leverage by waiting. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where the $100 will be worth less to Alice.

Given that I have the advantage of no inflation on my side, I should reject this uneven split and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 5% depreciation per round and I don't, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rejections.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since you face 5% depreciation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's $45 will be worth only $42.75 to you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the depreciation. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split? It's better for me than your last offer, and still gives you a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $45, less than what I proposed last round
2. Her $55 is actually worth about $49.64 to her due to the 9.75% depreciation
3. If I reject, next round her money will be worth even less (14.5% less than round 1)
4. I still have many rounds left and my money maintains its value

Since I'm in a stronger position due to the inflation effect, and she's offering me less than what I proposed, I should reject and continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since we're in round 4, Alice's money has depreciated further, strengthening my position. I'll increase my ask slightly while explaining the economic reality.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - due to 14.5% depreciation on your side, your $40 is still worth about $34.20 to you now, while my $60 stays at full value. This is actually fairer than it appears, and delaying further will only reduce the value for you. Let's agree and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  I'm willing to accept this to end the game, but I won't accept anything less.  
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split
2. Due to 18.55% depreciation, her $50 is actually worth only about $40.73 to her
3. My $50 maintains full value
4. Alice appears to be taking a firm stance
5. If I reject, her money will depreciate further, but she might become more entrenched in her position
6. We're already 5 rounds in, and prolonging might lead to a stalemate

Given that this is actually a reasonably fair deal (I get $50 full value, she gets effectively $40.73), and considering her firm stance, I should accept this offer. Further negotiation might lead to deteriorating relationships and potentially worse outcomes.
