"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems closer to a ""fair"" split at first glance, the decreasing value of the money makes this a bad deal for me. 

* **My perspective:** Accepting Bob's offer means I get $45 now, which is already less than the $60 I proposed in Round 1. 
* **Potential next round:** If I reject, I get to propose in Round 3. Even with another 5% inflation hit, I can offer Bob slightly more than he's getting now (due to his 10% inflation) and still come out ahead of his current offer.

This strategy relies on Bob being somewhat motivated by maximizing his own gains, even if it means accepting a slightly less ""fair"" split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 56,
""bob_gain"": 44,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's settle this. How about 56 for me and 44 for you? This deal benefits us both considering the money is losing value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Account for inflation:**  The money has devalued again for both of us. My offer is designed to be appealing to Bob while still getting me more than his previous offer.
* **Appear reasonable:**  I'm slightly increasing Bob's share from his previous offer, making it seem like I'm compromising.
* **Emphasize the loss:** By highlighting that the money is losing value, I'm hoping to pressure Bob into accepting a deal sooner rather than later."
