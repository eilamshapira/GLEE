Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, and Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not there. Continued rejection might make her more amenable to a fair deal."
