"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair to both of us. We both know there's 10% inflation per round for me, so accepting quickly benefits me. I'm not sure how inflation affects you, but a fair split now means we both walk away with substantial money without further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
