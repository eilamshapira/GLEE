"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm taking the bigger share since I'm making the offer, but I'm leaving you a decent amount. Hopefully, you'll accept so we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000. That's only 10% for me versus 90% for her, which doesn't seem particularly fair.

Given the 10% inflation per round, if I reject this offer, the total money will be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. If I make a counter-offer, I could propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair to both of us. We both know there's 10% inflation per round for me, so accepting quickly benefits me. I'm not sure how inflation affects you, but a fair split now means we both walk away with substantial money without further negotiations.""}"
