"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider that the value of the money decreases for both of us as we delay. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $40 offered to me is actually worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's 10% * 2 = 20% less than the original value. So, the money I gain is worth 80% of its original value. For Bob, the money he gains is worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value, so it's 60% of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't let inflation eat away our money!""}"
