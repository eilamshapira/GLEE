"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering the higher inflation rate that affects me (10% vs your 5%).""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This is a more balanced proposal, acknowledging the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $49.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (20% less than original value)
- Bob's current offer acknowledges the inflation difference and is fairly reasonable
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
