"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that I (Alice) face a 10% loss in value each round while Bob doesn't, I should make a compelling initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a reasonable first offer giving me 60% and Bob 40% of the total amount. I'm offering Bob a substantial sum of $400,000 while keeping a larger share for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, in the next round the total value will be worth 10% less to me, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it, while still giving me a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000 at 90% value = $360,000 effective value to me
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 100% value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * Next round will be worth another 10% less to me (80% total)
   * Bob might reject again, leading to even worse situations
   * The time decay puts me at a disadvantage

While this offer gives Bob more than me, rejecting it could lead to even worse outcomes for me due to the time decay. Given that I still get a substantial amount ($360,000 in effective value) and the risk of getting less in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
