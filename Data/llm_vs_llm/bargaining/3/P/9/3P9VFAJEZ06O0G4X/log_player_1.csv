"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 2 I'm proposing a division where I get $6000 and you get $4000. I believe that this offer is a fair compromise given the current negotiation and our mutual concerns about inflation. Accepting now avoids further rounds and any additional uncertainties. I look forward to a swift agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
