"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is much more reasonable than Alice's initial extreme offer. This gives Alice a substantial portion while still compensating me for the unfair first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer that gives me a substantial portion ($400,000) of the total amount. While it's not as favorable as my previous proposal, it's a fair split and much better than Alice's initial offer. Accepting this prevents the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to worse outcomes."
