"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a slightly favorable split for me, but still quite fair for Bob considering that he faces a higher inflation penalty (10% vs my 5%) if we move to the next round. This gives him an incentive to accept now rather than delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for our current situation.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal to Bob compared to my first offer, recognizing that we're now in the third round where inflation is affecting both of us (my money is worth about 10% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth about 19% less). This is a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to Bob given the increasing inflation penalties."
