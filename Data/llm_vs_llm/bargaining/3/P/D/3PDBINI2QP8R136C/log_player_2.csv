"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than my potential gain in the next round. 

* **Current offer:** I get $48.
* **Potential next round:** If I reject and propose a 55/45 split again, even if Alice accepts, the inflation would reduce my share to ~$44 (55 minus 19%).

It's a gamble to hope for a better offer from Alice in future rounds, especially as the money continues to lose value."
