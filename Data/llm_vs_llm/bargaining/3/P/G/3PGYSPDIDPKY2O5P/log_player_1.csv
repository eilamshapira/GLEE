Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. We both face time pressure with the declining value, so this equal division allows us both to walk away with a good outcome without dragging negotiations and losing value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
