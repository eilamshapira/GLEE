"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. With 5% inflation per round, if I reject now and propose next round, the total value will be worth only $95 to me. If I aim for a 50/50 split next round, that would be $47.50 for me, which is better than $40 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I believe a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. We both face time pressure with the declining value, so this equal division allows us both to walk away with a good outcome without dragging negotiations and losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but a 50/50 split isn't fair considering I proposed first.  Let's meet in the middle - 55/45 reflects the initial advantage and allows us both to benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $45 while she takes $55. 

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1. So $45 now is equivalent to about $40.61 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will be even higher, and the total value will continue to decrease for me. If I propose a 50/50 split in round 4, that would be $50 with even more inflation applied.

Since $45 now is better than what I initially was offered ($40), and considering the increasing inflation risk, I should accept this compromise.
