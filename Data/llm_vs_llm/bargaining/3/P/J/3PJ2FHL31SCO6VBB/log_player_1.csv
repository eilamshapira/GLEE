"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the 20% per round inflation penalty I face. Since Bob doesn't face inflation, he might be tempted to delay, but I'll offer him a reasonable amount to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair 60-40 split that gives Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob delays, my future gains will be worth less due to inflation
3. This offer gives Bob a good immediate reward while still leaving me with a reasonable share"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4500, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
   * Bob gets $5500 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But I'll face 40% total inflation on my share
   * Bob still faces no inflation

Given that:
- The offer isn't terrible considering inflation
- Further delays will significantly reduce my purchasing power
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer from me next round
- We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
