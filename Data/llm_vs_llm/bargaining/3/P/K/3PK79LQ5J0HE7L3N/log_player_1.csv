"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit unfair. Considering we both want to avoid inflation losses, I propose a more balanced split: 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
