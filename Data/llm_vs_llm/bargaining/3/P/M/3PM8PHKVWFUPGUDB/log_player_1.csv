"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rates. Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%), I should try to secure a fair deal early.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because while it gives me a larger share, it's still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation eating into both our gains. The 60-40 split acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement, while accounting for my higher inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

For me, $4500 after 1 round of inflation (20%) is actually worth $3600.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth another 20% less.

This offer gives me less than my initial proposal, but waiting longer will significantly reduce the real value I receive due to my high inflation rate. Bob's inflation rate is much lower at 5%, so they have less pressure to agree quickly.

Since we only have 12 rounds total, and each round reduces my purchasing power significantly, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in later rounds.
