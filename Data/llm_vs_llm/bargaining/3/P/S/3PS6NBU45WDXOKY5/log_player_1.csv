"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects you more, I'm willing to give you a bit less than half. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you'll be motivated to accept before the money devalues further for you. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
