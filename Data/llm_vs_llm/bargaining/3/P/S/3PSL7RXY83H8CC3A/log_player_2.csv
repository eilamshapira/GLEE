"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. However, I should keep in mind that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value for me would be subject to 10% inflation, meaning the maximum I could get would be $9,000 (90% of $10,000). If I asked for most of that, Alice might reject, forcing us into further rounds with more inflation for me.

An even split now guarantees me $5,000 without risk of further inflation or ending up with nothing if we go all 12 rounds without agreement.
