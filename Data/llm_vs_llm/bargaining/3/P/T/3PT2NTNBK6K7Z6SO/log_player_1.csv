"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more in my favor, considering the decreasing value for you 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. With 20% inflation, if I accept $40 now, it's actually worth $32 to me (40 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 40% less
3. In round 3, if Bob rejects again, my money would be worth 60% less
4. Given this declining value, taking $32 worth now might be better than risking further depreciation
