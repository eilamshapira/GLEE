"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$.

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The total value will be worth 10% less to me (so 9000$ total value for me)
- I'll get to make the next proposal
- But Alice might reject that too, leading to further rounds and more value loss

4000$ right now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pot later, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Alice's decisions.
