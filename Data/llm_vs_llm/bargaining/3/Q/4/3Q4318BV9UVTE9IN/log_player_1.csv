"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose to give myself $550,000 (55%) and Bob $450,000 (45%). This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous for me. If Bob rejects, the 5% inflation will affect my next potential gains, so this is a balanced first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer, I'll get $450,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $427,500 to me.

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - I'll face another 5% inflation (total 10% less value)
   - Bob might reject again
   - I might end up with even less value in the end

3. $427,500 is still a significant amount, and the risk of getting less in future rounds due to compounding inflation is considerable.

4. This is a reasonable offer, even though it's less than my initial proposal.
