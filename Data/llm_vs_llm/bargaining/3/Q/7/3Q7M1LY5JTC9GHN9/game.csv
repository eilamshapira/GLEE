600000.0,400000.0,Let's make a fair split where I get a bit more for making the first move. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite generous, but I'm sure you understand the need for a more balanced approach. Let's expedite this process. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the time value of money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% total inflation effect on your gains so far, if we continue negotiating, your purchasing power will keep decreasing. This 55/45 split in my favor is actually better for you than continuing further rounds. It's a fair compromise from both our initial positions.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  Let's find a solution.  I'm willing to concede a bit more than before, acknowledging the time pressure.  A 52/48 split in my favor seems like a fair compromise, considering the circumstances.  What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's end this now. The inflation has already reduced your purchasing power by over 27%. If we continue, your share will be worth even less. This 60/40 split actually gives you more real value than continuing further rounds where inflation will eat away more of your share. This is the best outcome for both of us at this point.",Alice,5,
