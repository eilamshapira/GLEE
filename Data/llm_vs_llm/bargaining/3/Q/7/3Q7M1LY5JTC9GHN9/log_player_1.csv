"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split where I get a bit more for making the first move. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite generous, but I'm sure you understand the need for a more balanced approach. Let's expedite this process. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $450,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I could potentially get more, but Bob might reject again
   - My money maintains its value
3. $450,000 is still a significant amount
4. The difference between this and my initial offer ($600,000) is $150,000
5. There's risk in continuing to negotiate

Given that Bob's position will weaken in the next round due to inflation, and I maintain my purchasing power, I'll reject this offer and try for a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% total inflation effect on your gains so far, if we continue negotiating, your purchasing power will keep decreasing. This 55/45 split in my favor is actually better for you than continuing further rounds. It's a fair compromise from both our initial positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  Let's find a solution.  I'm willing to concede a bit more than before, acknowledging the time pressure.  A 52/48 split in my favor seems like a fair compromise, considering the circumstances.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Bob is now offering me $480,000 (no inflation impact for me)
2. Bob's $520,000 is actually worth only about $379,080 to him (due to 27.1% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will see Bob's value decrease even more
   - I maintain my purchasing power
   - But we're losing time and efficiency
4. Bob is showing movement in my direction (from 55/45 to 52/48)
5. However, given the significant inflation impact on Bob's side, I can probably get a better deal in the next round

Given that Bob's position continues to weaken significantly due to inflation, and I maintain my purchasing power, I'll reject this offer and aim for a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's end this now. The inflation has already reduced your purchasing power by over 27%. If we continue, your share will be worth even less. This 60/40 split actually gives you more real value than continuing further rounds where inflation will eat away more of your share. This is the best outcome for both of us at this point.""}"
