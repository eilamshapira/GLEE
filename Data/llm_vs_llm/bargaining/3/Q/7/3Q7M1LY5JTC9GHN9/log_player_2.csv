"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split where I get a bit more for making the first move. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems tempting, it's important to remember the inflation. Accepting a 40/60 split in the first round means I'm potentially losing out on a larger sum if I wait.  There's a chance Alice is more sensitive to inflation than I am, or that she values a quick agreement highly. By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a more equitable split and put the pressure on her for the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite generous, but I'm sure you understand the need for a more balanced approach. Let's expedite this process. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the time value of money."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% total inflation effect on your gains so far, if we continue negotiating, your purchasing power will keep decreasing. This 55/45 split in my favor is actually better for you than continuing further rounds. It's a fair compromise from both our initial positions. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is using clever tactics, trying to leverage the inflation against me. While it's true that my potential gains are decreasing with each round, her offer is still not acceptable. It's crucial not to fall into the trap of thinking about the ""original"" value of the money - I need to focus on maximizing my current purchasing power. 

By rejecting again, I call her bluff. She claims the 55/45 split is her ""final offer,"" but she needs to be aware that continued negotiation hurts her gains as well (even if the impact is less severe than on mine).  There's a chance she folds in the next round and offers something more agreeable."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  Let's find a solution.  I'm willing to concede a bit more than before, acknowledging the time pressure.  A 52/48 split in my favor seems like a fair compromise, considering the circumstances.  What do you say?""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to sweeten the deal slightly while still aiming for a favorable outcome. The goal is to signal a willingness to compromise without significantly reducing my share. By offering 52/48, I'm giving up a small amount to potentially close the deal and, importantly, avoid further inflation losses.  The tone of the message also aims to create a more collaborative atmosphere, which might nudge Alice towards acceptance."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's end this now. The inflation has already reduced your purchasing power by over 27%. If we continue, your share will be worth even less. This 60/40 split actually gives you more real value than continuing further rounds where inflation will eat away more of your share. This is the best outcome for both of us at this point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right. While her offer is still not ideal, the cumulative effect of the inflation is too significant to ignore. Accepting 400,000 now is better than risking further losses for a potentially slightly better deal later. It's frustrating to settle for less than initially hoped for, but continuing the negotiation poses too much downside at this point."
