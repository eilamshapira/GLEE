"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 out of $100
* This is less than half, but still a significant amount
* It's the first round, so I have more opportunities to negotiate
* However, with each round there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree
* The amount is worth the same to me in future rounds (0% inflation for me)

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving a small advantage to Alice to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

This is a fairer distribution than the previous offer, moving closer to an equal split while still giving Alice a slight advantage. I hope she'll find this more reasonable than my taking a $20 loss compared to an even split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* She's offering me $42.5 (up from her initial $40 offer)
* I know the money is worth 9.75% less to her now
* For me, the value hasn't changed due to inflation
* Her $57.5 is actually worth less to her now due to inflation
* We're in round 3 of 12, still early but rounds are passing
* Her offer shows some movement in my direction

While this is better than her first offer, I think there's still room for negotiation, and since inflation is affecting her but not me, I might get a better deal in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that inflation is affecting Alice but not me, and she's shown some willingness to move up from her initial offer, I'll propose a slightly more balanced split:

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}

This is a reasonable offer because:
1. It's close to an equal split
2. Alice's portion is worth less to her due to inflation (9.75% less than round 1), so she might be more motivated to agree soon
3. It still gives her a slight advantage
4. We're now 1/3 through our available rounds, so we should be moving towards agreement
5. The offer demonstrates continued movement towards a middle ground"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:
* She's offering me $45 (up from her previous $42.5)
* Inflation for her is now at 18.55%, significantly reducing her buying power
* Her $55 is worth substantially less to her now
* We're at round 5 of 12, approaching the halfway point
* She's shown consistent movement upward in my favor
* Her $55 is actually worth only about $44.80 to her due to inflation
* The risk of getting nothing is increasing as rounds pass

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation impact on Alice and the increasing risk of running out of rounds, I think this is a reasonable offer to accept.
