Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 473685 
# Alice gain: 526315 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation for me.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away for a fairer deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This is a tough decision, as the offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. However, the value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, is better than risking getting even less in future rounds."
