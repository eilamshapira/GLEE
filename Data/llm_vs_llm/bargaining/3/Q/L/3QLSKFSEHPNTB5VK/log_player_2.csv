"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $5263 and you receive $4737. Given that with each round the total amount loses 10% of its value, this split is designed to reflect the fair outcome if we were to negotiate further. Accepting now ensures we both get as much as possible under the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
