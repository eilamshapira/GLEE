"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, I should consider that:

1. The money will lose 5% value next round (making the total worth $9,500)
2. Alice might respond with a less favorable offer if I reject
3. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair and equitable

Given these factors, it's rational to accept this fair offer immediately rather than risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation and potential negotiation breakdown.
