Alice's offer:

While the offer is getting slightly better, the inflation is heavily impacting Alice. I need to hold out for a better deal while she still has a strong incentive to settle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35} 

This is a strong offer considering the inflation for Alice.  I'm hoping she recognizes the significant loss she'll face if she continues to reject and the pot shrinks further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting too close for comfort. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I need to hold out a bit longer for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This is my final push.  It's a risky move, but with the inflation rapidly devaluing the money, Alice is running out of time to secure even this much."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it very close, but I need to accept before the inflation eats away at the offer further.  Taking the sure thing at this point is the best strategy."
