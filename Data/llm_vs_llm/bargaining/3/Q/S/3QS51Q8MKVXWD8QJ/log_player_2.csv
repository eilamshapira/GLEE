"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair first offer, and given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, an even split protects both of us from potential value loss in future rounds.
