"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more balanced proposal in the next round, considering that money will be worth less for both of us due to inflation, but especially for Alice who faces 20% depreciation per round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose a more balanced split that still gives both of us a substantial amount. This is fair considering that Alice needs to act quickly due to her higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 10% per round). If she rejects this, by next round her share would be worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate she faces."
