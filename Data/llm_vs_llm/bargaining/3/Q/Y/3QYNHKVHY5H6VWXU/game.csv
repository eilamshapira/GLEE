5000.0,5000.0,I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with equal amounts and can finish the game now.,Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, while your offer was tempting for a quick resolution, I believe a slightly more favorable split is fair considering the inflation working against me.  This offer still allows you to walk away with a significant sum.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, that's precisely why we should complete this now. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation affecting you. This split is actually more favorable to you than what you'll effectively receive if we continue haggling. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value to inflation.",Alice,3,
