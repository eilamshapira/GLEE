"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your offer was tempting for a quick resolution, I believe a slightly more favorable split is fair considering the inflation working against me.  This offer still allows you to walk away with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, that's precisely why we should complete this now. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation affecting you. This split is actually more favorable to you than what you'll effectively receive if we continue haggling. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value to inflation.""}"
