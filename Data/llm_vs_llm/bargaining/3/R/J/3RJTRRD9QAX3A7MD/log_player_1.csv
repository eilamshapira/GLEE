"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty Bob faces in each round. If he rejects this offer, his money will be worth less in the next round, which gives me some leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a significant portion for Bob that's worth taking now rather than waiting
2. If Bob rejects, his next-round money will be worth 20% less, making this offer more attractive
3. It's not so greedy that it would appear unfair and trigger an emotional rejection"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (at 80% value = $440,000 effective value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 20% less (60% of original value)
   * This gives me even more leverage

However, $450,000 is still a substantial amount, and if I reject, there's a risk of ending up with less in a drawn-out negotiation. The current offer is fairly reasonable.
