"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. If I reject and move to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20%, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $800,000 to me. Any division in the next round would be based on this reduced value.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to propose something that gives me more than the equivalent of $400,000 from the current round, accounting for the 20% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I need to make a counter-offer that accounts for the 20% inflation that affects me. I should aim for a fair division while acknowledging the inflation asymmetry.

Given that Alice experiences no inflation while I face 20% inflation per round, I'll propose a division that compensates for this disadvantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice $450,000 while taking $550,000 for myself. This is a fair adjustment considering that if we go to another round, I'll face additional inflation and Alice won't. This gives Alice a substantial portion while allowing me to offset some of the inflation disadvantage I face in this negotiation."
