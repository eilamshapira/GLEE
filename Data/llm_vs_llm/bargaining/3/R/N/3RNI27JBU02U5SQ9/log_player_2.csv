"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Bob, and I need to consider the decreasing value of the money with each round.

Alice's offer is 50 for me, 50 for her. Before I decide, I need to consider what will happen if I reject.

If I reject, it's my turn to propose in round 2. However, the 50 dollars I'm being offered now will be worth 10% less in the next round. In other words, it would be worth 45 dollars today.

If I accept, I get 50 dollars of present value. If I reject, I will propose. Suppose I take the all money in round 2. It's worth 90 dollars. And since inflation affects Alice, she might reject it, meaning I will lose all the money.

I will accept the offer.
