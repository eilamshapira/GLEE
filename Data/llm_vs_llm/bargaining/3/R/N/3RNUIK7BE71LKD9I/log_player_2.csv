"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60-40 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, where I can propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while remaining reasonable.

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both walk away with half a million dollars.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split towards a more reasonable 55-45 split, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, we still have 9 rounds left, and I believe we can reach an even more equitable arrangement. The difference between her proposal and a fair 50-50 split is still $100,000, which is significant.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split. I'm now proposing a 52-48 split in your favor, which is much closer to equal while still giving you a larger share. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.""
