"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. While 4000$ is a significant amount, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. Keep in mind that even though we'll lose 10% value next round, having leverage to make my own proposal might lead to a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly equal split. This is fair to both parties, and considering we've already lost 10% of the total value due to inflation from the first round, we should aim to reach an agreement soon. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution and should be acceptable to both parties."
