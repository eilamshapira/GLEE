60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I appreciate your equal split offer, but it's not actually fair because of the inflation penalty I face. The $50 you offered me is only worth $40 to me due to 20% inflation after two rounds. I need to receive more to account for this penalty. A 60-40 split is more equitable given my disadvantage. Let's agree now before further inflation diminishes my share even more.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share too. Let's compromise with a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can avoid further rounds which could lead to both of us getting nothing.",Bob,4,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and the inflation effect has increased significantly. What was worth $100 to me in round 1 is now worth only about 50% of that. Your last offer of $45 to me would actually be worth less than $25 in round 1 value. I need to receive more to compensate for this severe inflation penalty. A 65-35 split is reasonable given my growing disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, my potential gain will continue to shrink dramatically with each round. Let's reach an agreement now.",Alice,5,
