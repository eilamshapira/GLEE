"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer and include a message for Bob to consider.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your equal split offer, but it's not actually fair because of the inflation penalty I face. The $50 you offered me is only worth $40 to me due to 20% inflation after two rounds. I need to receive more to account for this penalty. A 60-40 split is more equitable given my disadvantage. Let's agree now before further inflation diminishes my share even more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share too. Let's compromise with a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can avoid further rounds which could lead to both of us getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and the inflation effect has increased significantly. What was worth $100 to me in round 1 is now worth only about 50% of that. Your last offer of $45 to me would actually be worth less than $25 in round 1 value. I need to receive more to compensate for this severe inflation penalty. A 65-35 split is reasonable given my growing disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, my potential gain will continue to shrink dramatically with each round. Let's reach an agreement now.""
