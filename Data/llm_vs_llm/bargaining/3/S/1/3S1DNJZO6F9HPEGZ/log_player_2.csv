"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your equal split offer, but it's not actually fair because of the inflation penalty I face. The $50 you offered me is only worth $40 to me due to 20% inflation after two rounds. I need to receive more to account for this penalty. A 60-40 split is more equitable given my disadvantage. Let's agree now before further inflation diminishes my share even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share too. Let's compromise with a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can avoid further rounds which could lead to both of us getting nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and the inflation effect has increased significantly. What was worth $100 to me in round 1 is now worth only about 50% of that. Your last offer of $45 to me would actually be worth less than $25 in round 1 value. I need to receive more to compensate for this severe inflation penalty. A 65-35 split is reasonable given my growing disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, my potential gain will continue to shrink dramatically with each round. Let's reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
