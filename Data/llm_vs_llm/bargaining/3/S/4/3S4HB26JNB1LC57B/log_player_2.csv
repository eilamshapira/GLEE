I need to keep pushing for a better deal. While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, accepting a 30/70 split at this stage is too much of a loss."

I'm lowering my demand slightly, as it's important to show some flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a larger share, considering the inflation working against me."

This is getting tight! However, accepting 40% now would leave me with significantly less than half of the initial value. I need to gamble on at least one more counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point, considering the significant impact inflation has had on the value of my potential winnings."
