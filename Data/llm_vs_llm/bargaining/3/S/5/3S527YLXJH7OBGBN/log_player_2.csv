"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get it done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Reason:While the current offer is tempting, it's heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm banking on the fact that inflation will make her more amenable to a fairer split in later rounds. 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer is more in line with a fair split. Let's wrap this up.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm adjusting my offer based on the previous round. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

```
Reason: Although not ideal, this offer is now within a reasonable range for me to accept. Accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation.
