"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start, taking into account that inflation affects my earnings more with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without any inflation loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob seems to be seeking an advantage, but I need to be mindful of the increasing inflation impact on my earnings (10% per round for me, only 5% per round for Bob). Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 470000, 
""bob_gain"": 530000}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for our different inflation rates. Since I lose more value with each passing round than Bob does, I'm offering a slight advantage to Bob while still ensuring I get a fair portion. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges our different situations while still being equitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is gradually increasing his offers, and we're now facing significant inflation effects. I need to consider the diminishing value of future rounds carefully.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm making this revised offer considering our different inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 5. With my money losing value at 10% per round (now worth 34.39% less than round 1) and Bob's at 5% per round, this division acknowledges our different positions while still being fair. This offer gives Bob a meaningful advantage while ensuring I receive a reasonable portion. Let's resolve this now before further rounds reduce the value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000
