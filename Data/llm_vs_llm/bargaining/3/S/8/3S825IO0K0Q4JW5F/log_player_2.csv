"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a 40-60 split of the $100, where I (Bob) would get $40 and Alice would get $60.

I need to consider:
1. This is the first round
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Inflation affects Alice more than me (her money loses 5% value each round, mine doesn't lose value)
4. If we keep negotiating, Alice's bargaining position weakens due to inflation

Given that inflation doesn't affect me but decreases Alice's value by 5% per round, I'm in a stronger position by rejecting and making a counter-offer. The $60 Alice wants would be worth 5% less to her next round, potentially making her more willing to accept a better deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer that accounts for the inflation dynamics.

Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation, I have a stronger negotiating position. If we delay further, Alice's potential gains lose more value to her, while mine remain stable.

I'll propose a more balanced split that still recognizes my advantage:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer gives me a slight majority while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk another round of inflation affecting her share. If she rejects, her $45 would be worth about $42.75 to her in the next round, weakening her position further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $42.5 (up from her initial $40 offer) while she would get $57.5.

Important considerations:
1. We're now in round 3
2. Alice faces 9.75% inflation so far (meaning her $57.5 is effectively worth about $51.9 to her)
3. I face no inflation, so my $42.5 maintains full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer next round when Alice's inflation will be even higher (around 15%)

Given the inflation asymmetry continues to strengthen my position, and Alice has only increased her offer to me by $2.5 despite facing significant inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has faced increasing inflation while I haven't, I'll make an offer that accounts for our respective positions.

Alice now faces approximately 15% inflation if we go to the next round, which significantly weakens her bargaining position. Her previous offer showed she's willing to move somewhat from her initial position, but not enough considering the inflation dynamics.

I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than face another round of inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer is reasonable given the circumstances. If Alice rejects, her potential $40 would be worth only about $34 to her in the next round due to continued inflation, which should make accepting this offer more attractive than continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $45 (up from her previous offers of $40 and $42.5) while she would get $55.

Key considerations:
1. We're now in round 5
2. Alice faces 18.55% inflation, meaning her $55 is effectively worth about $44.8 to her
3. I still face no inflation, so my $45 maintains full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer when Alice's inflation will be around 24%
5. Alice has increased her offer to me by $5 total since the beginning

While Alice is gradually increasing her offers, the inflation effect continues to strengthen my position significantly. Her $55 will be worth even less to her next round, while my potential gains maintain value. The negotiation dynamic continues to favor me if we extend further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation dynamics continue to strengthen my position while weakening Alice's. In the next round, Alice would face around 24% inflation, making any amount significantly less valuable to her than to me.

Given that Alice has been gradually increasing her offers to me ($40, then $42.5, now $45), she's showing some willingness to compromise but still holding relatively firm. Her last offer of $55 for herself was worth only about $44.8 to her due to inflation.

I'll make an offer that recognizes this reality while pushing for a more favorable split:

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

This offer gives Alice $35, which even with the current inflation of around 19% is still worth about $28.5 to her. If she rejects and we go to another round where she faces 24% inflation, her bargaining position weakens further. This should provide her with a strong incentive to accept rather than continue negotiations where her potential gains lose more value with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 47.5 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $47.5 (up from her previous offers of $40, $42.5, and $45) while she would get $52.5.

Key considerations:
1. We're now in round 7
2. Alice faces 26.49% inflation, meaning her $52.5 is effectively worth only about $38.6 to her
3. I still face no inflation, so my $47.5 maintains full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer when Alice's inflation will be around 32%
5. Alice has increased her offers gradually but is still holding onto a majority share

The inflation effect continues to dramatically weaken Alice's position. She's offering me less than half despite the fact that her portion is significantly devalued by inflation. Given the strong asymmetry in our positions, I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","With each round, Alice's bargaining position weakens substantially due to inflation. At this point, she faces approximately 32% inflation in the next round, which dramatically reduces the value of any amount she would receive.

Alice has been gradually increasing her offers to me ($40, $42.5, $45, and now $47.5), showing she's feeling the pressure of inflation but still trying to maintain the majority share.

Given the significant asymmetry in our positions, I'll make a more assertive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This offer takes advantage of my strong position. For Alice, $30 with the current inflation of around 26.5% is worth about $22. If she rejects and we go to another round with 32% inflation, her potential gains would be worth even less to her. 

The rational move for Alice is to accept this offer rather than continue negotiations where her share loses substantial value with each passing round, while mine retains full value. This offer reflects the economic reality of our negotiation dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $50 (an even 50-50 split), up from her previous offers of $40, $42.5, $45, and $47.5.

Key considerations:
1. We're now in round 9
2. Alice faces 33.66% inflation, meaning her $50 is effectively worth only about $33.17 to her
3. I still face no inflation, so my $50 maintains full value
4. Alice has finally moved to an even split in nominal terms
5. In real terms (accounting for inflation), I'm getting significantly more value from this deal than Alice

Given that:
- Alice has moved to an even split
- The inflation effect has severely diminished the value of Alice's share
- The relative advantage to me is already substantial
- Further negotiation might risk a breakdown in talks

This appears to be a reasonable point to conclude negotiations.
