"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll send my offer for the first round. Given that we have 12 rounds maximum, and I need to make a fair offer that Bob would accept, I'll propose an equal split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair for both of us, giving each $500,000. This equitable division respects both our interests and avoids the risk of further rounds where inflation might affect the total value."
