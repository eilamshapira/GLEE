"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer. I want to be fair but also ensure I get a reasonable portion.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
