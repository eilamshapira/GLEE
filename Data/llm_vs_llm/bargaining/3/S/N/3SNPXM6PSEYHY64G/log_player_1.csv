"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the declining value of the money with each round. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see. Bob is being a bit aggressive. My gain is still the same, but his is worth less to him. I'll try to negotiate.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, my turn again. I need to be careful, but I also don't want to give away too much. I'll offer a slight improvement for Bob, but still prioritize myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 53,
""bob_gain"": 47
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting risky. Bob's offer isn't great for me, but his money is losing value faster. I'll reject and try to get a better deal next round, banking on his increasing loss.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, let's see if Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. I'll offer him slightly more than before, but still keep the majority.

{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is still holding out, but the inflation is really hurting him now. 44 for me isn't great, but at this point, getting something is better than nothing. I'm going to try to push for one more round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn. The inflation is getting to Bob. I'll try to get as much as I can.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 51,
""bob_gain"": 49
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the discount for Bob is really significant now. Taking 45 when he is getting so little relative to the original value seems strategically unwise. I'm going to stick to my guns and hope he folds next turn.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 9. I'm getting nervous, but Bob must be even more nervous with the inflation. I'll stick to my previous offer, hoping he finally accepts.

""alice_gain"": 51,
""bob_gain"": 49
