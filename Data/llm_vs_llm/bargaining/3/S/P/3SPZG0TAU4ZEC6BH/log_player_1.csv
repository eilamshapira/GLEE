"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but acknowledges the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since I face 10% inflation each round if we don't agree now, I need a slight advantage in this first offer to protect against that risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we need to find a compromise, considering the inflation affecting my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of $500,000 each. This is a fair and equal division that should be acceptable to both of us. Since I'm facing 10% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continue negotiating."
