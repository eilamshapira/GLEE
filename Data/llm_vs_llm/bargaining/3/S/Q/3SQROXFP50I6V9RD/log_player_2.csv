"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of an even 50-50 split. While this is a fair division at face value, I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject now and make a counteroffer next round, the total value to me will be worth 10% less (so $9,000 total value). If I want more than $5,000, I'd need to get more than $5,556 in the next round just to break even with what I'm being offered now.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of continued negotiations, Alice's initial fair offer is reasonable.
