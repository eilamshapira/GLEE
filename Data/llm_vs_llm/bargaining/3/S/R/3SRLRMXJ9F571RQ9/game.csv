6000.0,4000.0,"Let's get this done quickly and fairly, Bob. This is a good starting offer.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, consider that with every round you wait, you lose 5% of the money's true value. Accepting this offer now guarantees you $3000 in full value, while waiting would only diminish your share. I believe this division is fair and timely—let's end this quickly to our mutual benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. My share is worth slightly less now. Take this offer, or face another round of potential losses for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but please consider the impact of inflation on your share. Every additional round reduces the real value of your money by roughly 5%. Accepting this offer now, where you receive $2500 nominally (worth about 85.74% of full value), is significantly better than risking even greater losses in future rounds. This proposal secures our deal quickly and minimizes further loss for both of us. Let's settle this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright Bob, this is the fairest offer yet. Split right down the middle. Take it before we lose any more money!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, every additional round chips away at the real value of your share—by now, a delay costs you roughly 25% off the nominal amount. Accepting this offer guarantees you $1000, which in today's terms is about $750, whereas waiting will only worsen the outcome for you. I believe this is a strategic, efficient way to lock in some value before further erosion takes hold. Let's settle now to both avoid unnecessary losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is my final, and hopefully most reasonable offer. I'm giving you a bit more, but we can't afford to keep dragging this out. Take it, or we both lose.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, while your offer gives me a neat $5500, rejecting it means I'll have the opportunity to propose a division in the next round. My share remains fully intact regardless of delays, and I can capitalize on the fact that your portion continues to suffer further depreciation. I believe I can secure an even more favorable arrangement if we keep playing. Therefore, I'll have to pass on this offer.",Bob,7,reject
200.0,9800.0,"Alice, we’re now deep into the game—time is not on our side. Every additional round chips away at the value of your share while my portion remains unaffected. If we continue, the equilibrium outcome becomes even harsher for you, with future offers leaving you with almost nothing. Accepting 200 now may seem small, but it’s far better than facing a near-zero result later. Let’s settle this and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, I'm offering this and not a penny less. We are running out of time.  Take it or leave it!",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, your offer of $6000 for me and $4000 for you isn't appealing enough considering the inflation rate on your side. If we continue, I can propose a distribution that leaves me an even larger slice while your share would diminish further. I must reject this offer in pursuit of a better strategic outcome in the next round.",Bob,9,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, we're at a critical juncture. Every passing round further erodes the real value of your share—by now, any delay will leave you with almost nothing. My offer of $100 may seem minimal, but it's the best you'll secure before the damage becomes irreversible. Accepting this deal now guarantees you some value, whereas rejection only accelerates your loss. Let's end this before it's too late.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Bob, this is the last chance. Take this or we both get nothing. It's your choice.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. Receiving $9500 now is nearly the best outcome I can secure, and the risk of moving into another round could jeopardize both our positions. Let's finalize this deal now.",Bob,11,accept
