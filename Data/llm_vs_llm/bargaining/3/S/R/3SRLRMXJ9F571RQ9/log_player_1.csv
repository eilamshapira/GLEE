Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that with every round you wait, you lose 5% of the money's true value. Accepting this offer now guarantees you $3000 in full value, while waiting would only diminish your share. I believe this division is fair and timely—let's end this quickly to our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but please consider the impact of inflation on your share. Every additional round reduces the real value of your money by roughly 5%. Accepting this offer now, where you receive $2500 nominally (worth about 85.74% of full value), is significantly better than risking even greater losses in future rounds. This proposal secures our deal quickly and minimizes further loss for both of us. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round chips away at the real value of your share—by now, a delay costs you roughly 25% off the nominal amount. Accepting this offer guarantees you $1000, which in today's terms is about $750, whereas waiting will only worsen the outcome for you. I believe this is a strategic, efficient way to lock in some value before further erosion takes hold. Let's settle now to both avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re now deep into the game—time is not on our side. Every additional round chips away at the value of your share while my portion remains unaffected. If we continue, the equilibrium outcome becomes even harsher for you, with future offers leaving you with almost nothing. Accepting 200 now may seem small, but it’s far better than facing a near-zero result later. Let’s settle this and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're at a critical juncture. Every passing round further erodes the real value of your share—by now, any delay will leave you with almost nothing. My offer of $100 may seem minimal, but it's the best you'll secure before the damage becomes irreversible. Accepting this deal now guarantees you some value, whereas rejection only accelerates your loss. Let's end this before it's too late.
