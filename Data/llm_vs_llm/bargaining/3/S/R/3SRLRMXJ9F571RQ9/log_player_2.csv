"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly and fairly, Bob. This is a good starting offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that with every round you wait, you lose 5% of the money's true value. Accepting this offer now guarantees you $3000 in full value, while waiting would only diminish your share. I believe this division is fair and timely—let's end this quickly to our mutual benefit.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. My share is worth slightly less now. Take this offer, or face another round of potential losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but please consider the impact of inflation on your share. Every additional round reduces the real value of your money by roughly 5%. Accepting this offer now, where you receive $2,500 nominally (worth about 85.74% of full value), is significantly better than risking even greater losses in future rounds. This proposal secures our deal quickly and minimizes further loss for both of us. Let's settle this now.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round chips away at the real value of your share—by now, a delay costs you roughly 25% off the nominal amount. Accepting this offer guarantees you $1,000, which in today's terms is about $750, whereas waiting will only worsen the outcome for you. I believe this is a strategic, efficient way to lock in some value before further erosion takes hold. Let's settle now to both avoid unnecessary losses.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final, and hopefully most reasonable offer. I'm giving you a bit more, but we can't afford to keep dragging this out. Take it, or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer gives me a neat $5,500, rejecting it means I'll have the opportunity to propose a division in the next round. My share remains fully intact regardless of delays, and I can capitalize on the fact that your portion continues to suffer further depreciation. I believe I can secure an even more favorable arrangement if we keep playing. Therefore, I'll have to pass on this offer.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9800, ""alice_gain"": 200, ""message"": ""Alice, we’re now deep into the game—time is not on our side. Every additional round chips away at the value of your share while my portion remains unaffected. If we continue, the equilibrium outcome becomes even harsher for you, with future offers leaving you with almost nothing. Accepting 200 now may seem small, but it’s far better than facing a near-zero result later. Let’s settle this and avoid further devaluation.""}"

# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $6000 for me and $4000 for you isn't appealing enough considering the inflation rate on your side. If we continue, I can propose a distribution that leaves me an even larger slice while your share would diminish further. I must reject this offer in pursuit of a better strategic outcome in the next round.""}"

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9900, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Alice, we're at a critical juncture. Every passing round further erodes the real value of your share—by now, any delay will leave you with almost nothing. My offer of $100 may seem minimal, but it's the best you'll secure before the damage becomes irreversible. Accepting this deal now guarantees you some value, whereas rejection only accelerates your loss. Let's end this before it's too late.""}"
