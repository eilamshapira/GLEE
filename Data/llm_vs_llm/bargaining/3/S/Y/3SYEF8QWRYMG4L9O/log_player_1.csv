"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. A fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept now, my $5000 is actually worth $4750 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. To break even with Bob's current offer in the next round, I would need to get about $5263 to counteract the additional 5% inflation
4. Bob has already shown he won't accept a 60-40 split
5. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further back-and-forth, this even split is actually reasonable
