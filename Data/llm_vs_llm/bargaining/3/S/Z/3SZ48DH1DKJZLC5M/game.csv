60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and split the money reasonably. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two proposals. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation, let's try to settle this quickly with a 52/48 split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. This back and forth is only hurting us both.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split. It's a small edge for me, but it ensures we both walk away with something substantial before inflation eats away at our potential winnings.",Alice,5,
