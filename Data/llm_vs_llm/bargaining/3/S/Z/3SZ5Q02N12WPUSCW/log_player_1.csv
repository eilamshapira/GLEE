"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money equally, a fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $500,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so:
$500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 (in terms of value to me)

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me in each round, and 10% less to Bob, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

In Round 2, the value to me was 80% of the original, and now in Round 3, it's 80% * 0.8 = 64% of the original value.

For Bob, the value is 90% of the original in Round 2, and now in Round 3, it's 90% * 0.9 = 81% of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before it's too late!""}"
