1.0,9999.0,"Alice, time is money – literally. With another round, the value for you drops by 20%, while mine remains stable. I’m offering you $1 now; rejecting only leaves you with a worse deal later. Accept this fair prompt resolution and let’s settle quickly.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on me, I'm proposing $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This is a fair adjustment given the circumstances. Let's end this soon.",Alice,3,

8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, consider the depreciation: if you reject now and wait for round 5, you'll be the proposer, but your money's value will drop further to about 41% of its nominal value. By accepting my offer now, you secure a nominal $8000, which is worth roughly $4096 in real terms – exactly what you'd expect later, but without the additional delay. Let's settle now and avoid further loss.",Bob,4,
