Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money – literally. With another round, the value for you drops by 20%, while mine remains stable. I’m offering you $1 now; rejecting only leaves you with a worse deal later. Accept this fair prompt resolution and let’s settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the depreciation: if you reject now and wait for round 5, you'll be the proposer, but your money's value will drop further to about 41% of its nominal value. By accepting my offer now, you secure a nominal $8000, which is worth roughly $4096 in real terms – exactly what you'd expect later, but without the additional delay. Let's settle now and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000
