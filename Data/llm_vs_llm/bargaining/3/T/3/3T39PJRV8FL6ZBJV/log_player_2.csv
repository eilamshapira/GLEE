Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, time is money – literally. With another round, the value for you drops by 20%, while mine remains stable. I’m offering you $1 now; rejecting only leaves you with a worse deal later. Accept this fair prompt resolution and let’s settle quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on me, I'm proposing $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This is a fair adjustment given the circumstances. Let's end this soon. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the depreciation: if you reject now and wait for round 5, you'll be the proposer, but your money's value will drop further to about 41% of its nominal value. By accepting my offer now, you secure a nominal $8000, which is worth roughly $4096 in real terms – exactly what you'd expect later, but without the additional delay. Let's settle now and avoid further loss.""}"
