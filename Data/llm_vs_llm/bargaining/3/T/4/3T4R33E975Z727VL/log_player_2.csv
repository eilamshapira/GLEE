"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:
- Alice proposes a 50/50 split ($50 each)
- Due to inflation, my $50 would be worth full value now
- If I reject and we go to the next round, I would make a counter-offer, but all money would be worth 10% less to me
- The longer this negotiation goes, the more disadvantaged I become due to inflation

Given that I face 10% inflation per round and Alice doesn't, an even split now is better than potentially getting slightly more in future rounds.
