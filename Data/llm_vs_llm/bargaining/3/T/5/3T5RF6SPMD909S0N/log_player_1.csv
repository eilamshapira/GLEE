Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking by potentially facing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain and the fact that I don't want to risk losing more value in subsequent rounds, I'll accept this offer.
