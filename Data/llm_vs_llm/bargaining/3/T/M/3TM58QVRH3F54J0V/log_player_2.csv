Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but time is literally money in this game. I'm offering a compromise, let's close this deal.

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is worse than her initial offer, and the effects of inflation are starting to become significant.  I need to push for a better split."
