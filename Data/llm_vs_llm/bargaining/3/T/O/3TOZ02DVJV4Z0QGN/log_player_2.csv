"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round. But I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
2. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and more inflation

With a 50-50 split:
* If I accept now: I get $50
* If I wait one round: Even if I get more money, it will be worth 5% less to me

Since this is a fair offer and waiting will definitely cost me value due to inflation, I should accept.
