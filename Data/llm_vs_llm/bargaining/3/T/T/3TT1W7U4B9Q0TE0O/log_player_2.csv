Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2000 I would gain is actually worth $2000 * 0.64 = $1280 in real value (since it's 36% less).

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 44.8% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, combined = 20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 20% + 20% - 4% = 36%, and then another 20% less, 36% + (20% * 64%) = 36% + 12.8% = 48.8% less, but I already lost 36% in the first 2 rounds for me, so now I lose another 20%, so total is 36% + 20% = 56%, but 20% of 64% is 12.8, so 36% + 12.8% = 48.8%, I will use 48% to simplify, but actually is 48.8%  or more precisely 44.8% + 4% = 48.8%  after 3 rounds for me, so I will use 48% to simplify), and the money Alice gains is still worth the same. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the real value of the money.
