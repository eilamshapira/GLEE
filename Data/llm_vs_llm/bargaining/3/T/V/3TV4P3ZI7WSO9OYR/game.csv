5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's still a good deal for you considering the money doesn't lose value for you. Given that the money devalues for me, I would appreciate it if we can settle this quickly.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a fair split, but consider that the money is now worth 40% less for you than in round 1. I'm offering you $4500 which, if you accept now, is worth more than what you'd get in later rounds due to inflation. This 55-45 split is very reasonable given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I propose a 52-48 split in your favor. This way, you still get more, and I get a fair share considering the inflation. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for me. This is a generous offer given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
