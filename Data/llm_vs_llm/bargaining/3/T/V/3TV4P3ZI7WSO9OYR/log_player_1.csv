Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's still a good deal for you considering the money doesn't lose value for you. Given that the money devalues for me, I would appreciate it if we can settle this quickly.

# Bob gain: 5000
