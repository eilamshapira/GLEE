"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that money loses value faster for you each round, it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message:
# Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I think a more equitable split would be better. How about a 50-50 split? This way, we both get an equal share, and it's still a good deal for you considering the money doesn't lose value for you."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a fair split, but consider that the money is now worth 40% less for you than in round 1. I'm offering you $4500 which, if you accept now, is worth more than what you'd get in later rounds due to inflation. This 55-45 split is very reasonable given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message:
# Alice, I understand your perspective, but I think we can do better. How about a 52-48 split in your favor? This way, you still get more, and I get a fair share considering the inflation. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for me."
