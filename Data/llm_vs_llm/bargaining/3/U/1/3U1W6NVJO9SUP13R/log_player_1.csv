"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation that affects me. In the first round, the inflation isn't too bad, but I need to think ahead. I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself now, but still make it reasonable enough that Bob accepts.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer isn't terrible, but I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain is now only worth 90% of what it was in round 1. Let's calculate the adjusted value:

Bob's offer to me: $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 (in round 1 dollars)
Bob's gain: $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000 (in round 1 dollars)

It's still early, and I think I can get a better deal. I will reject it.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. The inflation is starting to bite. My money is worth 81% of what it was initially, so I need to factor that in. I also need to consider that Bob rejected my initial offer and made one that favors him. I will try to get a better deal but still keep it reasonable.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
