"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. My $40 now would become equivalent to $36 in the next round
5. While the split isn't exactly equal, getting $40 now might be better than risking a negotiation with inflation
