"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount. However, I can try to negotiate for a better deal, and even with a 5% inflation penalty in the next round, I'll still have room to make a counter-offer. The risk of losing everything after 12 rounds is still far away.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to increase the chances she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more balanced than Alice's initial offer
2. I'm still giving Alice a significant portion ($450,000)
3. The 55/45 split in my favor isn't so extreme that it should trigger an automatic rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has slightly improved her offer from $400,000 to $420,000
2. With 9.75% inflation, my $420,000 is actually worth about $379,050
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the next round will have even more inflation
4. We've used 3 of 12 rounds, so there's still time, but we shouldn't waste too many rounds
5. Alice's slight improvement in the offer might indicate she's willing to negotiate, but slowly

Given that the inflation is eating into the value significantly and Alice has shown only minimal movement, I think I should still reject and try one more time for a better deal, but I'll need to be more strategic in the next offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the mounting inflation pressure and Alice's previous responses, I'll make a more moderate offer that's closer to her preferences while still being advantageous for me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfectly equal split because:
1. It's completely fair and hard to argue against
2. We've already lost nearly 10% to inflation
3. Further negotiations will only reduce the real value for both of us
4. Alice has shown she wants a substantial portion, and this respects that while protecting my interests
5. A 50-50 split is often seen as the most logical solution in such negotiations"
