"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $4000 and Alice $6000. While Alice is getting more, I need to consider whether I can do better in future rounds, accounting for the fact that Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I face 0% inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject my offer too. Each round that passes, Alice's money loses 5% value, which gives me some negotiating advantage. However, we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get nothing.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that gives me a bit more while still being reasonable, considering the inflation affecting Alice's position.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I get $5500 and Alice gets $4500. This is fair considering that waiting costs Alice more than it costs me due to the 5% inflation she faces each round. I'm willing to work with you, Alice, but I think this represents a more equitable division given our different situations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from the first round, now offering me $4500 instead of $4000. However, her counter-offer still gives her more than me ($5500 vs $4500).

Since I don't face any inflation pressure, while Alice's money loses 5% value each round, my negotiating position improves over time. We're only in round 3 of 12, so I have time to negotiate for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account Alice's previous counterproposal while also considering the inflation pressure she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering a split where I get $5200 and Alice gets $4800. This is a compromise from my previous offer - I've reduced my portion by $300 compared to my last proposal. Given that Alice faces increasing inflation pressure each round (now at nearly 10%), this offer provides her more value than waiting further rounds. I believe this is a fair division that acknowledges both our positions, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon."
