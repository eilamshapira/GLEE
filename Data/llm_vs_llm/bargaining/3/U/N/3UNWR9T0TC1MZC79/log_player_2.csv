"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. The total amount to distribute is $1,000,000, and Alice is proposing I get $200,000 (20%) while she gets $800,000 (80%). This is quite imbalanced in her favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be reduced by 5% inflation for me (so worth $950,000 to me). However, I can propose a much more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging that some inflation has already occurred for me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more equitable split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money. Given that each round reduces the value by 5% for me, reaching an agreement sooner is beneficial for both of us."
