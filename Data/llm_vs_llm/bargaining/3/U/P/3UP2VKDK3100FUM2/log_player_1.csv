"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 80% of $450,000, which is $360,000 (since the money I gain is worth 20% less). 

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better split, considering the total value of the money is still significant, and Bob's offer doesn't seem to account for the disparity in inflation rates between us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and we're now in the third round, the effective value of my gain would be 64% of the original amount (80% after the first round * 80% after the second round).

To make a competitive offer while considering the inflation, I'll aim for a split that reflects the decreasing value of my potential gain but still tries to be reasonable to avoid further devaluation:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This offer slightly favors Bob, acknowledging the difference in inflation rates and the fact that the game has progressed, but it's still a negotiation tactic to find a middle ground that could satisfy both parties."
