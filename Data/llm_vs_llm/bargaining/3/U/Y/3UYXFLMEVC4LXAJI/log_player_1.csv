"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since I lose 20% value per round compared to Bob's 10%, I should ask for a bit more to offset potential future devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this 60-40 split in our favor because if Bob rejects it, both of us will lose value in the next round due to inflation, with me losing more. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the higher inflation rate I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $40, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $32
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount will be worth 40% less for me and 30% less for Bob
- Making another offer would likely lead to further devaluation, making both of us worse off

While this isn't ideal, rejecting would lead to even worse outcomes due to compounding inflation penalties. It's better to accept $32 in effective value now than risk further devaluation.
