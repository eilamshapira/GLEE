"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. While this appears fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face a 5% reduction in the money's value while Alice faces no reduction.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total amount will effectively be worth only $9,500 to me (due to 5% inflation), but still $10,000 to Alice. This puts me at a disadvantage in future negotiations.

Given this asymmetric inflation penalty, an equal split now is actually better than potentially getting slightly more in a later round after inflation.
