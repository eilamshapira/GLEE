Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a mutually beneficial split. This offer considers the inflation risk for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 5% inflation penalty, my $480,000 is worth $456,000
2. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, the inflation will reduce the value further
3. Getting a guaranteed $456,000 now is better than risking further negotiations where we might both end up with nothing
4. The split is reasonably fair considering the circumstances"
