"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for inflation risk. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully. Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's difficult to determine her strategy. However, considering the offer, it seems a bit biased towards Alice.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation effect on me, I want to make a reasonable offer to increase the chances of acceptance. I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor, but still fair.
