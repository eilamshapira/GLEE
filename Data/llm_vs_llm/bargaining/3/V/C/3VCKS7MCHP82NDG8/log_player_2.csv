"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, there's a 10% inflation penalty for me. So even if I got a better split in the next round, the money would be worth less to me.

This is a fair 50-50 split in the first round with no inflation penalty. It makes sense to accept rather than risk a worse outcome after inflation.
