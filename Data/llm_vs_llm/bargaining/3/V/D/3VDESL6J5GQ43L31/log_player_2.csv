"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer.

Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while she takes $60. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the total will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me).

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, I would need to get more than $40 out of the $95 equivalent value to make it worthwhile. While I could potentially get more in absolute dollars, the inflation penalty makes rejecting somewhat risky.

Since $40 is a reasonable share (40% of the total), and rejecting would mean facing inflation, I'll accept this offer.
