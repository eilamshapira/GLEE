55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split considering that any delay will cost me 10% in value due to inflation. If we move to another round, I lose value, so this is a reasonable offer that benefits both of us rather than prolonging the game.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Since I'm taking the risk of inflation, which reduces the value for me by 5% each round, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Let's settle this to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I see your concern about inflation on your side, but I'm facing a higher inflation rate of 10% per round compared to your 5%. Let's meet in the middle with an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us and avoids further devaluation for either party. At this point, we both benefit from concluding the negotiation now rather than continuing to lose value.",Alice,3,
