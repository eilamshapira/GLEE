"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split considering that any delay will cost me 10% in value due to inflation. If we move to another round, I lose value, so this is a reasonable offer that benefits both of us rather than prolonging the game.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I'm taking the risk of inflation, which reduces the value for me by 5% each round, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Let's settle this to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see your concern about inflation on your side, but I'm facing a higher inflation rate of 10% per round compared to your 5%. Let's meet in the middle with an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us and avoids further devaluation for either party. At this point, we both benefit from concluding the negotiation now rather than continuing to lose value.""}"
