"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'm offering you $4000 out of the $10000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000, which means she's keeping $6000 - a 40/60 split in her favor.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round when I make my offer, so my $4000 would become worth $3800. However, I would have the advantage of making the next proposal.

Given that:
1. The split is notably in Alice's favor
2. I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next round
3. The 5% loss is relatively small compared to the potential gain from a better split
4. We still have many rounds left

I think it's worth rejecting this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to encourage acceptance.

""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's still generous to you. This way we can both walk away with a good amount before inflation reduces our gains further.""}"
