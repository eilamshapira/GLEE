4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want a good outcome. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, I'm proposing a more balanced division that gives me a small advantage now to offset potential future inflation if we continue negotiating. This is fair since we don't know what inflation penalty you face, if any. I hope we can agree on this and conclude our negotiation.",Bob,2,
