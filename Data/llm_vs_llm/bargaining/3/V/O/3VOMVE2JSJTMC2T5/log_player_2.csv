"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I believe this is a good offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,000 while she takes $6,000, which isn't an equal split. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll be able to make my own proposal, but the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the total value to me would be $9,500).

Let me think about this strategically. If I counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. However, I need to consider that Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that still acknowledges the inflation factor I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want a good outcome. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, I'm proposing a more balanced division that gives me a small advantage now to offset potential future inflation if we continue negotiating. This is fair since we don't know what inflation penalty you face, if any. I hope we can agree on this and conclude our negotiation.""}"
