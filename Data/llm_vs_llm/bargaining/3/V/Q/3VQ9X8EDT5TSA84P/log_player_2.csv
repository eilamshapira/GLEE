"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I hope we can come to an agreement here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. While it's not an even split, I should keep in mind that:

1. This is just the first round
2. If I reject, we move to another round where I can make a counter-offer
3. There's 5% inflation per round for me, so waiting has a cost

Since I'd receive $400,000 now, and any delay means I'd lose 5% of whatever I eventually get, I think I can make a better counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I'm proposing a more balanced division that gives me a slight advantage since I face 5% inflation with each round. This way we can reach an agreement quickly and both benefit.""}"
