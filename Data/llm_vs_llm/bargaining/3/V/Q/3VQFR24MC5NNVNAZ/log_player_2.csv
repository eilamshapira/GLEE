"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm offering you $4000. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000, which means she's keeping $6000 for herself. This is a 40-60 split in her favor.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me next round (due to inflation)
2. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she has less pressure to accept quickly
3. We have 11 rounds remaining

Given that I'll lose 10% value each round if I reject, my $4000 now is better than potentially getting more in later rounds after inflation. While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer.
