"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob — I’m offering you $1 while I take $999,999. Since any delay costs you 10% per round, waiting only leaves you with even less. Accept this offer now to preserve what little value you’d otherwise lose.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I suggest we split the money equally. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I avoid the inflation penalty. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, it's round 3. Notice that while my share holds full value, your dollars keep devaluing as we delay, and if you wait even one more round you'll end up offering almost everything to me to get me to accept. Accepting even a minimal amount now—$1 nominal, which is worth 80 cents effective—beats the zero you’d realistically get later. I'm offering you $1, so let's just end this now before further inflation wipes out your gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your strategy, but I need to secure more value for myself. I'm offering you $100000, which is still a substantial amount. Accept this offer, and let's end the game before the money loses more value for me. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's round 5. Look, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 6, but by then the inflation will have squeezed almost all of your value—practically leaving you nothing. I’m offering you $1 nominal, which at this stage is worth about $0.66 in effective value. That’s strictly better than your expected outcome if you delay further. Accept now and we both end this costly game.""}"
