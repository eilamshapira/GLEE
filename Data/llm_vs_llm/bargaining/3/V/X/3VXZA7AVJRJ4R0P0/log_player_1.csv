"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair split with a slight advantage to me. I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests in case we need multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4,800, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $4,560 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but any future agreement will be worth even less due to continued inflation
3. The difference between my original offer and Bob's counter-offer isn't too large
4. We still have many rounds left, but waiting will only decrease the value for me

Given these factors, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
