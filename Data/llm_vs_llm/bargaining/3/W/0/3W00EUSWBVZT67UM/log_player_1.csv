"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the 10% inflation penalty per round. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives each of us an equal share of the total amount."
