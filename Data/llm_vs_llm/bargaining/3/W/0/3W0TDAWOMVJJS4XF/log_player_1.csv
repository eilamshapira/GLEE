"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 between myself (Alice) and Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of the money - $50 for me and $50 for Bob. This is the fairest division that respects both of our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
