"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's settle now to avoid any devaluation due to inflation. Do you agree?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This is still a generous offer considering we have many rounds left, and you might be affected by inflation while I'm not. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
