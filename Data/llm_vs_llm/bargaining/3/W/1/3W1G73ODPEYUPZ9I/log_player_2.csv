"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's settle now to avoid any devaluation due to inflation. Do you agree? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- Since I'm not affected by inflation, my $40 value won't decrease in future rounds
- I could propose a better split for myself in the next round
- However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds
- We have plenty of rounds left (11 more)

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This is still a generous offer considering we have many rounds left, and you might be affected by inflation while I'm not.""}"
