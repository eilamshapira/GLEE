Even though the difference is getting smaller, Bob's offer still significantly undervalues my position. I'm willing to push a bit further, given the inflation working in my favor."

This offer is getting closer to acceptable, but with the rate inflation is eating at Bob's potential gains, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer."

# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000

It's getting risky now. While not ideal, accepting ensures I get a significant portion, and Bob gets something before inflation makes his share negligible. It's the safest option at this point."
