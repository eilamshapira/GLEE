"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'll take $7,000 and you get $3,000. It's a fair offer considering I want to end the game quickly to avoid inflation impacts on my end. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your quick move in round 1. However, to avoid further inflation and ensure a timely conclusion, I propose that I receive $4000 and you receive $6000. I believe this split fairly reflects our mutual interests in closing the game quickly. Letâ€™s seal the deal in round 2 before any additional value is lost. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
