Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'll take $7000 and you get $3000. It's a fair offer considering I want to end the game quickly to avoid inflation impacts on my end. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your quick move in round 1. However, to avoid further inflation and ensure a timely conclusion, I propose that I receive $4000 and you receive $6000. I believe this split fairly reflects our mutual interests in closing the game quickly. Letâ€™s seal the deal in round 2 before any additional value is lost.""}"
