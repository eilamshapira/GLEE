"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a standard Ultimatum Game scenario, but with the added element of inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee Alice would offer me a better deal in a future round. Accepting a guaranteed $50 now is a safe and rational choice."
