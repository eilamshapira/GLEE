"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both myself and Bob. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll try to be reasonable while still securing a decent portion for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer considering the inflation.

*   **Bob's Offer:** $5000 for me, $5000 for him.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 10% less, Bob's is worth 5% less compared to Round 1.

This means my $5000 in round 2 is worth $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 in round 1 terms. Bob's $5000 is worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 in round 1 terms.

I need to decide if getting the equivalent of $4500 now is better than potentially getting more (but worth even less) in a later round. Given the rapid inflation, accepting might be the best strategy.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
