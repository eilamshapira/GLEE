"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. Accepting now avoids future rounds where my share would depreciate by 20% each round. Let's settle quickly so we both secure as much value as possible.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a fairer split. Since my share doesn't depreciate, I'm willing to offer you a significant amount, but I also expect a reasonable share for myself. Accepting this offer ensures you get a good value before any further potential depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I'll accept your offer. Even though my money is depreciated by 20% in round 2, 45 dollars now is better than waiting a further round where my share gets reduced even further. Let's settle and avoid additional depreciation!""}"
