"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. Accepting now avoids future rounds where my share would depreciate by 20% each round. Let's settle quickly so we both secure as much value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $40 and Alice $60, and considering that with each passing round the money is worth 0% less for me (meaning its value doesn't change for me, but potentially does for Alice), I should evaluate if this initial split is favorable or not.

Given that I don't know the inflation effect on Alice but she mentions her share would depreciate by 20% each round, it suggests she values quick resolution to preserve her share's value. However, for me, the value remains constant.

The initial offer of $40 for me and $60 for Alice is not equally split, but considering the game's dynamics and the potential for Alice's share to depreciate, I should think about the strategic advantage of accepting early versus the potential for a better offer later.

However, since the money doesn't depreciate for me, and I have 12 rounds to negotiate, I might be able to get a better deal by waiting, especially if Alice's share depreciates as she mentioned.

Therefore, my decision is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the game's dynamics and the fact that the money doesn't depreciate for me, I'll aim for a more equal split, but also taking into account that Alice might be under pressure due to her share's potential depreciation.

My offer is: 
{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's aim for a fairer split. Since my share doesn't depreciate, I'm willing to offer you a significant amount, but I also expect a reasonable share for myself. Accepting this offer ensures you get a good value before any further potential depreciation.""}"
