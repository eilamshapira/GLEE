"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division where I get a bit more than half, but not too much to discourage Alice from accepting.
