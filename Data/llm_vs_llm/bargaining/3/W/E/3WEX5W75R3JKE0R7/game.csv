500000.0,500000.0,Let's start with a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share right away without risking inflation reducing our gains in later rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but it accounts for the greater impact of inflation on you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
530000.0,470000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but that's precisely why I need a slightly larger share. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor to compensate for this difference. This way, we can finish early and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I see your concern about inflation, but I need to secure more for myself as well. Let's settle for a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a good amount, considering the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly reducing our potential gains. At this point, my money has lost nearly 50% of its value while yours has lost about 27%. Given this disparity, I'm proposing a 58-42 split in my favor to account for the difference in our inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement now before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
