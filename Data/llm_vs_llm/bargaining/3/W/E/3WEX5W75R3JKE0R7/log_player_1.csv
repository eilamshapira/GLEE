Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but it accounts for the greater impact of inflation on you.
