This way, we both still get a significant amount, but it accounts for the greater impact of inflation on you.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but that's precisely why I need a slightly larger share. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor to compensate for this difference. This way, we can finish early and both walk away with substantial amounts.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly reducing our potential gains. At this point, my money has lost nearly 50% of its value while yours has lost about 27%. Given this disparity, I'm proposing a 58-42 split in my favor to account for the difference in our inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement now before we both lose more value.

# Alice gain: 580000
