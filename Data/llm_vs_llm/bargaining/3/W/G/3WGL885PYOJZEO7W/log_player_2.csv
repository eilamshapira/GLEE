"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1 out of $1,000,000. Even with the 20% inflation penalty for the next round, I would be better off making a counter-proposal. When it's my turn to propose, I can suggest a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable here. I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Remember, if you reject this, the money will be worth less in the next round due to inflation. This is a win-win proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40, but this is my final offer.  If you reject this, we'll both end up with less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 36% inflation penalty affecting my share, $400,000 now is better than risking another round where I'd face even more inflation. Additionally, this is a relatively fair split considering the circumstances, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise from her initial extremely unfair offer. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking further depreciation of my share in subsequent rounds."
