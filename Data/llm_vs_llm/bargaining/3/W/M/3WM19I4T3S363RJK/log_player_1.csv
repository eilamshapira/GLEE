"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start the negotiation with a fair offer that accounts for the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm offering you $525,000 while Bob gets $475,000. This slightly favors me to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. It's a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial amount."
