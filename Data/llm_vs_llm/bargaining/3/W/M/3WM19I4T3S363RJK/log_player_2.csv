"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $475,000 while she gets $525,000. This is close to a 50-50 split, with Alice taking just 5% more.

If I reject this and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the entire $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me. My counter-offer would need to secure me more than $475,000 after accounting for this inflation.

Since Alice's offer is reasonably fair and the inflation risk is significant, I'll accept.
