Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the cost of waiting and our respective devaluation rates, I propose a fair split: Iâ€™ll take $35 and you get $65. This deal reflects our future expectations and avoids further losses from delay. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
