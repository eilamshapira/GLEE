"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation effect I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering I'll face 5% inflation each round if we don't agree now, which would reduce the value of my share over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that we both want a slight advantage. Let me propose a fair compromise given the inflation we're both facing.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and considering that both of us are facing inflation with each passing round (5% for me, 10% for you), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
