"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. It's a fair way to kick off our negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an equal split of $5,000 each, which is fair at face value. Since there's no inflation for me, my $5,000 maintains its full value regardless of which round we settle in. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could be relevant for negotiation strategy.

While I could reject and counter-offer in hopes of getting more, there's risk in prolonged negotiation - if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. An equal split is objectively fair, and accepting now guarantees me $5,000.
