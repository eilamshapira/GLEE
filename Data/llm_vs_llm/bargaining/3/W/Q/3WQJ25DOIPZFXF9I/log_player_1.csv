Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we delay further, you'll lose 20% per round while I lose only 5%. In round 3 you’d be the proposer, but your money’s value would drop to 60% of the face value. To avoid these heavy future depreciation losses for you, I’m proposing a 70/30 split now. Accepting this offer ensures you get $300000 at current terms before further devaluation hits. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

# Bob gain: 700000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay further hurts you more than me: while I lose only 5% per round, your share drops by 20%. By accepting my offer now in round 4, you'll secure $250000 before your money devalues further to about 51% of its original value. If you reject and become the proposer in round 5, the continuing depreciation will force you into a tougher spot, and even a generous proposal may leave you with less in real terms. I believe this offer—allocating $750000 to me and $250000 to you—is in both our best interests given the inflation penalty. Let’s cut the losses now and agree before the depreciation erodes our earnings even more.

I'll propose $350,000 for me and $650,000 for you. This division considers your previous offers while giving me a bit more balance against my depreciation. Let's settle this amicably here.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 6, the depreciation gap widens: my share is discounted by about 22.6% (77.4% of original value) while yours is hit much harder at roughly 67.2% depreciation (only 32.8% of its face value remains). By accepting my proposal of a $664000 to me and $336000 to you split, you secure a face value that translates to roughly $110000 effective value in this round. If you reject and delay to round 7, your effective amount will be even lower—given your 20% drop each round—forcing you into a less favorable position. I believe this division better safeguards your interests in light of severe depreciation and is our best move towards a resolution. 
# Alice gain: 336000 
# Bob gain: 664000
