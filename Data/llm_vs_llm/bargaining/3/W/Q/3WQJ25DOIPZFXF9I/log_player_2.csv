"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair with an equal split of $500000 each so we both maximize our gains before depreciation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, if we delay further, you'll lose 20% per round while I lose only 5%. In round 3 you’d be the proposer, but your money’s value would drop to 60% of the face value. To avoid these heavy future depreciation losses for you, I’m proposing a 70/30 split now. Accepting this offer ensures you get $300,000 at current terms before further devaluation hits. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's strike a deal where I take $400000 and you get $600000. This way, you still come out ahead, and I mitigate some of my loss. It's a better compromise that respects your position and minimizes my depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Alice, every round we delay further hurts you more than me: while I lose only 5% per round, your share drops by 20%. By accepting my offer now in round 4, you'll secure $250,000 before your money devalues further to about 51% of its original value. If you reject and become the proposer in round 5, the continuing depreciation will force you into a tougher spot, and even a generous proposal may leave you with less in real terms. I believe this offer—allocating $750,000 to me and $250,000 to you—is in both our best interests given the inflation penalty. Let’s cut the losses now and agree before the depreciation erodes our earnings even more.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the depreciation concern, but let's find a middle ground. I'll propose $350000 for me and $650000 for you. This division considers your previous offers while giving me a bit more balance against my depreciation. Let's settle this amicably here. 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 664000, ""alice_gain"": 336000, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 6, the depreciation gap widens: my share is discounted by about 22.6% (77.4% of original value) while yours is hit much harder at roughly 67.2% depreciation (only 32.8% of its face value remains). By accepting my proposal of a $664,000 to me and $336,000 to you split, you secure a face value that translates to roughly $110,000 effective value in this round. If you reject and delay to round 7, your effective amount will be even lower—given your 20% drop each round—forcing you into a less favorable position. I believe this division better safeguards your interests in light of severe depreciation and is our best move towards a resolution.""}"
