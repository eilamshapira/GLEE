"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for future rounds and inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to assess Bob's offer.

Here's how I'll think about it:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 5% less this round.
*   **Offer:** I get $4500.

Given the situation, I'll make my decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
