"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we should consider our different discount rates. Since your money is worth 10% less next round and mine only 5% less, this 55-45 split is actually fair. If we go to another round, we both lose more value. This way we both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
