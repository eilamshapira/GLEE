"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take a little more since I'm playing! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor, giving me $40 and herself $60. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, my money would be worth 5% less, and Alice's would be worth 10% less. That means in the next round, we'd be effectively dividing $95 from my perspective and $90 from Alice's perspective.

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and Alice faces a steeper discount rate than I do, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different discount rates while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I think we should consider our different discount rates. Since your money is worth 10% less next round and mine only 5% less, this 55-45 split is actually fair. If we go to another round, we both lose more value. This way we both walk away with a good deal.""}"
