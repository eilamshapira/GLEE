"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 to me in the next round

Even if I make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round, the 20% inflation penalty means I would need to get significantly more just to break even with the current offer. Alice also knows this and might use it against me in future negotiations.

$400,000 is a substantial amount, and while it's less than Alice's share, securing this amount now is better than risking a lower effective value in future rounds due to inflation.
