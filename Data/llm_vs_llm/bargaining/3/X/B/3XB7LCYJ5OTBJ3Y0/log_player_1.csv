"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonably fair offer that gives me a slight advantage, acknowledging that Bob has the power to reject and counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

My proposal is that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000, which is a 55-45 split. This gives me a modest advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk further rounds."
