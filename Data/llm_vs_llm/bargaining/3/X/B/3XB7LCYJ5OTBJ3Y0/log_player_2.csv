"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. With a 20% inflation penalty per round for me, if I reject and go to round 2, the total value would be worth only $800,000 to me. My counter-proposal could get me more, but also risks further negotiations and inflation.
