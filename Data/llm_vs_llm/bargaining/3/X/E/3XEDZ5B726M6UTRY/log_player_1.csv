"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split, but this time in my favor.  Fair is fair, and we both lose money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. For me, it will be worth 20% less again, and for Bob, it will be worth 10% less.

Given the options, I think it's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the original $10,000 is now worth:

* For me: $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400 (20% less in each of the two rounds)
* For Bob: $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100 (10% less in each of the two rounds)

I'll make a new offer, trying to balance the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the decreasing value""}"
