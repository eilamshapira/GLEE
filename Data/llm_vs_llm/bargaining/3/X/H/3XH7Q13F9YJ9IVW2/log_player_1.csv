"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a strong initial offer since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round while Bob isn't. A fair split would be in my favor to account for this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a reasonable offer considering I lose value each round."
