"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm Alice and inflation impacts me more severely (20% vs 5% per round), I should make a reasonable first offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and waiting will hurt me more than Bob due to higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $45, but with 20% inflation = $36 real value
   * Bob gets $55, but with 5% inflation = $52.25 real value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but my gains will be worth 40% less than original
   * Bob's gains will be worth 10% less than original
   * Waiting another round significantly deteriorates my position

Given that my inflation rate is much higher (20% vs 5%), and the offer gives me a reasonable share considering inflation, I should accept this offer. Waiting further rounds will only weaken my position more dramatically than Bob's.
