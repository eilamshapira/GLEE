"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the value I bring. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be reduced by 20% due to inflation on my end, meaning we'd only be dividing 80$ from my perspective.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I were to ask for the entire 80$ (which Alice would likely reject), I'd be worse off than taking the $40 now. And any fair counter-offer would give me less than $40 after inflation.
