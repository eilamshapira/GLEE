"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Starting Strong:** I'm offering a slightly favorable split to myself to establish a good starting point.
*   **Fair Enough:** I believe Bob will find 4500 a reasonable amount, especially considering it's the first round.
*   **Inflation Awareness:** I need to secure a decent amount early on due to the inflation effect on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation update.

Let's analyze:

*   **My Inflation:** My money is now worth 5% less.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 10% less.
*   **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering me $4500.

Considering the inflation and the fact that we have a limited number of rounds, I will accept Bob's offer. Even with the 5% reduction in value for me, $4500 is a decent amount to secure at this stage.
