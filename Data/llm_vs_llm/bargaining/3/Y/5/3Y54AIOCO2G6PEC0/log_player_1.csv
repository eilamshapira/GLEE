"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept early.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, Bob gets a slightly larger share, which might motivate him to accept the offer and end the game early, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 to me.

Considering Bob's offer gives us an equal split, but taking into account the devaluation, I think this is a fair offer, especially since the devaluation will only get worse for both of us in subsequent rounds.
