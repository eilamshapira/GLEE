"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that future rounds will decrease the value by 20% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

With this proposal, I aim to secure a slightly larger share since waiting for future rounds would reduce the money's value for me due to inflation. The split is still reasonably fair, giving Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation
   * Real value for me = $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * The money will be worth another 20% less for me
   * Even if I propose a better split, the inflation will eat into my gains
   * Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given that waiting another round would decrease the value even further for me, and Bob's offer still gives me a substantial amount even after inflation, I should accept this offer.
