Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split which is truly fair. Note that inflation hurts me more than you (20% vs 10% per round), so we both benefit from agreeing quickly. This equal division respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
