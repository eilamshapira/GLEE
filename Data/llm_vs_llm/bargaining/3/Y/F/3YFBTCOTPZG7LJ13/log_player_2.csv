"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to give you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value of money for both of us with each round, and mine decreases faster (20% vs 10%). Let me reject this initial offer since I believe I can get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split which is truly fair. Note that inflation hurts me more than you (20% vs 10% per round), so we both benefit from agreeing quickly. This equal division respects both our interests.""}"
