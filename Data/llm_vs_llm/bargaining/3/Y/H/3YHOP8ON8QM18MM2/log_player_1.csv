"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me, so you're better off accepting early rather than waiting for later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering we're still in the early rounds, I think an equal split is fair. The inflation hasn't had a drastic effect yet, and this way we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Bob, inflation affects you at 20% per round while only affecting me at 10%. Let's calculate: for you, waiting another round means your money is worth 20% less, so this 40% now is better than rejecting and getting even less real value later. For both our sakes, let's finalize now before inflation eats away more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept less than half yet. Since you're also losing value with each round, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. This offer is slightly in my favor, but it's still a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5 and inflation is seriously affecting both of us, but you much more severely. Your money has already lost almost 50% of its value, while mine has lost about 27%. Let's be rational - if you reject this offer, by the next round your share will be worth even less in real terms. This offer of 38% now is worth more to you than 50% would be in later rounds due to the 20% inflation rate you're facing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know inflation is taking a toll, but I'm not ready to give up on an equal split yet. Considering we're already halfway through the rounds, I'm hoping you'll see the value in settling now rather than risking further losses. This is my last attempt at an equal split - if you reject, I'll have to reassess my strategy.

# Bob gain: 50
