600000.0,400000.0,"Hey Bob, let's make this quick and fair for both of us. I propose I take $600000 and you take $400000. We both win by ending it quickly before inflation affects us!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. I'm proposing $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation. If we go another round, the total value decreases for me, and potentially for you too. Let's finish this now with a reasonable agreement.",Bob,2,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hey Bob, I understand your concern for a balanced split. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This way, we both gain, and we can end it before any more inflation affects us. What do you think?",Alice,3,
