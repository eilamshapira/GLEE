Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. I'm proposing $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation. If we go another round, the total value decreases for me, and potentially for you too. Let's finish this now with a reasonable agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
