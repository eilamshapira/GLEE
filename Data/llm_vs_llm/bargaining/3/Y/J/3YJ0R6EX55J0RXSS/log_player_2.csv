"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this quick and fair for both of us. I propose I take $600000 and you take $400000. We both win by ending it quickly before inflation affects us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation (so only $900,000 of value from my perspective).

If I accept now, I get $400,000.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'd be working with a pot that's effectively worth $900,000 to me.

I think I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, so:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split that acknowledges both the inflation factor and the need for fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. I'm proposing $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation. If we go another round, the total value decreases for me, and potentially for you too. Let's finish this now with a reasonable agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand your concern for a balanced split. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This way, we both gain, and we can end it before any more inflation affects us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $520,000, which is more favorable than her first offer. Due to the 19% inflation on my side, this $520,000 is worth about $421,200 in terms of the original value (compared to the $400,000 she initially offered).

If I reject and we go to another round, my inflation will increase further to 29% (10% more), and I would need to propose an even higher amount for myself to maintain the same value.

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward a fairer split, and considering the accelerating inflation effect, this appears to be a reasonable offer. The $520,000 she's offering me is now a majority of the money, and the inflation effect makes accepting now advantageous.
