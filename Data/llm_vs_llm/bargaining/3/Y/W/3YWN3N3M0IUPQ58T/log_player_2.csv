"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's wrap this up quickly. I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, you get a nice chunk before inflation hits harder. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * My money will be worth 20% less (significant drop)
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less (smaller impact)
   * This gives Alice stronger negotiating power in later rounds

Given that:
* The inflation rate affects me much more severely (20% vs 5%)
* $40 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later but worth much less
* Alice's offer is reasonable considering she made the first move
* Further negotiation would likely lead to worse outcomes due to the asymmetric inflation
