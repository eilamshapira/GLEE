Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is now $950,000 (1,000,000 * 0.95). However, for the sake of the proposal, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's adjust the split to 55-45 in my favor. This considers the increasing risk and inflation for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the amount I'm willing to accept has changed, but I'll make an offer based on the original $1,000,000 for simplicity.

Given that Alice's share devalues faster, I might have an advantage in waiting, but I also risk losing more value over time.
