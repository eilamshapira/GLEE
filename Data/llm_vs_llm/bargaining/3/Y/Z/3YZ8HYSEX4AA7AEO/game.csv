0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, in recognition of the fact that waiting only hurts my share (as my money value diminishes by 20% each round), I'm offering you the entire $10000 right now. I realize that if you wait, you can structure an offer in your favor in later rounds, so to save time and avoid further complications, I propose this immediate agreement. I hope you accept this proposal and we can end the game swiftly.",Alice,1,
