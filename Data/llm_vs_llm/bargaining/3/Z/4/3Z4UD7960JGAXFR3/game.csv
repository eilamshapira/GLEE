600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face 10% inflation each round while you don't. If we delay, my share will be worth less, while yours maintains value. Let's make a deal now!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that actually strengthens my position. Since your money loses 10% value each round, we should reach an agreement soon. But that means I should get more, not less. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because your declining bargaining position due to inflation is already factored in. Let's make this deal now so you don't lose more value.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm compromising from my initial offer, proposing a 55-45 split. Remember, my share is already worth less due to 20% cumulative inflation so far. My $550000 is effectively worth only $440000 to me now. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different situations.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Let's continue this momentum. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that with each round, your share loses value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. Your $450000 now is better than a larger number later with more inflation impact. We're halfway to a fair 50-50 split from our original positions, and this proposal acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's make this deal and avoid the risk of getting nothing.",Bob,4,
