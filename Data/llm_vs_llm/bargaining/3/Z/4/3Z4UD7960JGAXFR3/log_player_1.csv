""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face 10% inflation each round while you don't. If we delay, my share will be worth less, while yours maintains value. Let's make a deal now!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that actually strengthens my position. Since your money loses 10% value each round, we should reach an agreement soon. But that means I should get more, not less. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because your declining bargaining position due to inflation is already factored in. Let's make this deal now so you don't lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation pressure is precisely why I deserve a larger share. While Bob's money maintains its value, my share loses 10% each round. Bob is trying to use this against me, but it actually justifies my initial proposal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm compromising from my initial offer, proposing a 55-45 split. Remember, my share is already worth less due to 20% cumulative inflation so far. My $550,000 is effectively worth only $440,000 to me now. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different situations.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Let's continue this momentum. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that with each round, your share loses value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. Your $450000 now is better than a larger number later with more inflation impact. We're halfway to a fair 50-50 split from our original positions, and this proposal acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's make this deal and avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation impact is becoming significant, and Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances. My $450,000 is already worth only about $328,000 due to the 27.1% inflation, and waiting longer will only decrease its value further. While I might be able to negotiate for a slightly better nominal amount, the time value loss would likely offset any gains. Better to secure this deal now than risk further depreciation or, worse, both of us getting nothing."
