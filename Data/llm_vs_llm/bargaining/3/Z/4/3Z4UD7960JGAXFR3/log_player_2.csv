"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face 10% inflation each round while you don't. If we delay, my share will be worth less, while yours maintains value. Let's make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

It's true that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation. However, this inflation only affects her, not me. If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer. Since Alice faces inflation, her bargaining position weakens as rounds progress, which actually gives me more leverage.

Given that I can make the next offer and her money will be worth 10% less next round, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split for myself.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while acknowledging Alice's inflation concern but using it to justify a better deal for me.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that actually strengthens my position. Since your money loses 10% value each round, we should reach an agreement soon. But that means I should get more, not less. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because your declining bargaining position due to inflation is already factored in. Let's make this deal now so you don't lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm compromising from my initial offer, proposing a 55-45 split. Remember, my share is already worth less due to 20% cumulative inflation so far. My $550000 is effectively worth only $440000 to me now. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's now proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000.

She's right that her share is worth less to her due to inflation, but this actually strengthens my negotiating position. If we continue to later rounds, her money will be worth even less to her, potentially giving me leverage for a better deal.

However, I should also consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and we're already in round 3. If we fail to reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Alice has moved from a 60-40 split to a 55-45 split in her favor. This is movement in my direction, but I believe I can still get a better deal given the inflation pressure on her side.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Let's continue this momentum. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that with each round, your share loses value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. Your $450,000 now is better than a larger number later with more inflation impact. We're halfway to a fair 50-50 split from our original positions, and this proposal acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's make this deal and avoid the risk of getting nothing.""}"
