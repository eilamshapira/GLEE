"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to Bob, recognizing that with 5% inflation per round for me, I have some incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, we both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. This is a reasonable offer that allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation will affect both of us, so let's not risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
