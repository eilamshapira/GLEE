"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, we both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. This is a reasonable offer that allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
