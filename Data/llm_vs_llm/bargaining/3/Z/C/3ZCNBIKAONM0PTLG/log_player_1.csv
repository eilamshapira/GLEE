Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60/40, but I think it's fairer for me to get the larger share since I'm taking the risk of having to make the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
