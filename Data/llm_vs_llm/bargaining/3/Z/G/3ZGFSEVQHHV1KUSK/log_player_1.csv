"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation effect. Since Bob experiences 5% inflation per round, it's in his interest to accept an offer sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000. Bob gets $5,000 and I get $5,000. This is an equitable division that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I propose a division where Bob gets $5,500 and I get $4,500. This offer gives Bob a larger share than what I initially proposed, acknowledging that we're now in round 3. However, it's still better for me than Bob's previous offer. Since Bob faces 5% inflation each round, it's rational for him to accept this offer now rather than continuing to negotiate."
