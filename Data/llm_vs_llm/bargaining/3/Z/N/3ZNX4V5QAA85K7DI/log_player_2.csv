"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, a little more for me since I'm proposing. Quick decision prevents loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which is a 45-45-10 split
2. The inflation doesn't affect me, so I don't lose value by rejecting
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. There are still 11 rounds left, so plenty of room to negotiate
5. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer since I can likely negotiate a more favorable split, and I don't face any inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can be patient. I propose we switch the numbers from your previous offer - this is still a fair split, just slightly in my favor.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It mirrors Alice's previous offer but in my favor
2. I remind Alice that inflation doesn't affect me, strengthening my negotiating position
3. The split is still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid inflation losses
4. If Alice rejects, I still have many rounds to negotiate"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard. I need a larger share this round to account for the loss. Let's close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me $400,000, which is less than her first offer
2. She's asking for more ($600,000) citing inflation
3. While her share is worth 36% less to her, that's her problem, not mine
4. My money maintains its value, so I don't need to rush
5. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate
6. This offer is worse for me than the first one, and I don't face any inflation pressure

Since I'm not affected by inflation and this offer is less favorable than the first one, I'll reject it. I can continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Given that I'm immune to inflation, I have a strong negotiating position. However, I'm still offering you a substantial amount that, even with the current inflation, is worth more than waiting several more rounds for a larger nominal amount. Let's conclude this deal now.""}

My strategy here is:
1. I'm increasing my demand because my position is getting stronger
2. I clearly explain why Alice should accept - any later deal would need to be much larger to compensate for increasing inflation
3. The offer is firm but not extreme - Alice still gets a significant amount
4. I'm showing I understand the inflation dynamics while leveraging my advantageous position
5. If Alice rejects, I can still adjust in future rounds, but the inflation pressure on her side will only increase"
