"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation factor affecting Bob's valuation of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait. My offer gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slight advantage in the negotiation due to the asymmetric inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the continued inflation for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth even less to him due to the 20% inflation per round. If we continue to later rounds, his position weakens. This offer gives him a better deal than my first proposal and is quite fair considering the circumstances. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that we're getting deeper into the negotiation, and the inflation impact on Bob's side is becoming more significant. Let me make an offer that acknowledges this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly equal split of the money. Given that we're now in round 5 and Bob's money has already lost significant value due to inflation, this 50-50 split is actually quite favorable to him compared to waiting for later rounds. It's a fair compromise that should allow us to conclude this negotiation."
