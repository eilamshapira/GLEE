6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you face a 5% inflation penalty each round while I don't. If we delay, your share becomes worth less to you. Let's make a deal now so you get the full value of your share.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty I face, I'm willing to make a deal, but I think 60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which I believe is more reasonable. Let's settle this before the inflation takes a bigger toll on my share.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need a better deal than 45%. I'm meeting you halfway from my initial proposal with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given your inflation penalty - if we go another round, your 4500 will effectively be worth only 4275 to you. Let's reach an agreement now to maximize both our outcomes.",Alice,3,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but I still think 55/45 in your favor is too much. Given the inflation penalty, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split. This way, we both get a decent share, and I minimize my losses due to inflation. Let's make a deal before it gets worse for me.",Bob,4,

5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm now offering exactly what you proposed but reversed - 52.5/47.5 in my favor. With the ongoing inflation, if we go another round, your 4750 will be worth about 4512 to you. This is our best chance to reach a fair agreement that acknowledges both the inflation pressure you face and a reasonable split for both of us.",Alice,5,
