"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the fact that he has more pressure to accept a deal sooner due to his 5% inflation penalty per round.

""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you face a 5% inflation penalty each round while I don't. If we delay, your share becomes worth less to you. Let's make a deal now so you get the full value of your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty I face, I'm willing to make a deal, but I think 60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which I believe is more reasonable. Let's settle this before the inflation takes a bigger toll on my share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need a better deal than 45%. I'm meeting you halfway from my initial proposal with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given your inflation penalty - if we go another round, your 4500 will effectively be worth only 4275 to you. Let's reach an agreement now to maximize both our outcomes.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but I still think 55/45 in your favor is too much. Given the inflation penalty, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split. This way, we both get a decent share, and I minimize my losses due to inflation. Let's make a deal before it gets worse for me. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm now offering exactly what you proposed but reversed - 52.5/47.5 in my favor. With the ongoing inflation, if we go another round, your 4750 will be worth about 4512 to you. This is our best chance to reach a fair agreement that acknowledges both the inflation pressure you face and a reasonable split for both of us.""}"
