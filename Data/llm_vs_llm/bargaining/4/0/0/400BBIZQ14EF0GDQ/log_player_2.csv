"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation, which affects me more heavily than you (20% vs 5% per round). 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to consider my own interests as well. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share while minimizing the effects of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering my much higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%). If we continue negotiating, we both lose more value. Let's conclude this now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point, but I think a 52-48 split in my favor is more balanced given the inflation rates. We're both affected, and this split reflects that while ensuring we both get a good share.""}"
