"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the offer, I need to decide. Let's break it down:

*   **My perspective (Alice):**
    *   Original offer: $600,000 (worth 100%)
    *   My money now worth: 1,000,000 \* 0.80 = $800,000
    *   Bob's offer: $350,000

I should compare the values to the 800,000.
350,000 < 800,000

*   **My decision:** Reject.
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's round 3. The money is worth less for both of us now.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):**
    *   Original offer: $600,000 (worth 100%)
    *   My money now worth: 1,000,000 \* (1 - 0.488) = $512,000
    *   Bob's offer: $440,000

I should compare the values to the 512,000.
440,000 < 512,000

*   **My decision:** Reject.
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
