"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. I believe this is fair considering that we both face diminishing returns with each round, but you face a steeper decline (20% vs my 10%)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the ongoing inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm moving toward a more balanced split. Since we're now in round 3, inflation has reduced the value for both of us, so reaching an agreement becomes more urgent. This 55-45 split acknowledges both our interests while still accounting for the different inflation rates we face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer taking into account the increasing inflation impacts.

{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests. At this point, we've both lost significant value due to inflation - my gains are worth about 34% less than in round 1, while Bob's are worth about 59% less. This 53-47 split acknowledges that we need to reach an agreement soon, as continued negotiation is costly for both of us, but especially for Bob."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the severe inflation effects at this point.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. We're now in round 7, and the inflation has significantly devalued our potential gains - mine by about 47% and Bob's by about 74% compared to round 1. At this stage, it's becoming critical that we reach an agreement. This equal division represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both our interests while recognizing the urgency of concluding our negotiation."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering we're now in round 9 with significant inflation impacts.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in Bob's favor. At this point, inflation has reduced my potential gain by about 57% and Bob's by about 83% from round 1. We're running out of rounds, and it's becoming extremely costly for both of us to continue negotiating, especially for Bob. This offer acknowledges that Bob needs a larger nominal amount to compensate for his higher inflation rate, while still allowing me to receive a reasonable amount."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering we're now in round 11 with severe inflation impacts.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I propose a 40-60 split in Bob's favor. We're now at round 11 out of 12 possible rounds. The inflation has dramatically reduced the value - my potential gain is worth about 65% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth about 89% less. If we don't reach an agreement in the next round, we both get nothing. This offer gives Bob a larger nominal amount to offset his higher inflation rate, while still allowing me to receive a reasonable portion given the circumstances."
