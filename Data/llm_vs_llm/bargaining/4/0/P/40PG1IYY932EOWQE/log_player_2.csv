"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my $5000 would only be worth $4000 in the next round
4. Even if I make a more aggressive proposal next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky

Given that it's a fair initial offer and the inflation penalty would significantly reduce my gains in future rounds, I should accept.
