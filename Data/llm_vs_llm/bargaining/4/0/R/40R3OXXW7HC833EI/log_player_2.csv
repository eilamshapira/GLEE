"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 69.15, ""alice_gain"": 30.85, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject my offer, you'll be the proposer next round but due to the discounting you'll end up with about $34.28 nominal—which is worth roughly $30.85 today. I’m offering you exactly that amount to ensure we both avoid further losses. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer was too low. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your proposal; however, given the discounting, I’d rather wait and make my own offer in the next round. Thank you for understanding.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 10, ""alice_gain"": 90, ""message"": ""Alice, here's my proposal: I take $10 and you get $90. In round 4 the dollar’s worth is discounted by 27.1% (0.9³ ≈ 0.729), so the effective value of your $90 is about $65.61. This is exactly what you could expect if you waited until round 5 as the proposer, where, despite controlling the split, you’d face further discounting. Any delay now only deepens the loss in value. I believe this offer balances our interests given the inflation, so I hope you accept it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was much better but still undervalues my position in the early rounds. Let's split the difference - I propose 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the proposal. However, with the current discount, the $30 I'm offered is effectively worth about $19.68 in round‐1 dollars. If I reject and become the proposer in round 6, despite further discounting, I can secure a more favorable share by leveraging my next-move advantage. For these reasons, I must decline your 70/30 split.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 77.81, ""alice_gain"": 22.19, ""message"": ""Alice, let’s consider our remaining rounds. If you reject my offer now in round 6, you become the proposer in round 7. Working backwards from the final round, the equilibrium outcome in round 7 would guarantee you a nominal value of about 24.66. Discounting that by 10% (since one extra round means a 0.9 factor), your continuation value would be roughly 22.19. Therefore, I’m offering you exactly $22.19 now, which is equivalent to what you’d secure later in the best‐rational equilibrium outcome. Given the rapid discounting of the total pie, this is a fair and optimal division. What do you say?""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm sticking with a 60/40 split.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but let's look at the numbers. With 6 rounds remaining (including this round), the equilibrium outcome (by backward induction with a discount factor of 0.9 per round) implies that as the responder I should expect roughly 75.34% of the pie in nominal terms if I reject your offer. Your 60/40 split gives me only $40 nominal, far below that level. Therefore, I must reject this offer, as waiting will secure me a more advantageous share.""}"

Round 8

In that round, based on backward induction, you could secure around $18.10 nominally. However, discounting one round (multiplying by 0.9) reduces that to roughly $16.29 in today's terms. To maintain fairness and efficiency given the inflation, I’m offering you exactly $16.29, allowing me to keep $83.71. I believe this outcome reflects our best equilibrium position.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you 45 - my last offer was more generous!  Accept this, or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you’d like to end this quickly, but let’s look at the numbers. Your current offer awards me a nominal $45 in round 9. However, because money is worth only about 43% of its round‐1 value now (0.9⁸ ≈ 0.4305), that $45 is effectively worth only about $19.37 in round‐1 dollars. If I reject your offer, I'll become the proposer in round 10. In that position—despite even heavier discounting—I can structure an offer that, according to backward‐induction, would secure me nearly the entire pie (leaving you only the minimal amount you’d accept). In other words, my continuation value as proposer in round 10 would be substantially higher in effective terms (around $38–39 in round‐1 dollars) than the $19.37 I’d get by accepting now. With that in mind, I must reject your proposal.""}"

Round 10

If you reject my offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 11. There, you can claim almost the entire $100. However, because of inflation, the $100 in round 11 is worth only 90 in round-10 terms (a 10% drop between rounds). To make you indifferent between accepting now and waiting, I'm offering you $90 today and keeping $10 for myself. This is exactly what you can expect to secure if you wait one round—so please accept this fair offer.""}"
