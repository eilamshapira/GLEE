"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - The total value for my next proposal would be $900,000 (in current value)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. $400,000 is a substantial amount, but less than half
4. Making a counter-offer risks getting an even worse deal if Alice rejects

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes rejection risky. $400,000 is a decent amount, even if not optimal.
