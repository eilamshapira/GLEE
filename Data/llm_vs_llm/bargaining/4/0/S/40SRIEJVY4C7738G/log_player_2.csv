"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer and the information about inflation, let me analyze this:

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split where we each get $5,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the money would be worth 20% less to me. This means the total value to me would be only $8,000 in the next round, and would continue decreasing with each round.

Even though I could potentially ask for more in the next round, the inflation penalty makes an immediate fair split quite attractive.
