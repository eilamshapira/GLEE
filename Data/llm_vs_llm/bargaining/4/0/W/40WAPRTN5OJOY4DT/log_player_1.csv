"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rates while being fair enough that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since I face a higher inflation rate (10% vs Bob's 5%), I'm offering myself a slightly larger portion. This reflects the fact that waiting is more costly for me than for Bob, but I'm still keeping the division reasonably balanced to increase the chances Bob accepts rather than countering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. While it gives me less than my initial proposal, waiting another round would cost me more due to the 10% inflation I face (compared to Bob's 5%). If I reject and counter in round 3, the total value would be reduced further, and Bob might reject again, leading to even more losses from inflation. This equal split is fair given the circumstances, and accepting now maximizes my outcome."
