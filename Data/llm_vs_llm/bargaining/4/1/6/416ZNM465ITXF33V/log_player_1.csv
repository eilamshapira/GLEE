"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to start the game.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly higher amount for myself since I know I'll be affected by 5% inflation each round if we don't reach an agreement. I believe this is a reasonable split that respects both our interests."
