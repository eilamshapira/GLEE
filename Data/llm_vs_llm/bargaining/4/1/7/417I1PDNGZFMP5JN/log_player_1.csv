"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, considering the inflation:

Since the value of money for me decreases by 20% each round, and it's now round 3, the effective value of the $1,000,000 is now 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value. For Bob, the value of money decreases by 10% each round, so the effective value is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I need to ensure I get a reasonable share to make it worthwhile. I will aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering my diminishing returns.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
