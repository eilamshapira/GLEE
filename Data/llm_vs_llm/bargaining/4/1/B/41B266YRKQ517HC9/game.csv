450000.0,550000.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since there's no inflation affecting either of us in the early rounds, we have time to negotiate, but I'd like to reach a fair agreement without dragging this out too long.",Bob,2,

420000.0,580000.0,"I notice that inflation is affecting your gains but not mine. Given this dynamic, I'm proposing a 58-42 split. This actually benefits you more than it might seem, since waiting additional rounds will only reduce the real value of your share due to inflation. Let's reach an agreement soon to maximize your value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Considering the inflation, I need a more favorable split to make it worth my while. Let's negotiate a fair deal before it's too late.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider the situation objectively. Your money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1, and this will only increase with each round. For you, $400000 now is better than a larger nominal amount later due to this inflation effect. I'm proposing a 60-40 split that acknowledges this reality. We should reach an agreement now before inflation further diminishes your value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Time is running out, and inflation is eating into my share. I need a more substantial offer to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise before it's too late.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Alice, I understand you're trying to compensate for inflation by asking for more, but that strategy works against your interests. Your $380000 now is worth approximately $279338 in original value to you due to the 26.49% inflation. If we keep negotiating, your share will be worth even less due to increasing inflation. I'm offering a 62-38 split that acknowledges we're running out of time (only 4 rounds left after this). Remember, if we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing. Let's finalize this deal now to protect your remaining value.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be realistic, Bob. Inflation has significantly reduced my share's value. I'm willing to split it evenly, considering the limited time left. If we don't agree, we both risk getting nothing. It's time to find a mutually beneficial solution.",Alice,9,
