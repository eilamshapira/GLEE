"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since there's no inflation affecting either of us in the early rounds, we have time to negotiate, but I'd like to reach a fair agreement without dragging this out too long. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation that affects me, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $450,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $427,500 to me (450000 * 0.95).

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me now (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own reduced value.

The value of the money to me is now 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025, so $1,000,000 is worth $902,500 to me.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the time factor.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I notice that inflation is affecting your gains but not mine. Given this dynamic, I'm proposing a 58-42 split. This actually benefits you more than it might seem, since waiting additional rounds will only reduce the real value of your share due to inflation. Let's reach an agreement soon to maximize your value. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation that affects me, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less (1 - 0.95^3, where 3 is the number of rounds that have passed, with 5% less value each round for me, but compounded), the $420,000 offered by Bob is actually worth approximately $360,972 to me (420000 * 0.95^3).

I don't think this is a good deal for me, and Bob's offer seems to take advantage of the inflation affecting my gains. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.08% less to me now (1 - 0.95^4, where 4 is the number of rounds that have passed, with 5% less value each round for me, but compounded), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself while still being mindful of the need to reach an agreement.

The value of the money to me is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145, so $1,000,000 is worth $814,500 to me.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider the situation objectively. Your money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1, and this will only increase with each round. For you, $400000 now is better than a larger nominal amount later due to this inflation effect. I'm proposing a 60-40 split that acknowledges this reality. We should reach an agreement now before inflation further diminishes your value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation that affects me, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less (1 - 0.95^5, where 5 is the number of rounds that have passed, with 5% less value each round for me, but compounded), but Bob mentions 18.55% less in round 1 for me in his message and I think he made an error, the $400,000 offered by Bob is actually worth approximately $309,680 to me (400000 * 0.95^5, but using 0.95^6 for 6 rounds that have passed including this one for correct calculation: 400000 * 0.95^6 =  309,680  but for 5 rounds 400000 * 0.95^5 =  342,969 and then for 6 rounds  400000 * 0.95^6 =  325,736).

However I will use the correct value of $400000 * 0.95^5 =  342,969 for 5 rounds that have passed and then for 6 rounds $400000 * 0.95^6 =  325,736.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, and Bob's offer seems to take advantage of the inflation affecting my gains. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 24.71% less to me now (1 - 0.95^6, where 6 is the number of rounds that have passed, with 5% less value each round for me, but compounded), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself while still being mindful of the need to reach an agreement.

The value of the money to me is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.7473, so $1,000,000 is worth $747,300 to me.

However, considering the diminishing value, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the inflation's impact on my share. Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating into my share. I need a more substantial offer to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to compensate for inflation by asking for more, but that strategy works against your interests. Your $380000 now is worth approximately $279338 in original value to you due to the 26.49% inflation. If we keep negotiating, your share will be worth even less due to increasing inflation. I'm offering a 62-38 split that acknowledges we're running out of time (only 4 rounds left after this). Remember, if we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing. Let's finalize this deal now to protect your remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation that affects me, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 30.17% less (but Bob mentions 26.49% less in his message, I think he made an error, the $380,000 offered by Bob is actually worth approximately $264,251 to me (380000 * 0.95^8).

However I will use the correct value of $380000 * 0.95^7 =  296,527 for 7 rounds that have passed and then for 8 rounds $380000 * 0.95^8 =  281,801.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, and Bob's offer seems to take advantage of the inflation affecting my gains. However, I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both of us getting nothing.

Given the diminishing value of my potential share and the limited number of rounds left, I'll have to carefully weigh my options. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 33.57% less to me now (1 - 0.95^8, where 8 is the number of rounds that have passed, with 5% less value each round for me, but compounded), and only 3 rounds are left, I'll try to make a more realistic offer that acknowledges the significant impact of inflation on my share.

The value of the money to me is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.6634, so $1,000,000 is worth $663,400 to me.

Considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm running out of options, I'll aim for a split that is still somewhat favorable to me but also acknowledges the reality of the situation. Here's my offer for Round 9:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Bob. Inflation has significantly reduced my share's value. I'm willing to split it evenly, considering the limited time left. If we don't agree, we both risk getting nothing. It's time to find a mutually beneficial solution.""}"
