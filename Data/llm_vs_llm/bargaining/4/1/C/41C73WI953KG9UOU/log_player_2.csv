"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. Currently, $5000 is being offered.

If I reject:
- Next round value for me: $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 maximum potential value
- Even if I make a more favorable offer next round, I'll already be at a disadvantage due to inflation

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and any delay will reduce the value for me due to inflation, accepting now is the rational choice.
