"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering the risks of inflation if we delay.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 5% inflation, $50 is now worth $47.50 to me
2. My previous offer was rejected, and if I reject this one, the next round will have even more inflation
3. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and getting $47.50 in value is better than risking further depreciation
4. If I reject, I might end up with an even worse deal in the next round
