56.0,44.0,"Alice, with each round my share loses value due to inflation. To avoid further loss and reach a prompt agreement, I propose a split where I receive $44 and you get $56. I believe this is a fair compromise in our current situation. Please accept this offer.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, it seems like we both want to reach an agreement quickly.  My turn to propose - I'll take a little more to account for the decreasing value, 65/35?",Alice,3,

62.0,38.0,"Alice, every round we delay is a loss due to inflation. In round 4 my money has depreciated to about 85.7% of its original worth, and I suspect your share is also taking a hit. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $38 and you receive $62. This way, you get roughly what you might expect if you waited, and we can wrap this up quickly before the gains diminish even more. I hope you understand and accept this fair proposal.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  I know the inflation is affecting us both.  I'm willing to split 60/40 again, but I can't go any lower.",Alice,5,
