Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round my share loses value due to inflation. To avoid further loss and reach a prompt agreement, I propose a split where I receive $44 and you get $56. I believe this is a fair compromise in our current situation. Please accept this offer.

# Bob gain: 44

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay is a loss due to inflation. In round 4 my money has depreciated to about 85.7% of its original worth, and I suspect your share is also taking a hit. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $38 and you receive $62. This way, you get roughly what you might expect if you waited, and we can wrap this up quickly before the gains diminish even more. I hope you understand and accept this fair proposal. 
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to mislead me by exaggerating the inflation he's experiencing. While he claims his share has depreciated to 85.7%, implying a 14.3% decrease, in reality it seems to be losing value at about 5% per round. This suggests he's trying to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal. 

I'm willing to negotiate, but not under false pretenses.  I'll continue to propose offers that reflect a reasonable split while considering the actual inflation impact."
