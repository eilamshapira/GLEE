Round 4

In round 4 my money has depreciated to about 85.7% of its original worth, and I suspect your share is also taking a hit. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $38 and you receive $62. This way, you get roughly what you might expect if you waited, and we can wrap this up quickly before the gains diminish even more. I hope you understand and accept this fair proposal.""}"
