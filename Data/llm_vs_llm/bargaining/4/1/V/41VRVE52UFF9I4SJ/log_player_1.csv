"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Let me propose what I believe is a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the million dollars, which gives each of us $500,000. This is an equal division that respects both of our interests in maximizing our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is seeking a larger share, but his money is affected by inflation while mine isn't. Let me make a more strategic counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger portion of the money ($550,000) while I take $450,000. Since Bob faces inflation and I don't, this division acknowledges his need while still maintaining a reasonably fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob's inflation is increasing significantly (now at 27.1%), which means each round makes the money less valuable for him. Given this, I'll adjust my offer to acknowledge his increasing time pressure while still advocating for my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob $600,000 (60%) while I take $400,000 (40%). This gives Bob a substantial majority of the funds while still securing a meaningful amount for myself. Given the increasing inflation impact on Bob's share, this should be a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
