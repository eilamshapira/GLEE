"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- It's a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair
- If I reject, we move to next round where money loses 20% value
- If I reject and propose in next round, any attempt to get more than 50% might be rejected by Alice, leading to further value loss

This is a fair offer in the first round, and trying to get more would likely lead to both of us getting less due to inflation.
