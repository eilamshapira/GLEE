"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share before inflation reduces our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer now, I'll get $5000 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $4000
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but inflation will continue to erode value
3. Bob is offering a perfectly equal split, which is generally considered fair
4. The inflation is affecting me more severely than Bob (20% vs 10%)
5. Getting something now might be better than risking further value loss
