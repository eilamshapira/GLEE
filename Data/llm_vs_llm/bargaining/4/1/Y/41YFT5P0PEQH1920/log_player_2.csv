"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40%) while keeping 6000$ (60%) for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice opened with a 60-40 split in her favor, I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved slightly from her initial position (from offering me 4000$ to 4200$), which shows some willingness to negotiate, but it's still quite far from an equal split. Since we still have 9 rounds left, I think there's room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll slightly reduce my previous demand to show willingness to compromise, but still maintain a position close to an equal split.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is only making very small concessions (moving from 4200$ to 4300$). While we still have 7 rounds left, I need to consider that we might run out of rounds without reaching an agreement. However, I believe there's still room for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more significant concession to show good faith and try to move towards agreement, proposing a split that's closer to 50-50.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
