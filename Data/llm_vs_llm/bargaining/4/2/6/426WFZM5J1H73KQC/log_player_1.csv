Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's factor in the inflation. My money is worth 5% less each round, and Bob's is worth 10% less each round. So, for me, 100 dollars are now worth 95 dollars. For Bob, 100 dollars are now worth 90 dollars.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Split it 50/50. I get $5000, you get $5000. Considering the inflation, it's the fairest we can get. If you reject this, we're both losing out big time.""
