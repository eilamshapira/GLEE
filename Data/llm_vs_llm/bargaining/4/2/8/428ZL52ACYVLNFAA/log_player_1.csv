"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose taking $5,500 and giving Bob $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it. If he declines, the 5% inflation will start affecting future rounds, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, I need to consider:
- If I accept now, I get $4000 (worth 95% of original value = $3800 effective value)
- If I reject, next round my money will be worth 90% of original value, making negotiations even harder
- While Bob's money is worth less to him (80% of original), he's asking for a larger share

Even though this isn't an ideal split, the inflation pressure and the risk of further devaluation makes accepting a reasonable choice. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
