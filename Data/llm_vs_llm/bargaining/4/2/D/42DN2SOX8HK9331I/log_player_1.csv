"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I'm playing as Alice, I need to consider that Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, which gives me some leverage in negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60/40 split in our favor. This is a fair offer considering Bob's inflation penalty. If we go multiple rounds, the total value will decrease for him, so it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. Since Bob faces inflation but I don't, I can negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split than my first offer. Bob needs to consider that his inflation penalty is increasing with each round - the $450,000 I'm offering him now is worth more than what he might get in future rounds after additional inflation. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
