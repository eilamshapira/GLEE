"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after each round, I'll make a fair offer. 
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 450000, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. 
So, the actual value I'll get is 450000 * 0.81 = 364500.
I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after each round, and it's already worth 19% less after round 3, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice. 
Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get around 40-45% of the original value.
