"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the effect of inflation.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. 

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counteroffer in the next round, but due to 5% inflation, the total value to me will only be $950,000. This means even if I got the entire amount in the next round (which is unlikely), it would be worth less than the full amount now.

The $400,000 Alice is offering me now is greater than 42% of the inflation-adjusted total in the next round ($950,000 Ã— 0.42 = $399,000). Since I'm getting slightly more than this threshold, and considering the risk of further rounds reducing the value further, I should accept.
