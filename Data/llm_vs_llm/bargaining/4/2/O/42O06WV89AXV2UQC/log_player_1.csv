Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $40 is now worth $40 * 0.8 = $32.
I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less again, so it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.
I'll try to get a bit more than half, taking into account the decreased value.
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $35 is now worth $35 * (1 - 0.488) = $35 * 0.512 = $17.92.
This is a very low value, and I should consider accepting this offer to get at least some value.
