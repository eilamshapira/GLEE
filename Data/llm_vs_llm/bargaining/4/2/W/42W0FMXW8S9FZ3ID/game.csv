600000.0,400000.0,"Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a truly fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares of $500000. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'm offering a perfectly equal division that respects both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This 58-42 split is closer to 50-50 in real value for me. Let's settle before it gets worse",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I understand inflation affects you, but it doesn't affect me at all. As rounds progress, my bargaining position gets stronger. I'm offering you $450000 now, which is still substantial. If we continue to later rounds, I'll need to ask for more to account for your weakening position due to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"I understand your bargaining position, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This 56-44 split is my compromise, considering the real value I'll get. If we go further, I'll have to take a harder stance",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, the inflation effect is becoming significant for you (34.39% and growing), while having no impact on me. This fundamentally changes our bargaining positions. I'm offering you $400000, which gives you substantial value before further inflation. If we continue to later rounds, inflation will force me to request an even larger share to reflect our relative positions.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"I know inflation is hurting me, but I'm not ready to give in. This 54-46 split is my last attempt at a somewhat fair deal. If you reject, I'll have to assume you're going for maximum gain and adjust my strategy",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 46.86% for you and continuing to rise, your bargaining position is significantly weakened. This $350000 offer still gives you meaningful value before the next inflation hit. We have 4 rounds left after this - if we reach the final rounds, I'll have to ask for much more. This is a reasonable offer considering our asymmetric positions.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"I know I'm fighting an uphill battle with inflation, but I'm not giving up yet. This 52-48 split is my attempt to salvage what's left. If you reject, I'll assume you're going for a maximum win and I'll adjust my strategy for the final rounds",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, inflation has now reduced your money's value by nearly 57%. With only 2 rounds remaining after this, our negotiating positions are extremely asymmetric. This offer of $250000 to you still provides meaningful value despite inflation. If we continue to the final rounds, I'll need to ask for an even larger share as your inflation penalty approaches 70-80%. This is your best realistic option at this point.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"At this point, I'm willing to go back to a 50-50 split, despite the heavy inflation hit I've taken. This is my last attempt at a fair deal. If you reject, I'll assume you're going for a complete win and I'll make a final, desperate offer in the last round",Alice,11,
