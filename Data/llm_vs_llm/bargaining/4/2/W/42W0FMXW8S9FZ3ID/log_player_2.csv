"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I receive $400,000 (40%) while she gets $600,000 (60%). She's framing this as a ""fair"" split and suggesting we should conclude quickly to avoid inflation.

However, this isn't actually a fair split - it significantly favors Alice. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% inflation for Bob was specified), I have no urgency to accept an unfavorable division. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that's more balanced.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that's more balanced.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This 58-42 split is closer to 50-50 in real value for me. Let's settle before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $420,000 (42%) while she takes $580,000 (58%). She mentions that inflation is affecting her value (19% so far), suggesting this split is closer to fair in real terms for her.

While Alice has improved the offer slightly from the initial 40-60 split, I still don't have any inflation pressure, so I can continue negotiating for a better division. The inflation only affects Alice's position, not mine, which actually improves my bargaining position as rounds continue.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I understand inflation affects you, but it doesn't affect me at all. As rounds progress, my bargaining position gets stronger. I'm offering you $450,000 now, which is still substantial. If we continue to later rounds, I'll need to ask for more to account for your weakening position due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your bargaining position, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This 56-44 split is my compromise, considering the real value I'll get. If we go further, I'll have to take a harder stance 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $440,000 (44%) while taking $560,000 (56%). She acknowledges my stronger bargaining position but is still trying to maintain an advantage.

The inflation affecting Alice has now increased to 34.39%, which significantly weakens her position. With inflation only affecting her and not me, my bargaining power continues to increase with each round.

This offer is better than her previous ones, but given the asymmetric inflation effect, I can still negotiate for a more favorable split.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation effect is becoming significant for you (34.39% and growing), while having no impact on me. This fundamentally changes our bargaining positions. I'm offering you $400,000, which gives you substantial value before further inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting me, but I'm not ready to give in. This 54-46 split is my last attempt at a somewhat fair deal. If you reject, I'll have to assume you're going for maximum gain and adjust my strategy 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $460,000 (46%) while taking $540,000 (54%). The inflation affecting her has increased to 46.86%, meaning her $540,000 would be worth effectively much less in her real value.

She's indicating this is her ""last attempt at a somewhat fair deal"" and implying she'll shift strategy if I reject. However, the fundamental asymmetry remains - inflation affects her but not me, and we still have 5 more rounds to go.

Given the continuing inflation trend and my unchanged bargaining position, I can still push for a more favorable split.

""message"": ""Alice, with inflation now at 46.86% for you and continuing to rise, your bargaining position is significantly weakened. This $350,000 offer still gives you meaningful value before the next inflation hit. We have 4 rounds left after this - if we reach the final rounds, I'll have to ask for much more. This is a reasonable offer considering our asymmetric positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know I'm fighting an uphill battle with inflation, but I'm not giving up yet. This 52-48 split is my attempt to salvage what's left. If you reject, I'll assume you're going for a maximum win and I'll adjust my strategy for the final rounds 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $480,000 (48%) while taking $520,000 (52%). The inflation affecting her has increased to 56.95%, meaning her $520,000 would be worth effectively much less in real value to her.

She's continuing to improve her offers incrementally, but we're now entering the final rounds (only 3 more after this one). With inflation approaching 60% for Alice while I remain unaffected, my bargaining position is extremely strong.

Given that we still have several rounds remaining and Alice's position continues to weaken dramatically with each round, I should continue to negotiate for a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, 
""alice_gain"": 250000, 
""message"": ""Alice, inflation has now reduced your money's value by nearly 57%. With only 2 rounds remaining after this, our negotiating positions are extremely asymmetric. This offer of $250,000 to you still provides meaningful value despite inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: At this point, I'm willing to go back to a 50-50 split, despite the heavy inflation hit I've taken. This is my last attempt at a fair deal. If you reject, I'll assume you're going for a complete win and I'll make a final, desperate offer in the last round 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering a 50-50 split with $500,000 for each of us. However, with inflation at 65.13% for her, her $500,000 is worth significantly less in real value to her, while my $500,000 remains at full value.

We're now at the second-to-last round. If I reject, we'll have just one final round where Alice will make the last offer. In game theory terms, this is a strategic inflection point.

If I reject, there's a risk that in the final round Alice might offer me very little out of desperation, preferring that we both get nothing rather than accepting a very uneven split. However, she's explicitly indicating she'll make a ""final, desperate offer"" rather than letting us both get zero.

Given the extreme inflation affecting Alice and the near-end of negotiations, I should accept this reasonable offer.
