"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split that takes into account inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less to you each round, we should aim to reach an agreement soon. I suggest I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that if we delay, your share will be worth less to you while mine maintains its value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both deserve an equal share. While inflation affects me, we're only in round 2, so the impact is minimal so far. This even split respects both our interests, and I hope you'll agree it's fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'd like to explain my reasoning. With 5% inflation per round for you, waiting is costly for you but not for me. I've reduced my request from $55 to $53, which is more favorable to you. This split recognizes the time pressure you face due to inflation while still being close to the even split you prefer. Let's reach an agreement now rather than losing value in future rounds.""}"
