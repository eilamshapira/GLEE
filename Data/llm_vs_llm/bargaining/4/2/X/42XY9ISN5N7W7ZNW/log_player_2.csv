"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split that takes into account inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less to you each round, we should aim to reach an agreement soon. I suggest I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that if we delay, your share will be worth less to you while mine maintains its value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation penalty that affects only me.

She's offering me $45 now, while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an even split, she does have a point about the inflation - if I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 5% less.

However, I think I can make a counter-offer that could be better for me. If I reject now, I can make my own proposal in the next round, and the 5% inflation wouldn't be too significant for just one round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a more balanced split that acknowledges the inflation factor while being more equitable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both deserve an equal share. While inflation affects me, we're only in round 2, so the impact is minimal so far. This even split respects both our interests, and I hope you'll agree it's fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'd like to explain my reasoning. With 5% inflation per round for you, waiting is costly for you but not for me. I've reduced my request from $55 to $53, which is more favorable to you. This split recognizes the time pressure you face due to inflation while still being close to the even split you prefer. Let's reach an agreement now rather than losing value in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this new offer in light of the increasing inflation penalty.

Alice has reduced her request from $55 to $53, offering me $47. The inflation has already reduced the value of my money by 9.75% since round 1, and will continue to increase if we keep negotiating.

Alice makes a valid point that delays hurt me more than her due to the asymmetric inflation. If I reject again, we'll go to round 4, where my money will be worth even less.

The difference between a 50-50 split and this 47-53 split is relatively small, and considering the inflation penalty I face, accepting now is likely better than continuing to negotiate while my purchasing power decreases.
