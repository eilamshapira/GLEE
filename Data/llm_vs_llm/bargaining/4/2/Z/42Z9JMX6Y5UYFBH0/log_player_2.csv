"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is proposing a split where she gets $60 and I get $40. With inflation affecting me at 10% per round and Alice at 5% per round, delaying would reduce the value of my potential share faster than hers.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, the total value would already be worth less to me. While I could propose a more favorable split for myself, there's no guarantee Alice would accept, and we'd lose more value with each round.

Given the inflation asymmetry and the fact that $40 now is better than potentially nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'll accept this offer.
