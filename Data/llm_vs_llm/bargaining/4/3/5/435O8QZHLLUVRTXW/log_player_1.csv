"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more to account for potential inflation risks. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, Alice. How about we turn the tables?  This offer protects me a bit more, and we can settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000 with 5% inflation, so effectively $427,500
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
* Even if I managed to get $550,000 in the next round, it would be worth $495,000 due to 10% inflation
* Better to accept a smaller amount now than risk further devaluation
