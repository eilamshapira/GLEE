"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more to account for potential inflation risks. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's explanation sounds reasonable, it's the first round. I'm willing to gamble that she's more concerned about inflation than she's letting on.  I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round."
