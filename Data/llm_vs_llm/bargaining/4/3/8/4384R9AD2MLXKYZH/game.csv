5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 20% inflation each round while you don't. This is actually quite fair - if we go to round 2, my $5500 would only be worth $4400 to me. Let's settle this now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's split this fairly at 50/50. This gives you $5000 now, which is better than getting $5500 next round when it would only be worth $4400 to you due to your 20% inflation. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",Bob,2,
