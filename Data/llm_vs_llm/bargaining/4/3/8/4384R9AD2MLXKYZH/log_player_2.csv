"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 20% inflation each round while you don't. This is actually quite fair - if we go to round 2, my $5500 would only be worth $4400 to me. Let's settle this now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is correct that she faces 20% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation. If we go to round 2, her money would be worth 20% less to her.

However, this also means I have a strategic advantage. If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would likely accept a less favorable split (from her perspective) because of the inflation effect.

While $4500 is a substantial amount, I believe I can propose a more favorable division in the next round given our different inflation rates.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's split this fairly at 50/50. This gives you $5000 now, which is better than getting $5500 next round when it would only be worth $4400 to you due to your 20% inflation. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.""}"
