Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We're both equally entitled to the money, and this split maximizes our collective benefit. With this equal division, we can both walk away satisfied and avoid further devaluation of the total amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
