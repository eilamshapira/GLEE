"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep things fair and move on to enjoy our shares quickly. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:
- Alice offers me $4500 out of $10,000 (45%)
- She would get $5500 (55%)
- If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
- But the total amount decreases by 5% to $9,500
- I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer, but we also risk losing value through multiple rounds

While I could counter-offer, Alice's initial proposal isn't extremely lopsided, and preserving most of the value is important.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that acknowledges the time value of money and the need for cooperation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We're both equally entitled to the money, and this split maximizes our collective benefit. With this equal division, we can both walk away satisfied and avoid further devaluation of the total amount.""}"
