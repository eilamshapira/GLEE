"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you a substantial 45% share, considering we both want to avoid the inflation penalty by resolving this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be fair, but I believe a 47.5% to 52.5% split is more reasonable, considering the potential losses from inflation if we prolong this. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's still a favorable split (52.5% for me)
2. Due to 5% inflation, if I reject and try to get a better deal next round, my share would be worth less
3. Bob's offer is reasonable and shows willingness to compromise
4. Prolonging the negotiation is risky due to the inflation penalty
5. Early agreement helps avoid the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement"
