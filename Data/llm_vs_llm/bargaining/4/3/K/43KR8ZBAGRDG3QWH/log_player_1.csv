"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000.

Since there's 10% inflation for me in each round, I should consider this when making my initial proposal. I want to be fair but also account for the disadvantage I face from inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
 ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This is slightly in my favor, but accounts for the fact that if we go to another round, the value of the money will decrease for me but not for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob made a very aggressive offer in round 2. Let me make a more reasonable counter-offer, while keeping in mind that with each round, my position weakens due to the 10% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
 ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair and reasonable, especially considering that I've already lost value from the inflation in previous rounds. A 50-50 split is the standard fair division, and I hope Bob recognizes this as a balanced proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob continues to make extremely aggressive offers that are clearly unfair. I'll try one more reasonable approach, though I have to consider that with each round, I'm losing more value due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
 ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is somewhat in my favor to compensate for the inflation losses I've already incurred through previous rounds. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion, and I hope we can reach an agreement to avoid further rounds of inflation that decrease the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is consistently offering me only $1, which is essentially nothing. It's clear that Bob is trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to force me to eventually accept an unfair offer. I need to consider my strategy carefully.

Given the inflation rate, by round 7, the money I receive is worth about 50% less than in round 1. If this continues for many more rounds, Bob might eventually gain an advantage by waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
 ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm proposing that I receive $7,500 and Bob receives $2,500. This compensates me for the significant inflation losses I've already incurred while still giving Bob a meaningful portion. If Bob is rational and understands the game theory here, they should recognize that we both benefit from reaching an agreement rather than continuing this pattern of rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
