"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice suggests a 40/60 split in her favor
2. While it's not a 50/50 split, it's a reasonable first offer
3. If I reject, I could counter with a better offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice would accept
   - The money's value remains the same for me, but I don't know about Alice
   - We have limited rounds and risk getting nothing

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split that benefits us both equally. This is the most equitable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has moved from 40/60 to 43/57, showing willingness to negotiate
2. Important new information: Alice's gains are worth 19% less now
3. 57 for Alice is actually worth about 46.17 in round 1 value for her
4. My 43 is still worth 43 as I'm not affected by inflation
5. Given the inflation effect on Alice, this offer is closer to a fair split in real value
6. Rejecting might lead to further rounds where Alice's inflation gets worse

Given these factors, especially the inflation effect on Alice's side, this is actually a reasonably fair offer in real terms. I'll accept.
