"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice is offering me $30, while taking $70 for herself. Rather uneven split.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, so $100 becomes effectively $90 for me.

However, I can likely propose a more equitable split next round and since Alice doesn't face inflation pressure, she might be more willing to accept a fair offer rather than drag this out.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I face inflation pressure but Alice doesn't, I'll propose a relatively fair split but slightly in my favor to account for the fact that I've already lost 10% of value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is much more equitable than Alice's initial offer while still giving me a slight advantage. This should be reasonable enough for Alice to accept, avoiding further rounds where I'd lose more value to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has increased her offer from $30 to $35
2. Due to 19% inflation for me, $35 is actually worth about $28.35 to me now
3. If I reject and we continue to next round, I'll face 28% inflation
4. Alice seems to be making small concessions but maintaining a significantly advantageous position
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but every round makes my position weaker due to inflation

While I'm not happy with this split, the inflation is really hurting my negotiating position. If we continue much longer, even a fair split would be worth much less to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject one more time and try to negotiate a better deal, but I'll need to be careful about letting this go on too long."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm now facing 28% inflation on my next gain and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but not make major concessions, I need to make a strategic offer that's more likely to be accepted while still being better than her last offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is a fair and principled offer that's hard to argue against. While I'd prefer more, the mounting inflation pressure means I need to make an offer that Alice is likely to accept. A 50-50 split is still significantly better for me than Alice's last offer of 35-65, even accounting for inflation."
