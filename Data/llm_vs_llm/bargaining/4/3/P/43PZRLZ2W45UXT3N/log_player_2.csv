I'd like to propose a more balanced split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs your 10%), I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives us both a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that waiting is more costly for me than for you."
