"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the risk of losing everything after 12 rounds and the uncertainty of inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

*   **I'm asking for 60%**: This gives me a slightly larger share, which I feel is reasonable as the proposer. However, it's not so greedy that Bob will immediately reject it.
*   **Bob gets 40%**: This is a substantial amount that Bob might find acceptable, especially given the risk of the game ending with nothing.
*   **Early offer**: Making this offer early leverages the fact that there is still a long way to go and Bob would risk more money if the game would end after round 12."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob rejected my initial offer and now it's his turn to propose. He's offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for himself. Crucially, the money he gains is worth 20% less to him than in the first round, while the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round.

Here's my thought process:

*   **My potential gain:** $400,000 is a decent amount.
*   **Bob's potential gain:** $600,000, but with 20% less value. So it's worth $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000 in round 1 terms for him.
*   **Risk of further rounds:** If I reject, we risk more inflation and potentially not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds.
*   **Fairness:** I think that he has the advantage of knowing the money I gain is worth the same amount of money as in round 1. This is something I did not know when making my decision in round 1, and therefore he should be more willing to share more than I was in round 1.

Given all of this, $400,000 is a good deal for me.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
