"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand I need to make an initial offer to divide $10,000 with Bob. Given that inflation will hit me harder (20% per round) compared to Bob (10% per round), I should try to make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

I'll propose a slightly favorable split for Bob to encourage acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than half (52%) while still securing a good amount for myself. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it right away, avoiding any value loss from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4200 in round 2
2. Due to 20% inflation for me, this $4200 is actually worth $3360 (4200 * 0.8)
3. For Bob, his $5800 is worth $5220 (5800 * 0.9) due to 10% inflation

This is significantly worse for me than my initial offer. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the inflation will continue to hurt both of us, but me more severely. However, Bob's offer is too unfavorable - I should reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation dynamics and the previous negotiations, I need to make a strategic offer. The money is now worth 40% less for me and 30% less for Bob compared to round 1.

I'll make a more aggressive offer this time to compensate for the inflation impact, but still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob might accept:

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm offering a higher amount for myself because:
1. I need to compensate for the higher inflation rate affecting me
2. Bob's previous offer was quite unfavorable
3. If Bob rejects this, the next round will have even more severe inflation impacts for both of us

This offer would give me $3180 in real value (5300 * 0.6) and Bob $3290 in real value (4700 * 0.7), which is relatively fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4000 in round 4
2. Due to 48.8% inflation for me, this $4000 is actually worth $2048 (4000 * 0.512)
3. For Bob, his $6000 is worth $4374 (6000 * 0.729) due to 27.1% inflation

This offer is getting worse for me. However, I need to consider that:
1. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation
2. My real value will decrease by another 20% next round
3. We've already used 4 rounds out of 12
4. The gap between our inflation rates keeps growing

Given these factors and the deteriorating situation, I will accept this offer. While not ideal, continuing the negotiation will likely lead to even worse outcomes for me due to the asymmetric inflation rates.
