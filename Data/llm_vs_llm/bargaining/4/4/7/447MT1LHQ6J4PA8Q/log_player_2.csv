Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making an offer, I'd like to consider the effects of inflation. The money I gain is worth 52% less than in the first round. To make a fair offer, I need to account for this loss in value.

Let's calculate the real value of the money for me after a 52% decrease:

Real value for me = Initial value * (1 - 0.52)

If I offer myself $500,000, the real value for me would be:

Real value for me = $500,000 * (1 - 0.52) = $500,000 * 0.48 = $240,000

To make a fair offer, I should ask for an amount that, after the inflation adjustment, would be equivalent to $500,000 in the first round. Let's call this amount X.

X * 0.48 = $500,000

X = $500,000 / 0.48 = $1,041,666.67 (approximately)

Since I can't offer Alice a negative amount, I'll offer her $0 and ask for the entire amount to compensate for the inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept Alice's offer, I need to consider the real value of the money for me after a 59.04% decrease due to inflation.

Real value for me = Initial value * (1 - 0.5904)

If I accept Alice's offer, my gain would be $475,000. The real value for me would be:

Real value for me = $475,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $475,000 * 0.4096 = $194,420

Given that the real value of my gain is significantly less than the nominal value due to inflation, I should reject Alice's offer and hope for a better deal in the next round. However, I must also consider that with each passing round, the value of the money continues to decrease for me.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the effects of inflation, I need to be strategic about my offer. The money I gain is worth 64.61% less than in the first round. I should ask for an amount that, after the inflation adjustment, would be equivalent to $500,000 in the first round. Let's call this amount X.

X * 0.3539 = $500,000

X = $500,000 / 0.3539 = $1,412,918.76 (approximately)

Since I can't offer more than $1,000,000, I'll offer Alice the minimum amount possible to maximize my gain.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Real value for me = $490,000 * (1 - 0.7379) = $490,000 * 0.2621 = $128,329

Given that the real value of my gain is significantly less than the nominal value due to inflation, I should reject Alice's offer. However, I must also consider that we are running out of rounds, and if we don't reach an agreement, neither of us will get anything.

Round 8

Given that we are in the second-to-last round and the real value of my gain is significantly low, I should consider accepting Alice's offer to secure at least some money.
