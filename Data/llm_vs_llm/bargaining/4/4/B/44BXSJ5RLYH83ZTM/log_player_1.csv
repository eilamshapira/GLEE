"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's important to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob's extremely one-sided offer in Round 2 suggests he may be aiming for a highly favorable outcome.  By slightly lowering my demand, I signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better split than Bob offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me, accepting $0 is worse than any potential future outcome. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor, but I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable as we approach the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"":  50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** The inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and fair proposal. It signals that I'm willing to compromise and prioritize a swift resolution. 

I believe this offer has the best chance of being accepted given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly entrenched in trying to get the full amount. However, even with the significant inflation, accepting $0 is not a rational choice. There is a slim chance he might offer something in the next round to avoid both of us getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough situation as the value for me is rapidly decreasing.  My goals are:

* **Avoid $0:**  Bob has consistently offered nothing, so I need to incentivize him to compromise.
* **Salvage Value:**  While 40 is much lower than my initial goals, getting something is significantly better than nothing at this point with inflation. 

This offer is a significant concession, but hopefully enough to encourage Bob to accept before we both lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Sadly, the game has reached a point where the impact of inflation is too great. While $1 is a paltry sum compared to my earlier goals, it's still more beneficial than continuing to play and risking getting $0 in the final round. Bob seems determined to offer me nothing, so this is the best (and only) realistic option I have left."
