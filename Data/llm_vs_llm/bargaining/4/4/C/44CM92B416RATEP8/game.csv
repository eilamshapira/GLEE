40.0,60.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%) in each round. This is a fair deal for both of us.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Alright Bob, let's try this again. Considering the time wasted and further inflation, I believe this split is reasonable. Take it or leave it.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I've reduced my request from the previous 60-40 split to show good faith. This 55-45 split is very fair considering my higher inflation rate. Let's not waste more rounds - we're both losing value with each rejection.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Okay Bob, let's find some middle ground. With the value of our money dwindling, I'm offering an even 55-45 split. This is the best I can do. Accept this offer or you'll regret it.",Alice,5,
