"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and easy, Bob. I'm offering you a good chunk, let's not waste time! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $10 for me and $90 for Alice is far too uneven. Given that we both need to agree on the split, and considering the different inflation rates affecting us, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%) in each round. This is a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's try this again. Considering the time wasted and further inflation, I believe this split is reasonable. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 35-65 split is still not fair enough, especially considering I face higher inflation rates (10% per round vs Alice's 5%). Even with the current inflation impact, I'd be better off making a counter-proposal in the next round. While Alice has improved the offer from the initial 10-90 split, there's still room for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I've reduced my request from the previous 60-40 split to show good faith. This 55-45 split is very fair considering my higher inflation rate. Let's not waste more rounds - we're both losing value with each rejection.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's find some middle ground. With the value of our money dwindling, I'm offering an even 55-45 split. This is the best I can do. Accept this offer or you'll regret it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the 45-55 split is reasonably fair, and with the significant inflation impact already (I've lost 34.39% of value), continuing to negotiate would likely lead to worse outcomes for both of us. The difference between our positions has narrowed significantly, and this is a workable compromise."
