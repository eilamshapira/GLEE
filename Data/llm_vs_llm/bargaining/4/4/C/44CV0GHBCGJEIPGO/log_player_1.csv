Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the devaluation rates affecting us both, this is a fair split that gives us both substantial value. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round due to 10% inflation on your side. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
