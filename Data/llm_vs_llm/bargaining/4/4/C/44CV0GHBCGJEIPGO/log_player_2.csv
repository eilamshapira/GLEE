"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a simple split: 80/20. Take it or leave it, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 2000$ out of 10,000$ (20%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   - I get to make the next proposal

Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), and this first offer is quite unfavorable to me, I can probably get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that Alice's money devalues faster (10% vs 5%), and we're in round 2:
- For Alice, money is worth 90% of original value
- For me, money is worth 95% of original value

I should propose a more balanced split, but one that considers our different devaluation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given the devaluation rates affecting us both, this is a fair split that gives us both substantial value. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round due to 10% inflation on your side.""}"
