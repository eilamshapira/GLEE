"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my gain, keeping inflation in mind.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a significant portion (40%), hoping he'll accept it readily. This gives me a good starting point before inflation takes a serious toll. I'm aiming for a balance between a favorable outcome for me and an offer Bob is likely to accept in the first round."
