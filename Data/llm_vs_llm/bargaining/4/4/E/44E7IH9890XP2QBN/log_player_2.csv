"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
* If I reject and move to next round:
  * Money will be worth 20% less for me ($8,000 effective total)
  * I could make a counter-offer, but Alice's money only devalues 5%
  * Even with a better split next round, I may end up with less in real value

Given these considerations, while 40% isn't ideal, accepting now gives me $4,000 which is better than risking a 20% devaluation to potentially get a bit more.
