"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me only $1,000 out of $10,000, which is a very small portion (10%). Considering that in the next round I would be able to make my own proposal, and even with 20% inflation I could propose a much better deal for myself, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation effect. Since we're now in round 2, the money is worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 is effectively worth $8,000 from my perspective. I should propose a fair split that accounts for this while being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500, which is 45% of the total amount. This is much more generous than what she offered me, and it should seem reasonable enough for her to accept rather than moving to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully:

In round 3, due to inflation:
- My $4,000 would be worth 36% less than in round 1, so effectively worth $2,560 to me
- Alice's $6,000 would be worth 19% less than in round 1, so effectively worth $4,860 to her

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- The inflation would increase further for both of us
- I'd be able to make another offer, but Alice might reject again

Alice has significantly improved her offer from round 1 ($1,000 to me) to now offering me $4,000. This is a substantial improvement and shows she's willing to negotiate. Given the increasing inflation penalties and the reasonable offer, I should accept.
