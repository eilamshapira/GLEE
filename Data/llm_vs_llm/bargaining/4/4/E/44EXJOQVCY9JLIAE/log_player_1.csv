"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. I take $900,000, you take $100,000.  It's important to settle this quickly as the value decreases over time, and you're losing more than I am.""
}
``` 

This offer is designed to be heavily in my (Alice's) favor but still tempting enough for Bob to consider accepting in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we can find a more balanced deal, but time is of the essence. 
# Alice gain: 905000 
# Bob gain: 95000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is a slight improvement, but it's not enough to sway me. He's feeling the pressure of inflation, so I'll hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 875000,
""bob_gain"": 125000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. The longer we wait, the less your share is worth. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
```

This offer is strategically designed:

* **Compromise:** It shows I'm willing to come down from my initial demand, but not drastically. 
* **Time Pressure:** It emphasizes the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings, urging him to act quickly.
* **Appearance of Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair offer"" and appealing to reason, I aim to increase the chance of Bob accepting.

This approach maintains pressure on Bob while still aiming for a favorable resolution for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle on this division. I understand time is of concern, but I need to ensure I get something fair. 
# Alice gain: 910000 
# Bob gain: 90000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tricky one. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure, but his offer is only a marginal improvement over his previous one.  While the difference to me is relatively small at this point, I believe holding out for one more round is worth the risk.  The inflation is cutting into his share significantly, making him more likely to make a substantial jump in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm taking a significant cut to end this now.  You're getting $150,000 which is far more valuable now than it will be if we drag this on.""
}
```

This is a calculated risk.  

* **Strategic Retreat:** I'm appearing to make a big concession, going lower than any previous offer.  This might make Bob feel like he's finally getting the upper hand and push him to accept.
* **Finality:** By declaring it my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision now.
* **Highlighting Loss:** Emphasizing the diminishing value of his potential winnings due to inflation reinforces the need to settle quickly. 

This approach aims to exploit the psychology of the negotiation and secure a reasonable deal for Alice before inflation further erodes the value."
