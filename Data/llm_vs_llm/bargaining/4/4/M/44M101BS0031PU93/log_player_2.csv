Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer considering the inflation for Bob:

* Real value of Bob's gain: 48 * (1 - 0.512) = 48 * 0.488 = 23.424
* Real value of Alice's gain: 52 * (1 - 0.3439) = 52 * 0.6561 = 34.1172

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","* Real value of Bob's gain: 50 * (1 - 0.8322) = 50 * 0.1678 = 8.39
* Real value of Alice's gain: 50 * (1 - 0.5695) = 50 * 0.4305 = 21.525

Given the high inflation rate for Bob, it might be reasonable to accept this offer to secure some value before it diminishes further.
