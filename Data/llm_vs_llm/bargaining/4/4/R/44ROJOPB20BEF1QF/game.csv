7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering you $3000 and I'll take $7000. Consider that with each round, your money loses 20% of its value due to inflation, so $3000 now is better than potentially more in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with something substantial!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This way we both get an equal amount of $5000. Even with the inflation effect, this is still better for me than your initial offer, and it's also fair for you. Let's agree on this equal division and conclude the deal now.",Bob,2,
