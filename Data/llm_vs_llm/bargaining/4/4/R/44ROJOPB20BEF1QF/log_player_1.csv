"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you $3,000 and I'll take $7,000. Consider that with each round, your money loses 20% of its value due to inflation, so $3,000 now is better than potentially more in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with something substantial!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This way we both get an equal amount of $5000. Even with the inflation effect, this is still better for me than your initial offer, and it's also fair for you. Let's agree on this equal division and conclude the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
