"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you $3000 and I'll take $7000. Consider that with each round, your money loses 20% of its value due to inflation, so $3000 now is better than potentially more in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with something substantial! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $3000 out of $10,000, keeping $7000 for herself. While she's right that inflation will reduce the value of my money in future rounds, this first offer gives me only 30% of the total amount.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 20% less (so effectively $8,000 total value). But I could propose a more equitable split.

Given that we're just starting negotiations and I have the opportunity to make a more favorable counter-offer, I'll reject this initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This way we both get an equal amount of $5000. Even with the inflation effect, this is still better for me than your initial offer, and it's also fair for you. Let's agree on this equal division and conclude the deal now.""}"
