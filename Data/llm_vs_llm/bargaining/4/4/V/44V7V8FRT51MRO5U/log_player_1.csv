Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since we both face 10% inflation per round, it's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than delaying. This offer gives us both a substantial amount right away without risking depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. To ensure fairness and considering the inflation impact, I propose an even split of $500000 each. This way, we both lose equally if the game continues. Letâ€™s agree now and take an equal share to avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
