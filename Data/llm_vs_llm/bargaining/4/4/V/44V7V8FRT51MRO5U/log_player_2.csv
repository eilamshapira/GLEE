"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since we both face 10% inflation per round, it's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than delaying. This offer gives us both a substantial amount right away without risking depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
