"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since inflation means your money is worth less each round, let's avoid prolonging the game. I'm offering you $40, which is a fair split considering the inflation factor. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for you, so this is actually a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
