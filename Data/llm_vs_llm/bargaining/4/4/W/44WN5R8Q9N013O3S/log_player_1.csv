"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I (Alice) get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair division that gives both of us a significant portion of the money. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% per round compared to my 5%), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable first-round offer rather than waiting for the next round when the total value will decrease for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the changing value due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose that I (Alice) get $52 and Bob gets $48. This is a more balanced offer than my previous one. Since we're now in round 3, Bob is facing a significant inflation penalty of 20% per round, meaning his money is worth substantially less than in round 1. For me, the inflation is only 5% per round. This offer gives Bob a larger share than my previous offer while still recognizing the asymmetric inflation rates we face."
