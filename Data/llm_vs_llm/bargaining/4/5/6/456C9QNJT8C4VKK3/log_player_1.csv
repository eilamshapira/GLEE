"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation rates. This way we both get a good portion without risking value loss in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the higher inflation rate for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we can end the game sooner and minimize the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll reject because with the current inflation rates, waiting one more round isn't too costly for me (5%), while it's more costly for Bob (10%). I can make a better offer in the next round that Bob might be more likely to accept given his higher inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With your 10% inflation rate, waiting another round will cost you significantly. This 58-42 split is fair given our different inflation rates, and it's better for you to accept now than risk further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid devaluation of my share, I'm proposing a 58-42 split in my favor this round. This is a fair adjustment considering my higher inflation rate, and it's crucial we end the game soon to preserve the value of our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept because:
1. The inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us
2. If I reject, my next offer would need to be very attractive to Bob due to his high inflation rate, which would likely mean I'd need to offer less than 4200 to myself
3. Getting 4200 now is better than risking further rounds where both our shares continue to devalue
4. The difference between this offer and my last offer has narrowed enough to make accepting reasonable"
