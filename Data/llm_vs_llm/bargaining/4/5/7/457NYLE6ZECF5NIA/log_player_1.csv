Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses value each round, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually better for you now than waiting for later rounds when your share would be worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
