"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine stays the same, I have an advantage by waiting. If I reject now, in the next round:
- I can propose a split
- Her portion will be worth 5% less to her
- My portion maintains full value

This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself by rejecting this even split. However, I need to be careful not to push too far and end up with nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, I can justify asking for a bit more than 50-50. I'll propose a 60-40 split, which is reasonable given the time pressure and value decay for her.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since your money loses value each round, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually better for you now than waiting for later rounds when your share would be worth even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob.  However, 60-40 is still too much in your favor.  I'm willing to compromise, let's try 45-55.  This way, we both get a decent share, and I don't lose out too much from the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 55%, which is better than her initial 50-50 split
2. The inflation factor is becoming significant (9.75% now)
3. While I could potentially get more by waiting, there's a risk of:
   - Running out of rounds
   - Alice becoming more resistant to larger splits
4. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both the inflation factor and the need for fairness

Given these factors, this seems like a good deal. If I reject, her money will continue to lose value, but we might waste too much time negotiating and risk getting nothing.
