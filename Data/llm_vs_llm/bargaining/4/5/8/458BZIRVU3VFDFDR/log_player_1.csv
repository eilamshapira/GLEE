"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, I'm Alice and I need to make a fair offer to divide $100 with Bob, considering the inflation penalties.

I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob faces steeper inflation (10% per round) compared to my 5% per round. This means Bob has more incentive to accept earlier rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob. This is a fair split considering that if we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more quickly than I do because of the different inflation rates."
