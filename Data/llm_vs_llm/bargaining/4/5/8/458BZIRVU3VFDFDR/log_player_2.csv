"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. This is slightly in her favor. However, I need to consider the inflation rates:
- My inflation: 10% per round
- Alice's inflation: 5% per round

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, but the total value will decrease more for me than for Alice. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value, with me losing more quickly.

$45 now is better than potentially getting less later due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me.
