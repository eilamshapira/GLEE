"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even split: $50 each. Let's agree now and avoid prolonging the game - it's a fair and simple solution! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is proposing a perfectly equal split of $50 each, which is objectively fair. While I could try to negotiate for more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's a risk in prolonging the game. The 50-50 split is a common and reasonable solution that avoids the risk of both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds.
