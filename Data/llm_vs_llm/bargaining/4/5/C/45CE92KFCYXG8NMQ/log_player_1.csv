"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly favorable split to me, but hoping it's close enough that Bob will accept and we can avoid further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
