"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation rates for both of us.

This is a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000. However, if I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation while Alice faces 20% inflation. This gives me an advantage in future rounds since the money devalues faster for Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I could potentially get a larger share. Given the significant inflation difference (my 5% vs Alice's 20%), I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because it reflects the reality that the money devalues much faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). If we drag this negotiation out longer, it hurts Alice significantly more than it hurts me. This 60-40 split is fair given our different time preferences, and accepting now is better for both of us than continuing to future rounds with compounding inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer considering our current inflation rates.

After round 3, I'm facing 9.75% inflation, while Alice is facing 36% inflation. This means delays hurt Alice significantly more than they hurt me. Her offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for herself is actually worse than her initial 50-50 split, which doesn't make sense given her worse inflation position.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where I can make a counter-offer. With each round, Alice's position weakens more rapidly than mine due to the higher inflation rate she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that better reflects our differential inflation rates while being more compelling for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I propose this division because the longer we go in this negotiation, the worse it gets for Alice due to her much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 5%). By round 4, her money has already lost 36% of its value while mine has only lost 9.75%. 

If she rejects this offer, we'll go to round 5, where her share would be worth even less. This offer gives her $3500 now, which is worth more than what she might get after further rounds of high inflation. It's in both our interests to conclude this negotiation soon, and this split acknowledges our different time pressures."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer at this point in the game.

Current inflation impact:
- My money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 59.04% less than round 1

Alice is now offering me $5800 and taking $4200 for herself. This is a significant improvement from her previous offers and reflects the reality that she's facing much steeper inflation than I am. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for Alice, which explains why she's now offering me the larger share.

Given that:
1. I'm now being offered 58% of the total
2. Alice's inflation is much higher than mine
3. We're already in round 5 with only 7 rounds left
4. This is better than my last proposal
