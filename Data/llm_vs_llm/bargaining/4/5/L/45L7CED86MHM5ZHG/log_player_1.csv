"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to keep almost all the money and give Bob just $1.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'll take a greedy approach.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting significantly less than I initially proposed, it's still a substantial amount of money.  It's not worth risking that Bob might offer me even less in the next round, especially with inflation impacting his gains."
