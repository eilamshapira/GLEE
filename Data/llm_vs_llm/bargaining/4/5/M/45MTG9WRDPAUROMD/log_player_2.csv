"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. It's a fair offer considering I'm making the proposal first. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing a 60/40 split, where I (Bob) would receive $40 and she would receive $60.

While it's not an equal split, I need to weigh my options. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept. Also, the instructions mention inflation, though it's 0% for me, meaning the money's value won't decrease for me in future rounds.

Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and a $40 gain is still substantial, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice's position.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we can both walk away satisfied with the outcome.""}"
