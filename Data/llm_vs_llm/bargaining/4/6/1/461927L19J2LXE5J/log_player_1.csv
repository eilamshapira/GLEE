"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of the money as the rounds progress. To start, I'll make a relatively generous offer to encourage Bob to accept it quickly.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think this through. Accepting 45 now means I get 45 * 0.8 = 36 ""real"" dollars (in round 1 money). If I reject, I have to make an offer in round 3 where the money will be worth even less to me.

Let's see what happens if I reject and aim for a better offer in round 3. Let's assume I think I can get 55 in round 3 and Bob accepts. That would be 55 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 35.2 real dollars. That's less than accepting 45 now (36).

Therefore, I should accept this offer to secure at least 36 real dollars.
