"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our interests, but also accounts for the fact that inflation will affect me if we delay.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer where I get a slightly larger share to account for my inflation risk, but Bob still gets a substantial portion. I propose this split to encourage quick agreement and avoid the impact of inflation on future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $4500 to me now
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth even less (90% of face value)
4. A fair equal split shows Bob is being reasonable
5. Prolonging negotiations will only decrease the value further for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer and accepting now is better than risking further value loss from inflation."
