4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since we both face inflation penalties (yours is higher at 20% versus my 10%), it makes sense to reach a fair agreement now. I'm proposing a more equitable split that gives you 4500 and me 5500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation differences, and we both benefit by concluding the negotiation now rather than continuing to lose value.",Bob,2,
