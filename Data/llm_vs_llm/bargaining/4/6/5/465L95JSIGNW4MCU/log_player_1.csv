"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since we both face inflation penalties (yours is higher at 20% versus my 10%), it makes sense to reach a fair agreement now. I'm proposing a more equitable split that gives you 4500 and me 5500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation differences, and we both benefit by concluding the negotiation now rather than continuing to lose value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
