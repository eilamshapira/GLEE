"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob. I think this is a great start for us both. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me only $2,000 while she keeps $8,000, which is a very uneven split. Given that we both face inflation penalties but mine is less severe (10% vs her 20%), it's in my interest to make a counter-offer in the next round rather than accept this unbalanced proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since we both face inflation penalties (yours is higher at 20% versus my 10%), it makes sense to reach a fair agreement now. I'm proposing a more equitable split that gives you 4,500 and me 5,500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation differences, and we both benefit by concluding the negotiation now rather than continuing to lose value.""}"
