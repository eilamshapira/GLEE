500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, waiting would reduce the value for me significantly. This even split is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial value right now.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, considering the 20% inflation you face, this offer gives you $400000 now which is better than $500000 next round (which would be worth only $400000 to you due to inflation). This is a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with significant value.",Bob,2,
