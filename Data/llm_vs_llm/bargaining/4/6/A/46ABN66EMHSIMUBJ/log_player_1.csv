"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, waiting would reduce the value for me significantly. This even split is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial value right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 20% inflation you face, this offer gives you $400000 now which is better than $500000 next round (which would be worth only $400000 to you due to inflation). This is a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with significant value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
