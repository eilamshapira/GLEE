"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, waiting would reduce the value for me significantly. This even split is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial value right now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice revealed she faces 20% inflation per round, while I face 0% inflation
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - I can make an offer
   - Alice's value will be reduced by 20%
   - My value stays the same
3. This means in round 2, I could offer Alice less and she might accept since her purchasing power is decreasing
4. The current offer gives me $500,000, but I could potentially get more by rejecting

Given this analysis, it makes strategic sense to reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split next round when Alice's position is weaker due to inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round and has revealed this information, I'll propose a split that reflects this reduced bargaining power while still being attractive enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the 20% inflation you face, this offer gives you $400,000 now which is better than $500,000 next round (which would be worth only $400,000 to you due to inflation). This is a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with significant value.""}"
