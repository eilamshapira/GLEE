4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, since the money is worth 10% less to you this round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split. This $4000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting another round where your money would lose more value. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation factor.",Bob,2,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 27% for you, each round is significantly reducing the value of your potential gain. This offer of $3500 now is actually worth more to you than what you'd get after another round of inflation. If we continue, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increased delay. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Bob,4,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, inflation has now reduced the value of any money you receive by over 40%. Your last offer of $5800 would only be worth about $3400 in round 1 value to you. I'm offering you $3000 now, which is still substantial given the circumstances. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, and I'll need to ask for an even larger share to compensate for the extended negotiation. This offer represents a fair resolution considering the inflation effect.",Bob,6,
