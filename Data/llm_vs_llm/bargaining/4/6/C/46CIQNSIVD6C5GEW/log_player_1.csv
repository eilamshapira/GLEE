"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the money is worth 10% less to you this round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split. This $4000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting another round where your money would lose more value. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me now (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a better deal to make up for the loss in value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation now at 27% for you, each round is significantly reducing the value of your potential gain. This offer of $3500 now is actually worth more to you than what you'd get after another round of inflation. If we continue, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increased delay. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and the inflation is indeed reducing the value of my potential gain. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 30.79% less to me now (10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, and 10% less in Round 4, with compounding), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk with each round, so I need a better split to compensate for the loss in value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation has now reduced the value of any money you receive by over 40%. Your last offer of $5800 would only be worth about $3400 in round 1 value to you. I'm offering you $3000 now, which is still substantial given the circumstances. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, and I'll need to ask for an even larger share to compensate for the extended negotiation. This offer represents a fair resolution considering the inflation effect. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation reducing the value of my potential gain by over 40%, I'm starting to feel the pressure. Bob's offer of $3000 is not ideal, but considering the circumstances, it might be the best I can get at this point.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
