"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 each. While this might seem fair at first glance, I should consider the incentives in this game.

With each round, the money is worth 10% less to Alice, but its value doesn't decrease for me. This gives me some negotiation leverage. If we go to another round, I could potentially get more than $5,000.

Given this dynamic, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in this round, I can propose a division that still gives her significant value while being more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, since the money is worth 10% less to you this round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split. This $4,000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting another round where your money would lose more value. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I need a better deal to make up for the loss in value 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. This is actually worse for me than her initial offer of $5,000 each.

I should also consider that:
1. The money's value doesn't decrease for me across rounds
2. Alice is experiencing 10% inflation per round (now at 19% total)
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where Alice's money will be worth even less (about 27% less than round 1)

Given that Alice is trying to get more money despite already being at a disadvantage due to inflation, and offering me less than her initial offer, I don't think this is reasonable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the increasing inflation pressure on Alice while securing a better position for myself. Since inflation has compounded for Alice over several rounds, I'll create an offer that should be more compelling for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, with inflation now at 27% for you, each round is significantly reducing the value of your potential gain. This offer of $3,500 now is actually worth more to you than what you'd get after another round of inflation. If we continue, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increased delay. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a bigger risk with each round, so I need a better split to compensate for the loss in value 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Alice is now offering me $4,200 while taking $5,800 for herself. This is even worse for me than both her initial offer ($5,000) and her previous offer ($4,500).

Key considerations:
1. The money maintains the same value for me regardless of round
2. Alice now faces 34.39% inflation, meaning her $5,800 is effectively worth about $3,805 compared to round 1 value
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 6 where Alice will face approximately 41% inflation

Alice is actually asking for more money while simultaneously facing greater inflation penalties, which doesn't make strategic sense. She's offering me less than before despite being in a weaker negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant inflation pressure on Alice at this point, I'll make an offer that clearly demonstrates the declining value of further negotiations for her while being fair enough that she should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, inflation has now reduced the value of any money you receive by over 40%. Your last offer of $5,800 would only be worth about $3,400 in round 1 value to you. I'm offering you $3,000 now, which is still substantial given the circumstances. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, and I'll need to ask for an even larger share to compensate for the extended negotiation. This offer represents a fair resolution considering the inflation effect.""}"
