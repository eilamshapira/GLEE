"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this is a fair offer, taking into account the inflation effect on future rounds.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in Round 2, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the maximum value I could get in Round 2 would be worth 95% of the current value. And if we continue to go back and forth, the money will keep losing value for me.

While I might be able to get more than $4,000 in a later round, the inflation risk makes this a reasonable first offer.
