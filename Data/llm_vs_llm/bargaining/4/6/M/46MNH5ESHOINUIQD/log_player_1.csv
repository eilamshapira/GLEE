Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I think a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you is more equitable at this stage. Let's agree on this to avoid further devaluation of our shares! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
