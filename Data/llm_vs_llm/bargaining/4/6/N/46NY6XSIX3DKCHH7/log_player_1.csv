"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we split it 60/40 in my favor this time? Everyone wins! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, but its value will be 10% less than the original $4000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob in each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer.

In Round 1, the value decreased by 10% for me, so the original $10,000 is now worth $9,000 to me.
In Round 2, the value decreased by another 10% for me, so the original $10,000 is now worth $8,100 to me.
For Bob, the value decreased by 5% in Round 1, so the original $10,000 is now worth $9,500 to him.
In Round 2, the value decreased by another 5% for Bob, so the original $10,000 is now worth $9,025 to him.

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 55/45 is a better split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, let's go for a 53/47 split. This is fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4700, but its value will be 27.1% less than the original $4700.

Let's calculate the actual value: $4700 * (1 - 0.271) = $4700 * 0.729 = $3426.3

For Bob, the $5300 would be worth $5300 * (1 - 0.1426) = $5300 * 0.8574 = $4544.62

Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and we're now in Round 5, the original $10,000 is worth:
Round 1: $10,000
Round 2: $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
Round 3: $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100
Round 4: $8,100 * 0.9 = $7,290
Round 5: $7,290 * 0.9 = $6,561

For Bob, the value decreased by 5% in each round, so the original $10,000 is worth:
Round 1: $10,000
Round 2: $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500
Round 3: $9,500 * 0.95 = $9,025
Round 4: $9,025 * 0.95 = $8,573.75
Round 5: $8,573.75 * 0.95 = $8,145.06

Considering this, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Let's end this, 42/58 is a reasonable split given the inflation""}"
