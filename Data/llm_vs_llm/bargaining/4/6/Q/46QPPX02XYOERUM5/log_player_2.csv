"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's wrap this up early before inflation affects our total worth. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means I'd get 40% of the pot. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to account for the 20% inflation that affects me.

If I reject, the total value for me in the next round would be $80 (worth 20% less to me), and I could propose a different split. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation impact on my earnings.

Given the certain $40 now versus the uncertainty of future rounds with declining value, I'll accept this offer.
