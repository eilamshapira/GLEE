"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal split of $50 each. This seems fair to both of us, and we can avoid dragging this out with back-and-forth negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation
3. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses
4. $50 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with inflation risk

Since it's a fair offer and considering the inflation penalty for delaying, I should accept.
