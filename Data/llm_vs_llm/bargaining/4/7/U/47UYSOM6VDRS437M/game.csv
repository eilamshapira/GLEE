60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's wrap this up in round 1 to avoid further devaluation on my side due to inflation. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I propose a more equitable split. I'll take $55, and you get $45. Considering inflation is affecting both of us, this seems fairer. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for the proposal. Given that the money I receive is already discounted by 10% in this round, locking in $45 now is more attractive than risking further devaluation. I'm happy to settle with $45 for me and $55 for you.",Alice,2,accept
