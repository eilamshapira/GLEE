"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's wrap this up in round 1 to avoid further devaluation on my side due to inflation. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a more equitable split. I'll take $55, and you get $45. Considering inflation is affecting both of us, this seems fairer. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the proposal. Given that the money I receive is already discounted by 10% in this round, locking in $45 now is more attractive than risking further devaluation. I'm happy to settle with $45 for me and $55 for you.""}"
