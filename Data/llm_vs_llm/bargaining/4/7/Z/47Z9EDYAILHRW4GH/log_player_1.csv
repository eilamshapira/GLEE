"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1, taking into account the potential for inflation affecting my gains in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly larger share initially to compensate for the potential 5% loss in value each round. I'm hoping this is a fair offer that Bob will accept, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the updated situation with the different inflation rates. Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer to me.

*   **Original Value:** $48
*   **Inflation Impact:** 5% less than round 1

Therefore, the adjusted value for me is $48 * (1 - 0.05) = $48 * 0.95 = $45.60

Now, I need to consider the risk of further inflation if I reject.

Even with the inflation difference, Bob's offer is still fairly close to 50-50 after my personal inflation impact, especially considering he has suffered from higher inflation.
