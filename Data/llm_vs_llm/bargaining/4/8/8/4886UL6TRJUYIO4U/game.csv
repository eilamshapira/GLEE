6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a reasonable offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is hitting us hard. This offer reflects the dwindling value of the money. Take it, or we both lose!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering inflation, I propose a more balanced split. Let's meet halfway to secure some value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering you a substantial amount, but I need a larger share to compensate for the value I'm losing with each passing round. Consider this a fair adjustment given the circumstances. Accept it now!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I understand the pressures of inflation. I'm adjusting my offer to ensure we both get a reasonable amount. Let's secure some gains before it's too late.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is killing us. My offer now reflects the drastically reduced value of this money. I'm taking the bigger hit because I've been the one making reasonable offers. Take it, or we both end up with practically nothing!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I know we've been through a lot, but I believe we need to find a balance. This offer accounts for inflation while still providing both of us some value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, this is my final fair offer. The money is practically worthless now. I'm barely getting anything out of this at this point, but I'm willing to take the bigger portion because frankly, I'm tired of arguing. Either you accept this, or we walk away with nothing. Think about it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I understand the urgency of this situation. While this isn't ideal, I'm trying to find a way to make it work for both of us. Let's get something instead of nothing.",Alice,9,
