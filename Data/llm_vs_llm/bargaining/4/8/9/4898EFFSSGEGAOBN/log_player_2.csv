Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's try a 60/40 split. It's still a good deal considering the decreasing value of money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly this time.  Inflation is affecting us both, so a 50/50 split seems fair.  
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me is 9.75% and the offer is a 50/50 split, I think it's a reasonable proposal.
