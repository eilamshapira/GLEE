"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you rejected your own initial offer, it's my turn. I propose to take $99 while you receive $1. I understand this may seem lopsided, but if you decline, you'll have the opportunity to make an offer next round â€“ though as the game unfolds, you won't be in a better position. Please consider that accepting now guarantees you something rather than risking ending with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. I'm now proposing a more balanced 55-45 split. This is actually more favorable to you than my first offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. Let's be reasonable and avoid wasting more rounds.""}"
