Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, since you rejected your own initial offer, it's my turn. I propose to take $99 while you receive $1. I understand this may seem lopsided, but if you decline, you'll have the opportunity to make an offer next round â€“ though as the game unfolds, you won't be in a better position. Please consider that accepting now guarantees you something rather than risking ending with nothing.""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. I'm now proposing a more balanced 55-45 split. This is actually more favorable to you than my first offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. Let's be reasonable and avoid wasting more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. A 55-45 split is reasonable, and I'd prefer to secure a fair outcome rather than risk further rounds. Let's agree on this division.""}"
