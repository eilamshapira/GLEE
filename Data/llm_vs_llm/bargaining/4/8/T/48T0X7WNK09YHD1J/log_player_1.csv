"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since inflation will reduce the value for me by 20% each round, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to secure a good amount upfront, avoiding inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is now worth 20% less to me, which means it's effectively worth $400,000 in round 1 terms. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, the money would be worth another 20% less to me (worth only 64% of the original value). This means even if I got a larger share in the next round, its actual value to me could be lower.

Given that inflation affects me more severely than Bob (20% vs 10%), and that the 50-50 split is objectively fair, I should accept this offer.
