"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
- If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round for me
- $400,000 now is better than $440,000 next round (due to 10% inflation)
- There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
- This is a reasonable first offer, giving me 40% of the total

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting a good enough offer early more valuable than risking future rounds.
