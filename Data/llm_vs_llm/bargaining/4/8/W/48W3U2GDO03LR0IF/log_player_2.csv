"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The money maintains its full value for me in next round
4. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
5. This means I might be able to negotiate a better deal since Alice has more urgency

Given these factors, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer. The fact that Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't gives me negotiating leverage.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Given that:

1. Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't
2. Alice would only get 90% value in this round
3. I should offer something that's better for Alice than waiting another round
4. But I can use the depreciation factor to my advantage

I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I think this is fair because for Alice, $45 now is worth more than potentially getting more in a future round due to the 10% depreciation she faces per round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me slightly (from $40 to $42.50)
2. For Alice, the $57.50 she's asking for is actually worth only $46.58 (81% of $57.50) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where Alice's money will be worth even less (29% less than round 1)
4. I still have the advantage since my money maintains its value
5. We still have 9 rounds left, giving me room to negotiate

Since Alice's money is losing value quickly and my position is stronger, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. The depreciation of Alice's value will likely make her more willing to accept a better offer for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me strategize:

1. Alice has now faced 3 rounds of depreciation, and any money she gets will be worth 29% less than round 1
2. My money maintains full value
3. Alice's previous offer showed she's willing to take $57.50 (worth only $46.58 to her)
4. I need to make an offer that's attractive given her depreciation, but better for me

Given that Alice is facing significant depreciation, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer is actually reasonable for Alice because:
- Her $40 will be worth about $28.40 due to the 29% depreciation
- If she waits another round, any money she gets will be worth even less
- My previous offer of 55/45 was rejected, so I'm increasing my ask but still leaving her with a meaningful amount"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $45 (full value)
2. Alice would get $55, but it's only worth $36.09 to her (65.61% of $55 due to 34.39% depreciation)
3. Her offer has improved for me (from initial $40 to now $45)
4. We're now 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds remaining
5. Alice's money will continue to depreciate by 10% each round
6. She seems to be gradually increasing my share as her money loses value

While I could hold out for more, there's also risk in pushing too hard:
- Alice's offers are becoming more reasonable
- $45 is a decent share for me (especially compared to the risk of getting nothing if we go all 12 rounds)
- The next few rounds will see Alice's value decrease further, but she might become more stubborn

I think this is a fair enough offer given the circumstances. I'll accept.
