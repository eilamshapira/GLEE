55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money devalues faster (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slight advantage for me at 55/45. This is equitable considering the time value impact.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I believe a 60/40 split is more reasonable. This accounts for the faster devaluation of your share, making it relatively fair over time.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about the inflation rates, but 40/60 is too skewed. Let me compromise with a 53/47 split. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, this is actually quite fair. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose due to inflation, so let's find a middle ground now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but considering the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your share, I believe a 57/43 split is more suitable. The longer we negotiate, the more your share devalues, making this proposal relatively generous.",Bob,4,
