"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money devalues faster (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slight advantage for me at 55/45. This is equitable considering the time value impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I believe a 60/40 split is more reasonable. This accounts for the faster devaluation of your share, making it relatively fair over time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about the inflation rates, but 40/60 is too skewed. Let me compromise with a 53/47 split. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, this is actually quite fair. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose due to inflation, so let's find a middle ground now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but considering the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your share, I believe a 57/43 split is more suitable. The longer we negotiate, the more your share devalues, making this proposal relatively generous. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57
