"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money devalues faster (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slight advantage for me at 55/45. This is equitable considering the time value impact. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I believe a 60/40 split is more reasonable. This accounts for the faster devaluation of your share, making it relatively fair over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the inflation rates, but 40/60 is too skewed. Let me compromise with a 53/47 split. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, this is actually quite fair. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose due to inflation, so let's find a middle ground now. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, 
""alice_gain"": 43, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but considering the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your share, I believe a 57/43 split is more suitable. The longer we negotiate, the more your share devalues, making this proposal relatively generous.""}"
