"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if Bob rejects, I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split since it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects, they'll have to propose next round when the total value will be worth less due to inflation (at least for me)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4700, but with 10% inflation = $4230 effective value
   * Bob gets $5300, with 5% inflation = $5035 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But money will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
   * Further delays risk even more value loss

Given that:
1. The offer is reasonably fair (47% vs 53% split)
2. Inflation is hurting me more than Bob
3. Further negotiations will reduce the real value significantly
4. The difference between this and my initial proposal isn't large enough to justify another round of inflation
