"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting doesn't hurt my position
5. I can likely negotiate a better deal

Given that there's no downside to rejecting (no inflation for me), and I can potentially get a better deal in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I have the power to make the offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose we split the money $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
