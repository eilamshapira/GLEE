"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $500,000 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round but with 5% less value
5. A fair split with no risk is a good deal
