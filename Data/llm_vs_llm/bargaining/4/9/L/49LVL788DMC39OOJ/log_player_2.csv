"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can find a better balance. How about this division? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 81% of $4000 (since it's 19% less than the original), which is approximately $3240, and Alice's offer gives her 64% of $6000 (since it's 36% less than the original), which is approximately $3840. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 29% less (10% in round 1 + 10% in round 2 + 9% in round 3, but for simplicity, we consider the total depreciation over rounds) than in the first round, and the money Alice gains is worth 48% less (20% in round 1 + 20% in round 2 + 8% in round 3, considering total depreciation).

Let's aim for a division that considers these depreciations.
