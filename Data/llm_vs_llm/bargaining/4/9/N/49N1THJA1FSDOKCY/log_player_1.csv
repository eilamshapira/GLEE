"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but accounts for inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. I'm asking for slightly more because I face 20% inflation each round, so if we don't reach an agreement now, the money will be worth less to me in future rounds."
