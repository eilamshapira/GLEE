"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

1. The offer is close to a 50-50 split, with me getting 45% and Alice getting 55%
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me:
   - $1M Ã— 0.95 = $950,000 total value for me
   - My maximum potential gain would be reduced due to inflation

The current offer of $450,000 is likely better than what I could get after inflation in subsequent rounds, and it's a reasonably fair split.
