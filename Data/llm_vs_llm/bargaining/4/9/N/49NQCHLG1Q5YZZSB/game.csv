5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We both get $5000 each, which is an equitable division of the money. This way we can both walk away satisfied with the outcome.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Okay Bob, since you rejected, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the lost time (and inflation on my side). Let's end this now with a reasonable split.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you, which is why I'm suggesting a more balanced split where you still get a bit more. This 52%-48% division acknowledges your inflation concerns while moving closer to fairness. Let's settle this now so neither of us loses more value with additional rounds.",Bob,4,
