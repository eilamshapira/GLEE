"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split to get this done quickly. Let's take our share and move on! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider the inflation factor and the limited number of rounds.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% as mentioned), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I should aim for a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We both get $5,000 each, which is an equitable division of the money. This way we can both walk away satisfied with the outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, since you rejected, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the lost time (and inflation on my side). Let's end this now with a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's updated offer:

Alice is now offering me $4,200 out of the $10,000, which is 42% of the total amount. This is a $200 improvement from her initial offer of $4,000.

She mentions that inflation affects her side, which explains why she's still asking for more than half. I notice that inflation is reducing the value of her money by 9.75% per round, while my money retains its value.

While $4,200 is still less than half, considering the inflation affecting Alice and the limited number of rounds, this offer shows movement in my direction. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you, which is why I'm suggesting a more balanced split where you still get a bit more. This 52%-48% division acknowledges your inflation concerns while moving closer to fairness. Let's settle this now so neither of us loses more value with additional rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's try this. I'm giving you a bit more this round. This is my final offer. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's latest offer:

Alice is now offering me $4,300, which is $100 more than her previous offer and $300 more than her initial offer. She's now giving me 43% of the total.

The inflation on Alice's side has increased to 18.55% from the first round, which means her $5,700 is worth less to her than it would have been in round 1.

Given that:
1. She's calling this her ""final offer""
2. Inflation continues to affect her more than me
3. We've already gone through 5 of our 12 rounds
4. She has shown willingness to make incremental increases

While I could try for more, there's a risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement. My money doesn't lose value, but getting some portion is better than potentially getting nothing.
