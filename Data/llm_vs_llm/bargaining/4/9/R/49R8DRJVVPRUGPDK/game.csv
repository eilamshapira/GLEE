555556.0,444444.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I get $555556 and you receive $444444. This split reflects our options under the 20% devaluation per roundâ€”waiting only reduces our total pot. Let's agree now and avoid unnecessary loss.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split of $500000 each. This is actually more beneficial for you than your original offer would be after one round of devaluation. If we move to another round, we'll both lose significant value. An equal split respects our equal positions in this negotiation and allows us both to walk away with maximum combined value.",Bob,2,
