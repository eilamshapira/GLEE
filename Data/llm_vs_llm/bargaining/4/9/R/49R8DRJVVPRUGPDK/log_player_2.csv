"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I get $555556 and you receive $444444. This split reflects our options under the 20% devaluation per roundâ€”waiting only reduces our total pot. Let's agree now and avoid unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $444,444 while she gets $555,556 out of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount would be worth 20% less ($800,000 total), but I'd get to make the next offer. That means I could potentially propose getting more than $444,444 even after the devaluation.

Since I would control the next offer and could propose a more favorable split for myself (potentially up to $500,000 or more of the $800,000), Alice's current offer doesn't seem optimal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the declining value while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split of $500,000 each. This is actually more beneficial for you than your original offer would be after one round of devaluation. If we move to another round, we'll both lose significant value. An equal split respects our equal positions in this negotiation and allows us both to walk away with maximum combined value.""}"
