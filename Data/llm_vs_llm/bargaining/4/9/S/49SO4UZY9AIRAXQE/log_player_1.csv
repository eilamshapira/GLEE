"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share of $5000, and we can conclude this quickly before any inflation effects come into play. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the 20% inflation penalty per round, my $5000 is now worth $4000 in round 1 terms. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, I'll face another 20% penalty, making it harder to get a better outcome. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is reasonable, and accepting now is better than risking further value loss through inflation."
