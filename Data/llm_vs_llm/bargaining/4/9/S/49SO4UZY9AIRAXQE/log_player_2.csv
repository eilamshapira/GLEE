"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. While the split favors her, it's not an extreme proposal
3. It's true that I won't lose any value to inflation if I accept now
4. We still have 11 rounds left, so I could counter-offer
5. However, there's risk in prolonging negotiations, and 40% is a substantial amount

Given that it's a reasonable first offer and I don't lose anything to inflation, I could accept. However, I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable split, and since it's early in the game, I'll make a counter-offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share of $5,000, and we can conclude this quickly before any inflation effects come into play.""}"
