"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering the 5% inflation per round, I want to secure a good amount early on.

My offer is:
```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this carefully, considering inflation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 5% less each round.
*   **Bob's perspective:** His money is worth 20% less than in the first round.
*   **The offer:** Alice gets $50, Bob gets $50.

Since the money is worth less this round, the amount I receive should be more or equal to the amount I received in the first round to compensate for the inflation.

Since I was offered $60 in the first round, and now I am offered $50, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Since I rejected Bob's offer of $50 in the last round and my money is worth less each round, I need to be aggressive.

My offer is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's break this down again.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** Money is worth ~14.26% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Money is worth ~48.8% less than in round 1.
*   **The offer:** Alice gets $55, Bob gets $45.

In round 1, I was offered $60. Now, I am offered $55, but my money's value has decreased. I need to factor that in.

Since the value of money I would receive in round 4 has decreased much less than the offer, I should accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
