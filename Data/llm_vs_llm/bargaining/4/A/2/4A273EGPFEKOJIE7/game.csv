999000.0,1000.0,"I propose a fair division, taking into account the potential for inflation. I'll take 999000, leaving 1000 for you. This way, we both have something to work with, and I'm confident that we can make it through the game.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $500000, which is truly equitable. There's no inflation for me, and I respect that we both deserve an equal share of the total amount. This balanced division ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum.",Bob,2,

950000.0,50000.0,"I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but I have to account for inflation. It's now 5% less valuable for me than the previous round. I'm offering you 50000, which is still a good deal, considering the inflation.  Let's work together to make this fair for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I understand your concerns about inflation. While I'm not affected by inflation, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a 60-40 split in your favor. This gives you $600000 and me $400000, which accounts for any inflation you might be experiencing while still giving us both substantial portions. This is a fair compromise that addresses both our interests.",Bob,4,
