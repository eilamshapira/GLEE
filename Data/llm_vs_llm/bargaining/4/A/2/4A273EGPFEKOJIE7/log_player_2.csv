"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, taking into account the potential for inflation. I'll take 999000, leaving 1000 for you. This way, we both have something to work with, and I'm confident that we can make it through the game. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is extremely uneven, offering me only $1,000 out of $1,000,000 while she takes $999,000. This is nowhere near a fair division. Even though there's no inflation for me, accepting such a small fraction (0.1%) of the total would be unreasonable.

I should reject this and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $500,000, which is truly equitable. There's no inflation for me, and I respect that we both deserve an equal share of the total amount. This balanced division ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but I have to account for inflation. It's now 5% less valuable for me than the previous round. I'm offering you 50000, which is still a good deal, considering the inflation.  Let's work together to make this fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is claiming inflation affects her, but her offer is still extremely unbalanced. She's offering me only $50,000 (5% of the total) while taking $950,000 (95%) for herself. This is not close to a fair division, even considering potential inflation on her side.

The prompt states that inflation makes the money worth 0% less for me, so I have no time pressure to accept unfair offers. Even if Alice faces some inflation, her current proposal is still heavily skewed in her favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about inflation. While I'm not affected by inflation, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a 60-40 split in your favor. This gives you $600,000 and me $400,000, which accounts for any inflation you might be experiencing while still giving us both substantial portions. This is a fair compromise that addresses both our interests.""}"
