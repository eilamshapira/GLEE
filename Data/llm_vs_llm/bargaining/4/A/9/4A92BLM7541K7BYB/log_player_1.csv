"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that this is a relatively generous offer to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance in the first round and avoiding the inflation penalty. I'm giving Bob a significant portion while still prioritizing my own gain."
