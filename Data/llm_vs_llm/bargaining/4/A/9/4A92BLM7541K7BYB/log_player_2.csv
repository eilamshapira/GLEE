"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round (so my maximum potential gain would be reduced)
2. We only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing
3. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject
4. 40% is a reasonable first offer, though not ideal

Given that inflation will eat into future negotiations and we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I think this is a decent enough first offer to accept. The cost of prolonged negotiation could exceed the potential gains from getting a slightly better deal.
