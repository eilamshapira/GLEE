"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Inflation will drastically impact our offers as the rounds progress, so it's important to be relatively fair and get an agreement early.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm asking for slightly more ($2) to reflect that I am making the first offer and perhaps to account for the inherent slight advantage in being the proposer.
*   It's close to an even split to encourage acceptance in the first round, avoiding the inflation penalty. I don't want to be too greedy and risk rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is the inverse of mine. Given that we're already in round 2 and the money is worth less, and his offer is still very close to 50/50, I'll accept.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
