Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to compensate for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we can both walk away happy without dragging this out.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to account for the 10% total inflation penalty I'm now facing. This split is fair considering I'm losing value each round while you aren't. Let's agree and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is exaggerating the inflation penalty. While it's true she's losing value, framing it as a 10% total penalty after only two rounds is misleading. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is still too skewed in her favor."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now facing a 19% inflation penalty. Your $4000 is still worth $4000, while my $6000 would actually be worth about $4860 to me. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Please accept so we can both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate and using increasingly manipulative tactics.  She's framing the deal as if my gains are equivalent across all rounds while hers are drastically reduced.  This ignores the fact that *getting a deal at all* is valuable to me, and the longer this goes on the more likely we are to get nothing. 

I need to signal I'm willing to concede *something*, but I won't be emotionally manipulated."

This offer is my final concession.  Let's settle this now and avoid walking away with nothing.""}"
