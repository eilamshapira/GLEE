"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split: $5000 for each of us. Let's settle this now and avoid any unnecessary rounds or inflation losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me
   - Even if I propose a better split, Alice might reject
3. This is a fair initial offer
4. Taking inflation risk for potentially small gains doesn't seem worth it
