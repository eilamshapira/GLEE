Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's slightly better than her last offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, and the inflation is working against me.  I need to aim for a more equitable split."

This is getting frustrating. Alice continues to offer slightly better deals but they are nowhere near a fair split, especially considering the rapid inflation. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a better deal."

The rate of increase in her offers is too slow, and the inflation is eating away at the potential gains.  This is getting dangerous."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000} 

This is a risky move, as it's a larger jump in my favor. However, with the inflation accelerating, I need to make a strong statement and hope Alice understands the urgency."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is incredibly frustrating, as her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, but with the inflation at this rate, I need to cut my losses. Accepting a poor deal is better than getting nothing."
