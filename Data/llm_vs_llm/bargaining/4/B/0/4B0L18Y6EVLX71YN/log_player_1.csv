"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, and I'm Alice. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the future inflation that will hurt me more than him. I need to balance getting a good amount now with making the offer appealing enough that Bob accepts it.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Bob's Offer:** I get $400,000, and he gets $600,000.

*   **Inflation:** This is crucial. My money is now worth 20% less than in round 1. So, $400,000 now is equivalent to $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 in round 1 terms. Bob's money is worth 5% less.

*   **Consider rejecting:** If I reject, it will be my turn to make an offer. But on round 3, my money will be worth 40% (20% * 2 rounds) less than in the first round, which will be a big hit.

Let's do a little calculation to see if this is a good deal. My money in round 3 will be worth $1,000,000 * 0.6 = $600,000
So, it is in my best interest to accept Bob's offer.
```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
