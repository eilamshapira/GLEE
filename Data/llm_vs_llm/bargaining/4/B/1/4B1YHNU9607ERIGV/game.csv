600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 10% each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $400000 right now. If you decline, your next maximum gain would be worth less to you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer ensures a more equitable split while still factoring in the time constraint.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, consider that if you reject this offer, any money you receive next round will be worth 30% less to you. This offer of $350000 now is worth more to you than $400000 would be next round. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want this settled. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and reflects a reasonable split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 37.1% depreciation you're facing, this $300000 now is worth more to you than $475000 would be next round. We're approaching halfway through our rounds, and your position weakens each time. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, this offer represents a fair deal considering the remaining time and the diminishing value. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, consider the math carefully: This $250000 now is worth more to you than $480000 would be next round due to your 47.86% depreciation. Your previous offers have been getting worse despite your weakening position. We have 5 rounds left, and each round significantly reduces your money's value. This is a rational offer given the circumstances.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. This is a fair and final offer. Let's be sensible and avoid losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, we only have 3 rounds left before we both get zero. Due to 56.95% depreciation, this $200000 now is worth more to you than $465000 would be next round. Your last offer wasn't realistic given your depreciation - you offered yourself $600000 that would only be worth $286980 to you. Time is running out, and this offer ensures you still get meaningful value rather than risking getting nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this now before we both lose out.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, this is critical: We have only ONE round left after this before we BOTH get ZERO. If you reject this, any money you get in the final round will be worth 68.62% less to you. This $150000 now is worth more than $478000 would be in the final round. Your last offer of $500000 would only be worth $193700 to you - this offer is actually better for you in real value. Take this offer, or we risk walking away with nothing.",Alice,11,
