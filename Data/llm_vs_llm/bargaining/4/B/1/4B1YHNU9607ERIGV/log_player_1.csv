"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer considering that Bob faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't. I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but not too aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 10% each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $400,000 right now. If you decline, your next maximum gain would be worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer ensures a more equitable split while still factoring in the time constraint. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which is still worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $550,000, which is actually worth $495,000 to him due to 10% depreciation
3. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but then Bob's money will be worth even less to him
4. We still have many rounds left, but every round makes Bob's position weaker
5. I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my first offer and I rejected his counter, I'll adjust my offer slightly but maintain a strong position, considering Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him if he rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider that if you reject this offer, any money you receive next round will be worth 30% less to you. This offer of $350,000 now is worth more to you than $400,000 would be next round. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want this settled. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and reflects a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Bob's offer:
1. Bob is offering me $400,000 (full value)
2. Bob wants $600,000, but due to 27.1% depreciation, it's only worth about $437,400 to him
3. If I reject, the next round will see Bob's value depreciate further to 37.1%
4. This offer is worse for me than his previous offer, which suggests Bob isn't negotiating realistically
5. Given that Bob's position weakens each round and this offer is worse than before, I should reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that we're now in round 5 and Bob's money has significantly depreciated in value, I'll maintain a strong position. Any money Bob receives now will be worth 37.1% less to him if he rejects this offer.

{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 37.1% depreciation you're facing, this $300,000 now is worth more to you than $475,000 would be next round. We're approaching halfway through our rounds, and your position weakens each time. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer represents a fair deal considering the remaining time and the diminishing value. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Bob's offer:
1. Bob is offering me $350,000 (full value)
2. Bob wants $650,000, but it's only worth about $383,825 to him due to 40.95% depreciation
3. His offers are getting worse for me, not better, despite his increasingly weaker position
4. We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob's value will depreciate to 47.86% next round
5. Bob seems to be playing against his own interests by not making more reasonable offers as time passes

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now that we're in round 7, with Bob's money worth 47.86% less if he rejects, I'll make a strong offer that emphasizes the increasing urgency for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider the math carefully: This $250,000 now is worth more to you than $480,000 would be next round due to your 47.86% depreciation. Your previous offers have been getting worse despite your weakening position. We have 5 rounds left, and each round significantly reduces your money's value. This is a rational offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a fair and final offer. Let's be sensible and avoid losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Bob's offer:
1. Bob is offering me $400,000 (full value)
2. Bob wants $600,000, but it's only worth about $286,980 to him due to 52.17% depreciation
3. With 4 rounds left, Bob's money will depreciate to 56.95% next round
4. This offer is actually identical to his round 4 offer, which makes no sense given his much weaker position now
5. Bob is not negotiating rationally - he's offering me less than in round 2 despite his money being worth less than half its original value now

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's money now worth 56.95% less if he rejects, and only 3 rounds remaining, I'll make a strong offer that emphasizes the increasing risk of both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, we only have 3 rounds left before we both get zero. Due to 56.95% depreciation, this $200,000 now is worth more to you than $465,000 would be next round. Your last offer wasn't realistic given your depreciation - you offered yourself $600,000 that would only be worth $286,980 to you. Time is running out, and this offer ensures you still get meaningful value rather than risking getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Bob's offer:
1. Bob is offering me $500,000 (full value)
2. Bob wants $500,000, but it's only worth $193,700 to him due to 61.26% depreciation
3. Only 2 rounds remain before we both get nothing
4. This is actually Bob's best offer yet in terms of my share
5. However, given the extreme depreciation and that I can make one more offer, I should still reject

The fact that Bob is now offering a better deal shows he's finally understanding his position, but it's still not reflecting the reality of the depreciation he faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With only one round remaining after this and Bob's money now worth 65.13% less if he rejects, I'll make a final strong offer that emphasizes the imminent risk of both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is critical: We have only ONE round left after this before we BOTH get ZERO. If you reject this, any money you get in the final round will be worth 68.62% less to you. This $150,000 now is worth more than $478,000 would be in the final round. Your last offer of $500,000 would only be worth $193,700 to you - this offer is actually better for you in real value. Take this offer, or we risk walking away with nothing.""}"
