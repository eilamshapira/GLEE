"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair division that accounts for the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself since I face 10% inflation per round if we delay, while Bob's inflation rate is unknown to me. This is still a very reasonable offer giving Bob a substantial portion while protecting me from inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- A 50-50 split would normally be fair
- However, due to inflation, my $5000 is actually worth 10% less ($4500 in round 1 terms)
- While Bob's $5000 is only worth 5% less ($4750 in round 1 terms)
- If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but my share will be worth even less
- Better to lock in a reasonable amount now than risk further devaluation
