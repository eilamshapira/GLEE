"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but its value will be 20% less than the original value. So, the effective value I'll get is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
