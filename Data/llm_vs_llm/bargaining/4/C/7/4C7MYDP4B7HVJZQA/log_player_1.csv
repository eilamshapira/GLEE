"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that's fair but also takes into account the inflation effect that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, so getting a deal done early is important for me. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion while keeping a slightly larger share to account for my inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
