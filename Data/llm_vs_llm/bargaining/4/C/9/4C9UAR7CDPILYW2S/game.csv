83.33,16.67,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so neither of us loses value with delay. Given that each round costs me only 5% but costs you 20%, this division reflects our time‐preferences. I’m offering you $16.67 – which is as good as you can expect if you wait to propose – ensuring an immediate, fair agreement. What do you think?",Alice,1,

33.33,66.67,"Hi Bob, considering our respective discount factors this round—my dollars are worth 90% of their face value and yours 60%—I’ve calculated our continuation values. If you reject this offer, you’d become the proposer next round, but with a steeper discount (only 40% effective for you), leaving you with roughly the same effective value of about $40 on the whole pie. To avoid that risk and lock in a fair immediate value, I propose you receive $66.67 (which is worth about $40 for you) and I keep $33.33 (worth about $30 for me). This offer ensures both of us get as much as we could realistically expect moving forward. What do you say?",Alice,3,
