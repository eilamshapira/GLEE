"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83.33, ""bob_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so neither of us loses value with delay. Given that each round costs me only 5% but costs you 20%, this division reflects our time‐preferences. I’m offering you $16.67 – which is as good as you can expect if you wait to propose – ensuring an immediate, fair agreement. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe I deserve a bit more. I'm offering you $80 and keeping $20 for myself. Let's make this work and ensure we both benefit! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33.33, ""bob_gain"": 66.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering our respective discount factors this round—my dollars are worth 90% of their face value and yours 60%—I’ve calculated our continuation values. If you reject this offer, you’d become the proposer next round, but with a steeper discount (only 40% effective for you), leaving you with roughly the same effective value of about $40 on the whole pie. To avoid that risk and lock in a fair immediate value, I propose you receive $66.67 (which is worth about $40 for you) and I keep $33.33 (worth about $30 for me). This offer ensures both of us get as much as we could realistically expect moving forward. What do you say?""}"
