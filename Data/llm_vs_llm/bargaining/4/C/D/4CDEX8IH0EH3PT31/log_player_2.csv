"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the pot
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 10% less
   - Her money will be worth 5% less
   - She might reject my offer, leading to further inflation

While 40/60 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject and we go back and forth, inflation will eat into both our shares, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
