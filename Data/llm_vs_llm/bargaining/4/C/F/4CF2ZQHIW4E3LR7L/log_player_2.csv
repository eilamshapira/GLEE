"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair, given the 20% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, I can counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be reduced to 8,000$ for me.

Alice is offering me 4,000$ out of 10,000$ (40%). If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, even if I propose to take 7,000$ (70%), that would be worth 5,600$ to me after the 20% inflation.

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's risk in negotiation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
