"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation impact.

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a straightforward 50-50 division, which seems fair for both of us. Since you face 10% inflation per round while I don't, accepting this equal split now would be financially advantageous compared to waiting for future rounds."
