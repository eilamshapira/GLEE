"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair and efficient offer to Bob in the first round, considering that if we delay the decision, we both risk losing value due to the 10% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is the fairest division. This way we can both walk away with equal shares and avoid any loss due to inflation in later rounds."
