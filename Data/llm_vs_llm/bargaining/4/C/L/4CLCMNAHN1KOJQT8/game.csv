52.5,47.5,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division where I get $52.5 and you get $47.5. This is actually a fair split when considering the 5% inflation you face each round. If we go to round 2, your $47.5 would only be worth $45.125 to you due to inflation, so this offer is better for you than a 50/50 split next round.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it didn't feel fair considering the inflation only affects me. I propose a 50/50 split this round. Given the inflation, this would be equivalent to you getting $52.5 last round, which is what you proposed. Let's end this fairly.",Bob,2,
