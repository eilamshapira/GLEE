"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52.5, ""bob_gain"": 47.5, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division where I get $52.5 and you get $47.5. This is actually a fair split when considering the 5% inflation you face each round. If we go to round 2, your $47.5 would only be worth $45.125 to you due to inflation, so this offer is better for you than a 50/50 split next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it didn't feel fair considering the inflation only affects me. I propose a 50/50 split this round. Given the inflation, this would be equivalent to you getting $52.5 last round, which is what you proposed. Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
