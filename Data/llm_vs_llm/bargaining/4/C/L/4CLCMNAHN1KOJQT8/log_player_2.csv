"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division where I get $52.5 and you get $47.5. This is actually a fair split when considering the 5% inflation you face each round. If we go to round 2, your $47.5 would only be worth $45.125 to you due to inflation, so this offer is better for you than a 50/50 split next round. 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it didn't feel fair considering the inflation only affects me. I propose a 50/50 split this round. Given the inflation, this would be equivalent to you getting $52.5 last round, which is what you proposed. Let's end this fairly.""
