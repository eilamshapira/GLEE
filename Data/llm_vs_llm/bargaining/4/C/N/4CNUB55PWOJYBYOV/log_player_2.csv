"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. While she framed it as ""generous,"" the actual split gives me only 10% of the total sum ($100,000) while she keeps 90% ($900,000). This seems quite unbalanced given that we're starting from an equal position.

Since this is only the first round of potentially 12 rounds, I have plenty of opportunity to make a counter-offer. If I reject, I'll get to make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a fair 50-50 split makes the most sense. We both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a significant amount. This way, we both benefit equally from this opportunity.""}"
