"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% devaluation per round while I don't, he has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Bob has offered me $550,000, which is less than my initial proposal but still a good amount. Since I'm not affected by inflation, this $550,000 is worth the full value to me. 

If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but Bob will be facing another 5% inflation penalty, making him more likely to accept a better deal for me. However, there's also the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to neither of us getting anything if we don't agree within 12 rounds.

Given that this is still a relatively good offer early in the negotiation (only round 2) and I'm getting more than half, I'll accept this offer.
