"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the 5% inflation for me:

Since this is round 2, my money is worth 5% less than the original value. That means $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000 to me.  To make it worth Alice's time, I'll offer a bit more.
