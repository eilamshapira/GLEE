"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, knowing that the value of the money depreciates each round differently for me and Bob. I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept it now, considering his depreciation is faster than mine.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the depreciation. The initial value of $1 for me is now worth $0.90. For Bob, the initial value of $1 is now worth $0.80.

Bob's offer is: Alice gets $4000, Bob gets $6000.

If I accept, I get $4000 * 0.90 = $3600 effectively.
If I reject, I get to make an offer in Round 3, but the money will depreciate further.

I need to decide if the potential gain in Round 3 outweighs the $3600 I'm being offered now. The depreciation will make it harder to offer something Bob will accept, because *his* money is depreciating faster.

Let's consider what happens if I reject. In Round 3, my money will be worth 0.81 and Bob's will be worth 0.64 relative to round 1. This makes the decision far less easy, as Bob will likely be aware that accepting will lead to a much lower final value.

Given the rapid depreciation for Bob, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
