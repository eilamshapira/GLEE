"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer from Alice. She's proposing an even 50-50 split where we both get $5,000. Since inflation reduces the value by 5% each round, accepting now means we both get the full value. If I reject, the total value would decrease and we might end up with less overall even if I propose a different split next round.
