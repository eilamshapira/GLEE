550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 5% depreciation penalty I face. If we delay, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives us both substantial gains.",Alice,1,

950000.0,50000.0,"Alice, time is of the essence â€” every round delays your share by 5%. To avoid further depreciation, I'm offering you 950000 nominal dollars now (which secures you 902500 in real value) while I take 50000. This deal maximizes your value immediately compared to what you'd get if you waited another round. I hope you'll agree to a prompt settlement.",Bob,2,
