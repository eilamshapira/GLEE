"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob and include a message.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 5% depreciation penalty I face. If we delay, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives us both substantial gains.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is of the essence â€” every round delays your share by 5%. To avoid further depreciation, I'm offering you 950000 nominal dollars now (which secures you 902500 in real value) while I take 50000. This deal maximizes your value immediately compared to what you'd get if you waited another round. I hope you'll agree to a prompt settlement. 
# Alice gain: 950000 
# Bob gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
