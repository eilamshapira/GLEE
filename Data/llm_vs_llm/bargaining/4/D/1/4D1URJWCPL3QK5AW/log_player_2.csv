"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 5% depreciation penalty I face. If we delay, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives us both substantial gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50000, ""alice_gain"": 950000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is of the essence â€” every round delays your share by 5%. To avoid further depreciation, I'm offering you 950,000 nominal dollars now (which secures you 902,500 in real value) while I take 50,000. This deal maximizes your value immediately compared to what you'd get if you waited another round. I hope you'll agree to a prompt settlement.""}"
