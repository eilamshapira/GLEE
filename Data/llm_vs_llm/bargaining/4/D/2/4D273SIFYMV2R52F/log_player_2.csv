"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm Bob, and I'm considering Alice's offer in this first round. 

Let me analyze this situation:
- Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
- If I reject and we go to round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- Each round means further depreciation of value
- I get to make a counter-proposal if I reject

While the offer isn't 50/50, it's a reasonable starting position. However, I believe I can achieve a better outcome by making a counter-proposal in the next round. The 5% inflation penalty is small enough that it's worth trying to negotiate a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to consider, especially given that she faces a higher inflation penalty (10%) than I do (5%).

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Alice. This is a fair division that accounts for the fact that you face higher inflation costs than I do if we continue negotiating. Let's reach an agreement quickly so we both maximize our gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm carefully considering Alice's new offer in round 3.

Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split in my favor. This shows she's willing to negotiate and has made a meaningful concession. 

If I reject again:
- The money will depreciate further (I'm already facing a 9.75% depreciation)
- Alice is facing a steeper 19% depreciation (nearly double mine)
- We're now in round 3 of 12 possible rounds

Given that Alice has moved toward a more balanced split, and considering the accelerating depreciation we both face (especially Alice), this seems like a reasonable offer. While I could push for more, the risk of continued depreciation makes this a good point to reach agreement.
