"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I (Alice) face a 10% depreciation per round while Bob doesn't. This gives Bob some incentive to accept early, but also leaves room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I need to account for potential depreciation if negotiations extend to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% depreciation, if I accept Bob's offer now:
* I would get $500,000 Ã— 0.9 = $450,000 in round 1 value
* Bob would get $500,000

If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my gains will be worth another 10% less (20% total depreciation). I would need to secure a significantly higher amount to make up for the depreciation, and Bob might reject again.

Since this is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms (though less for me in real terms due to depreciation), and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept.
