"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a significant amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. To make a fair offer, I'll calculate based on this reduced value.

{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. This offer aims to be reasonable while accounting for the decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need to adjust for inflation. This offer aims to be more balanced while still considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money I would gain is reduced by 36% from the original, which means if I were to get $4600, its actual value to me would be approximately $4600 * (1 - 0.36) = $2944.

Given this significant reduction in value due to inflation, and comparing it to Alice's offer, I need to weigh the potential benefits of negotiating further against the risk of losing more value due to inflation in subsequent rounds.
