"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice has proposed that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. I know that:
1. I don't lose value to inflation in future rounds
2. I can counter-offer if I reject
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

However, since this is just the first round and I don't lose value to inflation, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. A 40-60 split seems a bit too favorable for Alice when we're just starting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I'll propose a more balanced split but still give her a slight advantage to encourage acceptance. A 45-55 split should be more fair while still being attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

This offer gives me a better deal than the previous one while still being generous enough to Alice to potentially secure an agreement. It's a reasonable improvement from the previous 40-60 split without being too aggressive in the negotiation."
