"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. A generous offer for you to take, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth less to me
4. Still, $100,000 is quite a small share of the total amount
5. Even with inflation, I could propose a more favorable split next round

Given that this is just the first round and the offer is quite low (only 10% of the total), I'll reject it. I can make a better counter-offer next round, and even with 10% inflation, I should be able to secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer. Since I rejected Alice's low offer, I'll propose a more equitable split while accounting for the fact that we're now in round 2 and I'm facing inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that benefits us both. This is a fair offer considering we still have many rounds ahead, and waiting longer will only reduce the value for both of us due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a more equitable split. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth $243,000 to me
2. This is better than her first offer of $100,000
3. If I reject, my next counter-offer will be subject to even more inflation (29%)
4. Alice seems to be gradually increasing her offers
5. However, $300,000 (worth $243,000 to me) is still only 30% of the total

While this is a better offer than the first one, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Even with increasing inflation, we have several rounds left, and Alice seems to be moving towards more favorable splits.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and increase her offers, and considering that inflation is significantly impacting my gains, I'll make a reasonable offer that should be attractive to both parties:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're both losing value as time passes - I'm already facing 29% inflation on my gains. This is a fair split that gives you a substantial amount while recognizing my position. Let's conclude this deal now before further inflation diminishes our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer leaves us both with a significant sum. Let's be reasonable and finalize this before inflation further devalues the money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $350,000, but with 34.39% inflation, it's actually worth about $229,635 to me
2. Alice keeps gradually increasing her offers ($100K → $300K → $350K)
3. We're now in round 5 of 12, so inflation will continue to significantly erode my gains
4. If I reject, my next counter-offer will face even higher inflation
5. The pattern suggests Alice understands she needs to increase offers, but she's doing it slowly
6. We're approaching a point where inflation is seriously impacting my potential gains

Given the accelerating impact of inflation and the upward trend in Alice's offers, this might be a reasonable time to accept. While I might get a higher nominal amount by continuing, the real value could be lower due to inflation.
