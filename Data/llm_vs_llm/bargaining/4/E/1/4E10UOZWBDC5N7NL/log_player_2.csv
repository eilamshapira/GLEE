"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unfavorable to me, as she's proposing to take 90% of the money while giving me only 10%. Since inflation affects Alice more strongly than me (10% vs. 5% per round), I have an advantage in going to the next round, where I can make a more equitable proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because if Alice rejects, we'll go to round 3 where she'll face 10% inflation on her offer, while I'll only face 5% inflation. Given this asymmetry, this division recognizes our relative bargaining positions while still offering Alice a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider how our inflation rates affect the value of this offer.

Alice's new offer gives me 400,000 which, after 9.75% inflation, is worth about 361,000 of round 1 dollars to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face additional 5% inflation (total 14.75%), and Alice will face additional 10% inflation (total 29%).

This offer of 400,000 is much better than her initial 100,000 offer, showing we're moving toward a more reasonable division. Since the inflation penalty affects Alice more severely, she has stronger incentive to reach an agreement now.
