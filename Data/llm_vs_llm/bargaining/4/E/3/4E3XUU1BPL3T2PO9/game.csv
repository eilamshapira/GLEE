60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This compensates for my higher risk while still giving you a good portion. Let's make a deal now to avoid both of us losing value.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand your point about the higher inflation rate, but I believe a 55-45 split in your favor is too steep given we're only in the second round. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, considering our inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 3, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This takes into account your higher inflation rate but also reflects the urgency to settle before the value decreases further. What do you say?",Alice,3,
