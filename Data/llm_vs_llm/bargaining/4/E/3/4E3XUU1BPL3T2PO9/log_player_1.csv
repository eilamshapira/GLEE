Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This compensates for my higher risk while still giving you a good portion. Let's make a deal now to avoid both of us losing value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your point about the higher inflation rate, but I believe a 55-45 split in your favor is too steep given we're only in the second round. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering our inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 3, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This takes into account your higher inflation rate but also reflects the urgency to settle before the value decreases further. What do you say?""
