"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, next round:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - I can make a counter-offer

Alice's offer isn't great, and since it's early in the game (round 1 of 12), I have room to negotiate. Even with the inflation penalty, I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a counter-offer:
1. Given that my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Alice's (10%), I should try to get a better deal now
2. However, I need to be reasonable to avoid prolonged negotiations that hurt us both
3. A 55-45 split in my favor would be fair considering the inflation rates

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This compensates for my higher risk while still giving you a good portion. Let's make a deal now to avoid both of us losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering our inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 3, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This takes into account your higher inflation rate but also reflects the urgency to settle before the value decreases further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice offers me $45, but due to 36% inflation, it's effectively worth about $28.80
2. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be even worse (about 49% from original)
   - I can make another offer, but the value keeps decreasing significantly
3. Alice's offer is actually more generous than her first one
4. We're already in round 3, and with 12 rounds total, prolonging this will hurt us both
5. The offer seems reasonable given the circumstances and inflation rates
