"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, taking into account the inflation I'll face in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more aggressive offer, prioritizing a larger share for myself. This is because I know the money will be worth less to me in later rounds. I hope Bob will see the benefit of accepting a guaranteed $400,000 now rather than risk further negotiation."
