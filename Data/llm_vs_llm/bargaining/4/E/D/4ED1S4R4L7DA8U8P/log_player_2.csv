"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$. If I reject, there will be inflation:
- For me: 20% reduction per round
- For Alice: 5% reduction per round

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- My 4000$ would be worth only 3200$ (20% less)
- Alice's 6000$ would be worth 5700$ (5% less)

Given:
1. The significant inflation penalty for me (20%)
2. Alice has a much lower inflation penalty (5%)
3. We only have 12 rounds
4. This is still a decent offer (40% of total)

I think it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation through negotiations.
