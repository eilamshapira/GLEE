"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair. While I understand you tried to leverage our different inflation rates, such an imbalanced offer wasn't reasonable. This equal division respects both of our interests. Let's avoid dragging this out since we both lose value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
