"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous offer. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk too.  Hope we can reach a deal quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000. This is just 10% for me and 90% for her, which seems quite unbalanced.

Given that inflation affects me more (10% per round) than Alice (5% per round), waiting does hurt me more. However, if I reject this offer, I get to make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Even with 10% inflation, I could propose a much more equitable split in round 2 that would still give me more than $100,000 in present value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation differences.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair. While I understand you tried to leverage our different inflation rates, such an imbalanced offer wasn't reasonable. This equal division respects both of our interests. Let's avoid dragging this out since we both lose value with each round.""}"
