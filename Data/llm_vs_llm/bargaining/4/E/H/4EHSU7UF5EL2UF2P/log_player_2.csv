"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer: I get $400,000, Alice gets $600,000
2. If I reject:
   * I can make the next offer
   * The money will be worth 10% less to Alice (but same for me)
   * I could potentially get a better deal since Alice faces depreciation

Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. Her $600,000 would only be worth $540,000 to her next round, while my money maintains its value.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal next round that's more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I know Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor, but still attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round of depreciation.

If Alice rejects my offer, her portion would be worth 10% less next round, so she should be motivated to accept a reasonable offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because:
1. It's better for me than her initial offer
2. For Alice, $450,000 now is better than potentially getting less in real value next round due to the 10% depreciation
3. It's still a reasonable enough offer that she might accept to avoid further negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $460,000, Alice gets $540,000
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $460,000 is worth full value
   * Alice's $540,000 is worth only $437,400 to her (81% of $540,000)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round Alice will face 29% total depreciation
   * I can make another offer
   * I might get an even better deal

However, Alice's current offer is already better for me than her first offer ($460,000 vs $400,000). While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's also a risk of prolonging negotiations unnecessarily. This is a decent improvement from the initial offer, and the absolute amount I'm getting is meaningful.

I'll accept this offer.
