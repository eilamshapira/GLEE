"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, I'll make an offer that acknowledges inflation affects me, while trying to establish a fair starting point.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. I'm requesting slightly more in the first round because inflation affects me by 20% each round, reducing the value of any future payment. If this doesn't work for you, we can negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, the inflation effect has increased for me. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I propose I receive $5,800 and you receive $4,200. I need to request more to offset the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing each round. My effective value is already reduced to 64% of the original amount (80% of 80%). A fair division should account for this decreasing value on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 5, the inflation effect has compounded further for me. I need to account for this in my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}

I propose I receive $6,200 and you receive $3,800. With five rounds of inflation, my money is worth only about 41% of its original value (0.8^4 = 0.41). This significant decrease means I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair effective value. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce my value even further, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon."

Round 6
