Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is getting worse, accepting it now means losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings due to inflation. I'm hoping Alice will be more open to a fairer deal as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:** 

Given the increasing inflation, offering a 50/50 split seems like a rational choice. It signals fairness to Alice while still aiming for a reasonable payout for myself.  The risk of walking away with nothing is becoming increasingly significant as we approach the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The offer is getting worse, and the inflation is cutting deeply into potential gains. However,  there's still a significant amount of money on the table. Accepting such a low offer at this stage would set a bad precedent for future negotiations. I'm betting Alice will be more amenable to a fairer deal as the rounds progress and the pressure of losing everything mounts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

**Reasoning:**

I'm conceding a bit more to Alice in this offer, acknowledging that time is not on our side due to the inflation. This offer still allows me to secure a reasonable amount, and the slightly higher share for Alice might make it more appealing considering the increasing risk of getting nothing as we approach the later rounds."
