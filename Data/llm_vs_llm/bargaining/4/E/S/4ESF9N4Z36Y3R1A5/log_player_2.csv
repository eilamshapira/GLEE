"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value will be worth 5% less for me
   * $100 * 0.95 = $95 total value for me next round
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject

While $40 isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. If I reject, I risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and value loss.
