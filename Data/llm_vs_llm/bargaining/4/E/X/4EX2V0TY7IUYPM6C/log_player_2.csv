Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I value our partnership. Let's start with this fair division.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is quite unbalanced, giving me only 10% of the total amount. While I value partnership, a more equitable distribution would be more appropriate. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, considering that the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation."
