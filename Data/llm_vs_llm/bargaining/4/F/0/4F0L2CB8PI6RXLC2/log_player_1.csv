"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial share, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Even though it's worth 10% less due to inflation, it's still a fair division and continuing to negotiate would only lead to further value loss through inflation. A 50-50 split worth 90% of the original value is better than risking further rounds of negotiation."
