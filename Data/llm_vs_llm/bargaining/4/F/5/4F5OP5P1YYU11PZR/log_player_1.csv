"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer to divide the $100. Since I'm facing inflation and Bob is not, I should take that into account in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we divide the money with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a fair offer considering that any delay will cost me 10% of the value in the next round, while Bob loses nothing by waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While this gives me less than my initial proposal, due to the 10% inflation penalty for me, waiting further would only reduce the value of any money I receive. Since Bob doesn't face inflation, he has a stronger negotiating position as the game progresses. A 50-50 split in round 2 means I effectively get $45 in round 1 value, which is better than risking further depreciation of my share in subsequent rounds."
