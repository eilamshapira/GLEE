"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally, ensuring fairness for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $500,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less, so I would actually get $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation in future rounds.
