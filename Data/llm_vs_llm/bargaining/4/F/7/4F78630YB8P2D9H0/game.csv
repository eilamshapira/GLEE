400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's consider the inflation factor. For me, the money doesn't lose value over rounds, but for you it depreciates 10% each round. My proposal gives you $400000 now, which is better than getting potentially less later after several rounds of depreciation. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.",Bob,2,
