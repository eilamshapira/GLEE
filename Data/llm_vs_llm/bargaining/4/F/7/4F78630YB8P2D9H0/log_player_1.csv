Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's consider the inflation factor. For me, the money doesn't lose value over rounds, but for you it depreciates 10% each round. My proposal gives you $400000 now, which is better than getting potentially less later after several rounds of depreciation. This is a fair offer considering our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
