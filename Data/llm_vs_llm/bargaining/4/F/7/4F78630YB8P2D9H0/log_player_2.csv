"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get a bit more to account for future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. This isn't a fair split given that we're dividing $1,000,000. 

She mentions accounting for future inflation, but the rules state that inflation only affects her, not me. With each round, the money is worth 10% less to Alice, while it remains the same value for me.

Since I don't lose value over time, I should reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic proposal that considers our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I face 0%, I have a stronger negotiating position.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's consider the inflation factor. For me, the money doesn't lose value over rounds, but for you it depreciates 10% each round. My proposal gives you $400,000 now, which is better than getting potentially less later after several rounds of depreciation. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.""}"
