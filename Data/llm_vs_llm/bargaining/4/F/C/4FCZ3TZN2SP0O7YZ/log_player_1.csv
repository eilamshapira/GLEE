Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both walk away equally satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair and equitable split that gives us both equal value. It's better to secure a good outcome now than risk future rounds where we might both end up with nothing."
