"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. While Alice's reasoning about taking initiative is interesting, a 60-40 split is tilted significantly in her favor. Since we have multiple rounds ahead and I believe a more equitable distribution is possible, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's fair to both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both walk away equally satisfied.""}"
