6000.0,4000.0,Let's split this fairly. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I’m aiming for a fair deal that protects us both from further loss due to inflation. I propose a nearly equal split: I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we lock in our gains before the value decreases further. Looking forward to your positive response.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"I'm increasing my offer slightly to account for the inflation. I'll take $6500, you get $3500. This is still better than getting nothing later!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, with each round the total value diminishes further, it's in both our interests to settle now. In round 4 the money is worth only about 73% of its original value, so we can't afford to wait. I’m proposing a nearly even split—with a slight lean to me based on the current dynamics—ensuring you get $4800. Let’s secure our earnings before inflation does more damage. I look forward to your acceptance.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Inflation is hurting us both. To end this, I'll take $7000 and you get $3000. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing and we both secure something now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, the cost of delay is becoming too steep—our total value has dropped significantly now, and further waiting will hurt us both. To secure a deal that reflects the urgency of the situation, I'm offering a slightly generous split in your favor: you get $5200 and I take $4800. Let's settle now and salvage as much value as we can before more inflation hits. I hope you'll agree.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"The value is eroding fast. This is my final offer. I'll take $7500, and you get $2500. Take it or we both lose everything.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
9050.0,950.0,"Alice, the relentless erosion leaves us with very little bargaining power. If we continue, you'll have the advantage as the next proposer, but the overall pie will shrink even further. By accepting my offer now, you secure an effective value slightly better than the almost‐entire pie you could get later. I know it's hard to see, but this is our best shot at preserving any value at all. Please, let's agree before inflation takes everything away.",Bob,8,
