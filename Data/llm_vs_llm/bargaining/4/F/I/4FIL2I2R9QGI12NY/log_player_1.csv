Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I’m aiming for a fair deal that protects us both from further loss due to inflation. I propose a nearly equal split: I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we lock in our gains before the value decreases further. Looking forward to your positive response.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round the total value diminishes further, it's in both our interests to settle now. In round 4 the money is worth only about 73% of its original value, so we can't afford to wait. I’m proposing a nearly even split—with a slight lean to me based on the current dynamics—ensuring you get $4800. Let’s secure our earnings before inflation does more damage. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the cost of delay is becoming too steep—our total value has dropped significantly now, and further waiting will hurt us both. To secure a deal that reflects the urgency of the situation, I'm offering a slightly generous split in your favor: you get $5200 and I take $4800. Let's settle now and salvage as much value as we can before more inflation hits. I hope you'll agree.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the relentless erosion leaves us with very little bargaining power. If we continue, you'll have the advantage as the next proposer, but the overall pie will shrink even further. By accepting my offer now, you secure an effective value slightly better than the almost‐entire pie you could get later. I know it's hard to see, but this is our best shot at preserving any value at all. Please, let's agree before inflation takes everything away.
