In round 4 the money is worth only about 73% of its original value, so we can't afford to wait. I’m proposing a nearly even split—with a slight lean to me based on the current dynamics—ensuring you get $4800. Let’s secure our earnings before inflation does more damage.

If we continue, you'll have the advantage as the next proposer, but the overall pie will shrink even further.

I know it's hard to see, but this is our best shot at preserving any value at all. Please, let's agree before inflation takes everything away.""}"
