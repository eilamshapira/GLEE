Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. Since the money's value remains constant for me, I'm willing to take a larger share. Let's see how much this is worth to you considering your inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
