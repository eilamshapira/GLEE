4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you. Since the money I receive loses 10% of its value each round, I'm motivated to settle this quickly. I think it's a fair offer that gives you a slight advantage, ensuring you get a bit more if you accept now. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree in round 1!",Alice,1,
