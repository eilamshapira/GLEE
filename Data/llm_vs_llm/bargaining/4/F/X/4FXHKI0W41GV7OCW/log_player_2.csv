"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you. Since the money I receive loses 10% of its value each round, I'm motivated to settle this quickly. I think it's a fair offer that gives you a slight advantage, ensuring you get a bit more if you accept now. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree in round 1! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
