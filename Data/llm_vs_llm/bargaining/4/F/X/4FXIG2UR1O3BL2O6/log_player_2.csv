Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, the nominal amount is still $10,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount. I'll propose a 50-50 split, but since I want to incentivize Alice to accept, I'll give her a slightly larger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 392.15 
# Alice gain: 9607.85 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is significantly reduced. However, Alice's offer seems extremely low for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after the first two rounds (20% + 16% = 36% less, due to compounding), and now another 20% less after this round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $10,000 * 0.512 = $5,120. However, the nominal amount is still $10,000.

For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less after the first two rounds (5% + 4.75% = 9.75% less), and now another 5% less after this round, the actual value she's considering is $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $10,000 * 0.857 = $8,570.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the nominal amount and try to find a middle ground.
