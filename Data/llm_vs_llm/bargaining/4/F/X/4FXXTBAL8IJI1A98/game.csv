5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Due to the 20% inflation that affects me each round, I needed to improve on your initial offer. This even split respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly before further inflation erodes the value.",Bob,2,
