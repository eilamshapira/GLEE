Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""I think this is a fair split considering we both have a stake in the game. Let's finalize this deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Due to the 20% inflation that affects me each round, I needed to improve on your initial offer. This even split respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly before further inflation erodes the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
