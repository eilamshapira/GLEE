"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split considering we both have a stake in the game. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which means she would get $6,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to account for the 20% inflation that would affect my share. If I reject now, the total value to me in the next round would only be worth $8,000 due to inflation.

Given this information, it's better for me to make a counter-offer where I might get more than $4,000, even accounting for the 20% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make my offer considering the inflation effect. I need to offer Alice enough to make it worth her while, while also improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Due to the 20% inflation that affects me each round, I needed to improve on your initial offer. This even split respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly before further inflation erodes the value.""}"
