"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider both Alice's offer and the inflation dynamics. 

Alice has offered me $400,000 while taking $600,000. For me, there's no inflation penalty, so my $400,000 keeps its full value regardless of when we settle. However, Alice faces 10% depreciation per round, meaning her money is worth less if we delay.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Given Alice's inflation penalty, I can potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round and I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself. Given that Alice's money will be worth 10% less next round if she rejects, I'll offer a split that's better than what she'd get if we continue negotiating further.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, Alice. This is a fair offer considering that if you reject and we continue to the next round, the value of your money will decrease by 10%. This offer gives you more present value than you would likely receive after factoring in inflation in later rounds."
