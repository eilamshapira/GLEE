"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider the impact of inflation on my gains. Since my money is worth 20% less, the $500,000 offered to me is effectively worth $500,000 * 0.80 = $400,000 in terms of its original value.

Given this, here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation that affects my gains:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
