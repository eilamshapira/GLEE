"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates affecting both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a fair split that favors me slightly, recognizing that we both face inflation but you face it at a higher rate (10% vs my 5%). If we need to go to another round, we'll both lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more attractive offer considering the increasing effects of inflation on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Since we're now in round 3, inflation has reduced the value further for both of us. I'm offering you a bit more than my previous proposal to find a middle ground. This is a fair split that recognizes the time pressure we both face, but especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's reach an agreement before more value is lost."
