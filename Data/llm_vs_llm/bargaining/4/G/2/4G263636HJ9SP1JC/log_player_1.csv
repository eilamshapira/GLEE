"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```

I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor. I know it's aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept rather than risk inflation and the potential for smaller gains later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
