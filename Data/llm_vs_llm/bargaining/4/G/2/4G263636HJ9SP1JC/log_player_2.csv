"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only 5% of the total amount. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is the most equitable solution and provides maximum benefit for both parties. A fair split will encourage cooperation and mutual benefit."
