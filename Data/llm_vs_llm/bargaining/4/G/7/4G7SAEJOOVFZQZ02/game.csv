7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7000 and you receive $3000. Accepting this now avoids any risks from potential future uncertainty about the money's value. Let's settle this deal promptly!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the potential decrease in value, I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share before the money loses more value. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, given that your amount is currently discounted by 20% and that the value for my share remains unaffected, I believe there's potential for a more favorable proposal if we continue. I'm going to reject this offer so we can proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
3333.0,6667.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $3333 and you get $6667. Here's my reasoning: if you reject and wait until Round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat—but by then, the inflation will have intensified your discount (roughly 60% off your nominal share), leaving you with an effective payoff of about $4000. By accepting now, you secure a nominal $6667, which, even discounted at 40%, is more advantageous than delaying. I believe this is a fair and rational offer given the circumstances. Please let me know if you agree!",Alice,3,
