"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7000 and you receive $3000. Accepting this now avoids any risks from potential future uncertainty about the money's value. Let's settle this deal promptly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the potential decrease in value, I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share before the money loses more value. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, given that your amount is currently discounted by 20% and that the value for my share remains unaffected, I believe there's potential for a more favorable proposal if we continue. I'm going to reject this offer so we can proceed to the next round.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3333, ""bob_gain"": 6667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $3,333 and you get $6,667. Here's my reasoning: if you reject and wait until Round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat—but by then, the inflation will have intensified your discount (roughly 60% off your nominal share), leaving you with an effective payoff of about $4,000. By accepting now, you secure a nominal $6,667, which, even discounted at 40%, is more advantageous than delaying. I believe this is a fair and rational offer given the circumstances. Please let me know if you agree!""}"
