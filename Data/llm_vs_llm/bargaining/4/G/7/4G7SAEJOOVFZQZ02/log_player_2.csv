"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7000 and you receive $3000. Accepting this now avoids any risks from potential future uncertainty about the money's value. Let's settle this deal promptly! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the potential decrease in value, I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share before the money loses more value. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $3333 and you get $6667. Here's my reasoning: if you reject and wait until Round 4, you'll be in the proposer’s seat—but by then, the inflation will have intensified your discount (roughly 60% off your nominal share), leaving you with an effective payoff of about $4000. By accepting now, you secure a nominal $6667, which, even discounted at 40%, is more advantageous than delaying. I believe this is a fair and rational offer given the circumstances. Please let me know if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333
