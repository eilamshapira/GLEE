"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 in a way that considers both of our interests, keeping in mind the inflation affects Bob's valuation but not mine.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, Bob. This is a fair division considering that waiting a round reduces the value of the money for you by 20%. If we go to the next round and you propose an even split, the $50 I'd get would only be worth $40 to you due to inflation, so this offer is essentially equivalent to that outcome but without delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
