"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 10% less
3. 4000$ now is better than 4000$ in the next round (which would only be worth 3600$ to me)
4. However, I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating, even accounting for the 10% loss

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Alice:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose this 50-50 split as it's fair to both parties. While I'm under time pressure due to inflation, an equal split is reasonable and should be appealing to Alice as it gives her a significant improvement over what she would get in many traditional ultimatum games."
