"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value for you, this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decrease in value for me, I still don't think this is a fair split. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already been two rounds, the money is now worth 19% less for me (10% in round 2 + 9% of the remaining 90% in round 3, approximately). Considering this, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob to try to end the game sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, considering inflation""}"
