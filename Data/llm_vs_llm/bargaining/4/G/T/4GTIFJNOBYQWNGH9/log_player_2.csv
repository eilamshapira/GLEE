"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and this is the first round I'm making an offer, I'll take that into consideration. However, for the sake of the game, let's calculate the effective value after one round of inflation for me and Alice. 

For me (Bob), 20% of $10,000 is $2,000, so the value after the first round is $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000.
For Alice, 10% of $10,000 is $1,000, so the value after the first round is $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000.

Given these values, I'll make an offer that seems reasonable, aiming for a bit more than half of the original $10,000, considering the inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing rapidly, Bob.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the original $10,000 is now worth:
- For me (Bob): $10,000 * (1 - 0.20)^2 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400 (since it's the second round of devaluation for me, with 20% less each round).
- For Alice: $10,000 * (1 - 0.10)^2 = $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100 (since it's the second round of devaluation for her, with 10% less each round).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain: $4,500
- Alice's gain: $5,500

Since the money is devaluing rapidly, and my share is decreasing significantly due to the higher inflation rate, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a substantial amount before the value drops further.
