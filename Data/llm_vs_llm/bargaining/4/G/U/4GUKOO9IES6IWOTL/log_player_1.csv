"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers our respective inflation rates. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), we both have incentives to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and it gives both of us a substantial portion of the money without risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we're both trying to maximize our share. Given our different inflation rates, delaying agreement hurts both of us, but Bob more so. Let me propose a more balanced split.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers and acknowledges that we both lose more by continuing to negotiate. Since my inflation rate is lower, I'm willing to compromise but still need a reasonable portion to account for my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're moving toward each other's positions but still haven't reached agreement. With each round, the total value decreases for both of us, especially for Bob. Let me make a more compromising offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is a perfectly fair division that recognizes we both lose by continuing to negotiate. At this point, the money has already devalued significantly for both of us, and a 50-50 split would give us both substantial value rather than risking further rounds of devaluation."
