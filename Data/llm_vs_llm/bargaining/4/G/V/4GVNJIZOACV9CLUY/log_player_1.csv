"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good outcome, but with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that's close to 50-50, acknowledging that early agreement benefits both of us due to the 20% inflation penalty per round."
