"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for her in Round 1.

This is a slightly lopsided division (45%/55%) in Alice's favor. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2, but the total value will decrease by 20% to $8,000. This means even if I got 100% in Round 2, I'd get $8,000, which is less than the total $10,000 now.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and face 20% inflation per round, accepting a reasonable first offer is often strategic rather than risking further devaluation.
