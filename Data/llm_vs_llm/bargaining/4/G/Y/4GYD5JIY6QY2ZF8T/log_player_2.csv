"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a very unfair initial offer from Alice. She's proposing to take 90% of the money ($900,000) while only giving me 10% ($100,000).

Even considering the 20% inflation penalty for rejecting, I would still be better off making a counter-proposal in the next round. After inflation, the total pot would be worth $800,000, and I could propose a much more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more reasonable offer. Since we both should have equal negotiating power, I'll propose a fair split but slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take advantage in the first round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a much more equitable offer where I get 55% and Alice gets 45%. It's fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it, because if she rejects, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round (down to $640,000 total). If she's thinking rationally, she should prefer $450,000 now over the possibility of a smaller amount in the next round."
