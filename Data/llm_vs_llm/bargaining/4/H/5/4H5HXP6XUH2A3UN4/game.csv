550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we delay. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing a significant sum, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is substantial. Let's keep it simple and equitable.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer of a 50-50 split, but since I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty by round 3, I need to account for that. With this offer, I'd effectively get $480000 in round 1 value while you get $400000. This is actually quite fair considering my disadvantage from inflation. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens further, so this is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, since my money doesn't face inflation, I need to prioritize maximizing my share. I'm offering you $450000 which, even with inflation, is still a significant amount. If we continue to later rounds, your position will weaken further due to increasing inflation, so this is a reasonable offer given our different circumstances. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with substantial amounts.",Bob,4,
