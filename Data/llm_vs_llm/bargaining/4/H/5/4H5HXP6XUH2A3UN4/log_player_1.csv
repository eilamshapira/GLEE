"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we delay. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing a significant sum, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is substantial. Let's keep it simple and equitable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of a 50-50 split, but since I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty by round 3, I need to account for that. With this offer, I'd effectively get $480,000 in round 1 value while you get $400,000. This is actually quite fair considering my disadvantage from inflation. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens further, so this is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, since my money doesn't face inflation, I need to prioritize maximizing my share. I'm offering you $450000 which, even with inflation, is still a significant amount. If we continue to later rounds, your position will weaken further due to increasing inflation, so this is a reasonable offer given our different circumstances. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
