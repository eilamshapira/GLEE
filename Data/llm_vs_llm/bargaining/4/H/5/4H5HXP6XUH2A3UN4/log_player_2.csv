"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we delay. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. While Alice is offering me $450,000, which is a substantial amount, she's claiming she faces a 10% inflation penalty while I apparently have 0% inflation according to the game rules. This gives me an advantage in later rounds.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me and I can make a counter-offer in the next round, it seems reasonable to try for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing a significant sum, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is substantial. Let's keep it simple and equitable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of a 50-50 split, but since I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty by round 3, I need to account for that. With this offer, I'd effectively get $480000 in round 1 value while you get $400000. This is actually quite fair considering my disadvantage from inflation. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens further, so this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully. Alice is claiming she faces a 20% inflation penalty in this round (although the message says 19%), which means she's trying to account for this with a larger share. She's offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000.

Since I don't face any inflation according to the game rules, I have an advantage in continuing negotiations. Alice's money seems to be devaluing with each round, while mine isn't. This suggests I could potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds as her position weakens.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, since my money doesn't face inflation, I need to prioritize maximizing my share. I'm offering you $450,000 which, even with inflation, is still a significant amount. If we continue to later rounds, your position will weaken further due to increasing inflation, so this is a reasonable offer given our different circumstances. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
