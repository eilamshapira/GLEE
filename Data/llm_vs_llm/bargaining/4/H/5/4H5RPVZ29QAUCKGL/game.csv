75.0,25.0,"Alice, waiting further will hurt your share even more due to the higher devaluation you face. If you reject and move to round 3, you'll end up with roughly the same effective value as 0.6×100 = 60. Accepting 75 now (which is worth 0.8×75 = 60 to you) avoids further losses. Let's settle this round and secure our gains before the money loses more value!",Bob,2,
