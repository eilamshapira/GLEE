"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting further will hurt your share even more due to the higher devaluation you face. If you reject and move to round 3, you'll end up with roughly the same effective value as 0.6×100 = 60. Accepting 75 now (which is worth 0.8×75 = 60 to you) avoids further losses. Let's settle this round and secure our gains before the money loses more value! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
