60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Accepting now means we both secure our shares before inflation reduces my dollars further in later rounds. I believe this is a fair starting point — let’s lock it in and avoid any future loss.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it equally, $50 each. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we can both walk away with a fair share.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Although the $50 I'll receive in round 2 is worth about $45 in round 1 dollars due to inflation, I value reaching an agreement now instead of risking further value loss. I accept your 50/50 proposal.",Alice,2,accept
