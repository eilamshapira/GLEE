"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Accepting now means we both secure our shares before inflation reduces my dollars further in later rounds. I believe this is a fair starting point — let’s lock it in and avoid any future loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, $50 each. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Although the $50 I'll receive in round 2 is worth about $45 in round 1 dollars due to inflation, I value reaching an agreement now instead of risking further value loss. I accept your 50/50 proposal.""}"
