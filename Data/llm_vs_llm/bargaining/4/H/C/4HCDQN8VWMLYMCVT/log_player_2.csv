"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Accepting now means we both secure our shares before inflation reduces my dollars further in later rounds. I believe this is a fair starting point — let’s lock it in and avoid any future loss. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
