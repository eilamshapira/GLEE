"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

First offer from Alice:
- Bob (me): $100,000
- Alice: $900,000

This is a significantly uneven split (10%/90%). If I reject, inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds, but I'll get to make a counter-offer. Let me consider the inflation dynamics:
- My inflation: 10% per round
- Alice's inflation: 20% per round

Since Alice's inflation rate is higher than mine, waiting slightly favors my negotiating position. I believe I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that considers our relative positions and the inflation dynamics.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me receiving $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This is a fair division that acknowledges both our interests. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs. my 10%), waiting is more costly for you than for me, but I'm still offering you a substantial portion to encourage agreement now rather than extending negotiations further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Current offer from Alice:
- Bob (me): $200,000 (worth 19% less than round 1)
- Alice: $800,000 (worth 36% less than round 1)

This is still quite uneven (20%/80%). Alice has increased my share from $100K to $200K, which shows some movement toward a more equitable split. However, I believe we can reach a more balanced arrangement.

Considering the inflation:
- My effective value now: $200,000 × 0.81 = $162,000
- Alice's effective value now: $800,000 × 0.64 = $512,000

With each round, Alice's portion loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% inflation). This gives me some leverage, but I don't want to extend negotiations too long as we both lose value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our inflation rates and shows I'm willing to move toward a compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair and balanced division that respects both our interests equally. I've reduced my previous ask from $550,000 to $500,000 to demonstrate good faith in reaching an agreement. Given your higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), reaching an agreement sooner benefits you more, and this equal split offers substantial value to both of us without further depreciation."
