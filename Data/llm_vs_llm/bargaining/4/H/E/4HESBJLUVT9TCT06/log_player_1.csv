"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer in Round 1, considering that I face a 20% value reduction per round if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because time is more costly for me than for Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. While an even split might seem fair initially, the asymmetric inflation means I need to secure a reasonable portion now rather than risk further rounds where my effective gain would decrease. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes our different time pressures."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can still propose a more favorable division in the next round, even accounting for the inflation penalty I face."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic given the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and I'm willing to compromise from my initial position. While I face a 40% inflation penalty in this round, delaying further would only reduce my effective gains more significantly. A 50-50 split is the standard for fairness, and I hope Bob recognizes this equitable division."
