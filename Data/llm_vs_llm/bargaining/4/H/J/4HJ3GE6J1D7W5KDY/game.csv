520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $520000 and you receive $480000. Given that the total amount loses 5% value with each round for me, it’s in our mutual interest to agree quickly. I believe this split is fair and expedites our deal before further delays hurt our overall gains. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I think a 52-48 split in your favor is a bit unfair. Considering we both want to avoid further rounds, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial amount while reflecting my own desire to maximize my gain.",Bob,2,

470000.0,530000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now. Given that in round 3 my share is worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation, I’m offering $470000 for myself and $530000 for you. I believe this reflects the dynamics fairly—we both avoid further delays that only erode my share’s value while ensuring you receive full value for your amount. Let’s avoid more rounds and secure a deal now. What do you think?",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I still think there's room for adjustment in my favor. Given that inflation affects your share but not mine, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the future rounds we might have avoided. I propose a 58-42 split, which I believe reflects the current situation fairly.",Bob,4,

380000.0,620000.0,"Hi Bob, acknowledging that my money is now worth only about 81.45% of its original value (an effective 18.55% loss from round 1), I need to adjust our split accordingly. To avoid the risk of even further devaluation on my end and potential breakdown of negotiations, I'm offering a clear 38-62 split: I get $380000 and you get $620000. This offer even improves on your previous round 4 proposal, ensuring you receive more while locking in the deal immediately. I hope you see the benefit of closing now rather than risking further rounds. What do you think?",Alice,5,
