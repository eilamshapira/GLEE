"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $520,000 and you receive $480,000. Given that the total amount loses 5% value with each round for me, it’s in our mutual interest to agree quickly. I believe this split is fair and expedites our deal before further delays hurt our overall gains. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I think a 52-48 split in your favor is a bit unfair. Considering we both want to avoid further rounds, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial amount while reflecting my own desire to maximize my gain. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Given that in round 3 my share is worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation, I’m offering $470,000 for myself and $530,000 for you. I believe this reflects the dynamics fairly—we both avoid further delays that only erode my share’s value while ensuring you receive full value for your amount. Let’s avoid more rounds and secure a deal now. What do you think?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I still think there's room for adjustment in my favor. Given that inflation affects your share but not mine, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the future rounds we might have avoided. I propose a 58-42 split, which I believe reflects the current situation fairly.

Round 5

To avoid the risk of even further devaluation on my end and potential breakdown of negotiations, I'm offering a clear 38-62 split: I get $380,000 and you get $620,000. This offer even improves on your previous round 4 proposal, ensuring you receive more while locking in the deal immediately. I hope you see the benefit of closing now rather than risking further rounds. What do you think?""}"
