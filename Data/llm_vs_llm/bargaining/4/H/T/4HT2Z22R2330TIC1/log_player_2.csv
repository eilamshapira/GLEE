"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500 
# Alice gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite uneven, giving me only 5% of the total amount while keeping 95% for herself. Considering the inflation effect, if I reject this offer, the total value will decrease by 10% for me in the next round, making the pot worth 9,000$ from my perspective. Even with this reduction, I could potentially negotiate a much better split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'd like to propose an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, giving each person exactly half of the total amount. A 50-50 split represents a reasonable compromise that respects both of our interests in this negotiation."
