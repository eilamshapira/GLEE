"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation on your earnings, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you over time, yet still provides you with a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
