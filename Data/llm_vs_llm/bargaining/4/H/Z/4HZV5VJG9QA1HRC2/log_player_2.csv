"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it fairly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation factor that affects only my side.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So instead of $100, we'd be effectively dividing $95 from my perspective.

If I propose a split like 55/45 in the next round to compensate for this inflation, Alice might reject it, and we'd move to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me (90.25% of original value).

Given that Alice made a fair initial offer of 50/50, and considering the inflation penalty I face for delaying, accepting now is likely the best strategy.
