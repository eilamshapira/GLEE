"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the higher depreciation rate I face, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual values for us in this round are:
- For me (Alice), 20% less than the original value, so the $450,000 offered is worth $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000 in real value.
- For Bob, 5% less than the original value, so the $550,000 he keeps is worth $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500 in real value.

Considering this, the offer seems somewhat unfair, but since the value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round, I should weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further depreciation.

However, given that I'm the one facing a higher depreciation rate, and this offer doesn't significantly favor me, I'll choose to reject it, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round or at least minimize my losses due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money's value decreases with each round, and considering the inflation rates:
- My gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, which was already 20% less than the original. So, the value is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.
- Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, which was already 5% less than the original. So, the value is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

To make an attractive offer while considering the depreciation, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the decreasing value but also tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since the last offer from Bob was $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him, and considering the value depreciation, I'll try to make a more balanced offer that slightly favors me to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing.
