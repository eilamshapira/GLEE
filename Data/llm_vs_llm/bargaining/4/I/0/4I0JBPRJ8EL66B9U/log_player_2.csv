"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, while taking $550,000 for herself.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to remember that inflation will affect us differently. The money will be worth 5% less to me (so the full amount would be worth $950,000 to me) and 20% less to Alice (so the full amount would be worth only $800,000 to her).

This gives me leverage to potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since Alice will be more affected by inflation, she might be more willing to accept a more favorable offer from me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our different inflation impacts while being fair enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round compared to my 5%), making a prompt agreement would be in her interest. My offer gives me the majority share but still leaves Alice with a substantial amount. Considering that waiting another round would devalue her potential earnings significantly, this should be an attractive option for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the current inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $480,000, which is better than her initial offer of $450,000. Due to inflation, this $480,000 is worth 9.75% less to me than money in round 1, so it's equivalent to about $433,200 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will further reduce the value - my 5% inflation would compound to about 14.75% less than round 1, and Alice's 20% inflation would compound to about 48.8% less than round 1.

Alice has improved her offer to me, but if I reject, I could potentially make a better counter-offer in round 4 where Alice would face significant inflation pressure. However, we're also risking continued mutual loss of value.

Given that Alice has moved in my direction and considering the growing inflation impact, I'll accept this offer.
