"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I'm playing as Alice and we both want to maximize our gains, I need to consider the inflation penalties for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is close to an even split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer. It's a fair starting point that respects both our interests while acknowledging the different inflation rates we face."
