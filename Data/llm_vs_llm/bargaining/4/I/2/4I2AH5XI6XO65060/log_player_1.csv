"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), I'll propose a slightly larger share for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable split where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. It's balanced enough to have a good chance of being accepted, while accounting for the fact that I'm less pressured by inflation than Bob is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $4,750 at 95% value = $4,512.50
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - Money will be worth 90% for me
   - Money will be worth only 60% for Bob
   - I'll be making the offer again

Since Bob is facing much steeper inflation (20% per round), and I'll have the chance to make the next offer where his money will be worth significantly less, I should reject this offer. I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Bob will be more pressured by inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're in round 3:
- Money is worth 90% of original value for me
- Money is worth only 60% of original value for Bob
- Bob is under more pressure to accept due to his steeper inflation rate

I'll propose a split that takes advantage of this situation while still being acceptable to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 (which at 60% value is still worth $2,400 to him) while I get $6,000 (worth $5,400 to me at 90% value). This is a reasonable offer given our different inflation rates, and Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than letting his value decrease further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Bob's offer:

1. If I accept:
   - I get $6,500 at 85.74% value = $5,573.10
   - This is actually a good offer for me, better than my previous proposal

2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth even less for both of us
   - While I have less inflation pressure, this is actually a favorable offer
   - There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds

Given that this is a very reasonable offer that gives me a good portion of the money at a still decent value, I should accept it. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to continued inflation.
