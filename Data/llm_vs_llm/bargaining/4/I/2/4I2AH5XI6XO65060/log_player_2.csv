"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the inflation rates for both me and Alice.

Given that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and 5% less for Alice, I should evaluate if accepting $4500 now is better than potentially getting more in a future round, considering the decreasing value.

However, since this is the first round, the full value of the money is still intact. I need to think about the strategic aspect of the game as well. If I reject this offer, I will have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the value of the money will decrease for both of us.

Considering Alice's initial offer gives her $5500 and me $4500, it seems somewhat unfair, as it doesn't split the money evenly. But, given the rules of the game and the fact that I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer if I reject, I should think strategically about my next move.

Given the significant decrease in value for me (20%) compared to Alice (5%) per round, it might be beneficial to try to secure a deal early on to avoid losing too much value in subsequent rounds. However, this first offer does not seem particularly generous.

For now, I will reject this offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and this is only the second round, I haven't lost too much value yet. However, I need to be mindful of this significant decrease. For Alice, the money is worth 5% less, which is a more gradual decrease.

To make a fair and strategic offer, I'll aim for a split that is closer to even but also considers the potential future value decreases. An even split would be $5000 each, but given that Alice made an offer that favored her in Round 1, I might try to make an offer that slightly favors me to compensate for the risk of future rounds and the higher inflation rate I'm facing.

However, making an offer that is too biased towards me might lead to Alice rejecting it, which would cause both of us to lose value in the next round. So, I'll make an offer that is somewhat in the middle but still slightly favorable to me, considering my higher risk due to the inflation rate.

Let's propose a split where I get $5250 and Alice gets $4750. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than an even split but still within a reasonable range for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, and now we're in Round 3 with her making a new proposal, I need to carefully consider the current value of the money and the implications of this offer.

The key information here is the effect of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. For me, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. This means that the $4000 offered to me in this round is actually worth $4000 * (1 - 0.36) = $4000 * 0.64 = $2560 in terms of the original value.

For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less, so the $6000 she proposes to take would be worth $6000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $6000 * 0.9025 = $5415 in terms of the original value.

Considering these adjusted values, Alice's offer gives her $5415 (in original value terms) and me $2560. This is a significant disparity and does not seem like a fair split, especially considering the original amount was $10,000.

However, I must also consider the strategic aspect and the fact that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Alice. If I reject this offer, the value of any potential future gain will decrease even further for me.

Given the substantial decrease in value for me and the risk of losing even more value in subsequent rounds, I might be inclined to accept an offer that at least secures some value, even if it's not a perfectly fair split. But, Alice's current offer seems too biased in her favor, considering the original values and the inflation effects.

Therefore, I will reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round, despite the risks and the decreasing value of the money for me.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer in Round 3, it's now my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates and the fact that the money's value has decreased significantly for me (by 36% in two rounds) and less so for Alice (by 9.75% in two rounds), I need to make a strategic offer.

The total decrease in value for me by this round is 36% (from Round 1 to Round 3), and for Alice, it's 9.75%. However, with each round, these percentages are compounded, meaning the actual decrease is more than just additive.

For me, the value decrease from Round 1 to Round 2 was 20%, and from Round 2 to Round 3 was another 20% of the already decreased value, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 or a 36% total decrease from the original. For Alice, it was 5% decrease each round, so 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 or a 9.75% total decrease.

Considering these decreases and aiming to make a fair but strategic offer, I should propose a split that reflects the remaining value and the risk of future decreases. Since I've already lost a significant portion of the potential value due to the higher inflation rate, I need to balance the offer to be attractive enough for Alice to consider but also to ensure I get a reasonable share given the circumstances.

Let's calculate the effective value considering the inflation:
- For me, $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400 (this is what $10,000 is worth to me now, due to inflation).
- For Alice, $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9,025.

Given these effective values and aiming for a compromise, I'll propose a split where I get $3500 and Alice gets $6500. This offer acknowledges the decreased value for me while also considering Alice's relatively better position due to her lower inflation rate.
