"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for future rounds. Let's make it a good start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth $80 (100 * 0.8)
   - But Alice might reject that
   - We could end up in further rounds with even more inflation

While $40 isn't an equal split, it's a reasonable offer considering:
- I avoid the 20% inflation penalty
- It's not far from a fair split
- There's risk in rejection
