"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to think strategically here. Since inflation affects me more (20% per round) than Bob (10% per round), I have more incentive to reach an agreement quickly. However, I also want a fair share.

If we go to Round 2, the $10,000 will be worth $8,000 to me and $9,000 to Bob. This gives Bob some leverage, but I still want to make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split as I believe this is fair and should be acceptable to Bob. With this division, we both receive equal shares, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by concluding the negotiation immediately."
