Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a reasonable offer considering the previous rejections. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is significantly worse for me than Alice's first offer, especially considering inflation. I need to try to negotiate a better deal."
