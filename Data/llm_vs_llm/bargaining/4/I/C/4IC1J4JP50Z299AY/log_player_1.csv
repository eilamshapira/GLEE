"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my proposal for Round 1, keeping in mind the differing inflation rates. I need to factor in that Bob's money is devaluing much faster, making it more advantageous for him to accept an offer sooner rather than later.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering slightly more than half to myself initially.
*   Bob loses 20% of his potential gain if he rejects this offer, giving him an incentive to accept. I believe this offer is relatively fair but weighted slightly in my favor, acknowledging the time value of money and Bob's higher discount rate."
