"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. This isn't a perfectly equal split, but it's reasonably close. 

I need to consider that if I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth only $800,000 to me. Even if I proposed a perfect 50/50 split next round, I'd get $500,000 that would be worth only $400,000 to me due to the 20% reduction.

Since $450,000 now is better than what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round after inflation, I should accept this offer.
