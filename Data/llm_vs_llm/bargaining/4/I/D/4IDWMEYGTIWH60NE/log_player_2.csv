"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value will be 5% less for me. Even if I got more than $5,000 in the next round, I need to factor in this decrease in value.

Since this is the first round and we have equal shares with no inflation impact yet, this is actually a fair offer. If I reject, I risk facing inflation penalties and potentially ending up with less.
