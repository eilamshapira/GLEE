55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair split that benefits us both. I'm proposing 55 for me and 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point considering the time constraint and inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I'm taking a higher share to offset my lower future gains. This split still gives you a substantial amount, and I'm open to negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, round 2 was too steep. Inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm also facing a higher inflation rate. Let's meet in the middle with 52 for me and 48 for you. This is a slight adjustment that still benefits you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I understand your concerns about inflation, but my previous offer was already considering it. Meeting in the middle doesn't account for our different inflation rates. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to prioritize my own gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with it. This is the fairest compromise we can make at this point to avoid losing everything.",Alice,5,
