"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Given the conditions (inflation, limited rounds), I'll propose a split that's heavily in my favor to start, but hopefully still palatable enough for Bob to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 80,
""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think strategically. Accepting this offer gives me $40 now, which is worth 20% less than in Round 1. That means it's effectively worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in Round 1 terms.

If I reject, I get to make an offer in Round 3, but the money will be worth even less. I need to decide if I think I can get more than $32 (in Round 1 terms) by making an offer in Round 3, accounting for further inflation and the risk of rejection.

Given the risk of losing everything and the potential for further inflation eating into my gains, I'll accept this offer.
