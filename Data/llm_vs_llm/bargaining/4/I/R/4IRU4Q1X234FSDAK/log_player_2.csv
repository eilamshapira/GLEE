"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I offer a more balanced split where I get $60 and Alice gets $40. This is fairer than the previous 20-80 split, while still giving me a reasonable advantage as the proposer in this round."
