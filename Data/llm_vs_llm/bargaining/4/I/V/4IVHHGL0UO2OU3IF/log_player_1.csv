Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This accounts for the inflation risk I'm taking, while still giving you a fair portion. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
