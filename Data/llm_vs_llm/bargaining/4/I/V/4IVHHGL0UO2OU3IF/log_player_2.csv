"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer considering the inflation effect. If I reject this round, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me.

Current offer: I get $40, which is 40% of the total.
If I reject and go to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, so $100 would be effectively worth $90 to me.

Let me think about this strategically. Since I can propose next round, I could request a more favorable split, but the total value is decreasing for me. Alice's offer is below 50% but not terribly unfair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I need to make a counter-offer. I need to consider that the $100 is now worth 10% less to me due to inflation, but I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

I'll propose a more equitable split that compensates for my inflation risk but is still attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This accounts for the inflation risk I'm taking, while still giving you a fair portion. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation risk and the fact that we're both trying to maximize our gains, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This seems like a fair split given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's revised offer considering that inflation has now reduced the value by 19% for me since round 1.

Current offer: I get $45, which is 45% of the total.
Due to 19% inflation, $45 is effectively worth about $36.45 to me (45 Ã— 0.81).

If I reject and move to round 4, I'll face even more inflation, and the value will decrease further for me. Also, Alice has already rejected my previous offer of $55 for me/$45 for her, so it's unlikely she'll accept a more favorable split to me in the next round.

Given the diminishing value due to inflation and the back-and-forth nature of our negotiation, this offer is reasonable. If I don't accept now, I risk ending up with even less effective value after more rounds of inflation.
