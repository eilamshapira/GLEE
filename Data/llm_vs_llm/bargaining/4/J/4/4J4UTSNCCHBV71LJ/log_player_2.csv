Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's consider the impact of inflation on Alice's offer. If Alice is willing to offer me $400,000 now, she might be willing to offer more in later rounds, especially as the value of the money decreases for her. By rejecting this offer, I can potentially secure a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
