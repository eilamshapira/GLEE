"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's split it 60/40. I think this is a fair start and will help us both avoid the inflation impact as we proceed. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become $380,000 in the next round
5. Even if I make a better offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses

Given that:
- The current offer is substantial ($400,000)
- The inflation penalty makes waiting risky
- A 60/40 split isn't terribly unfair
- Further negotiations could lead to worse outcomes due to inflation
