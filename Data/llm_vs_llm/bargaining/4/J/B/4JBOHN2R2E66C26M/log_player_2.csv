Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base and adjust my share accordingly.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 19% less, so the actual value for me is $450,000 * 0.81 = $364,500.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.
