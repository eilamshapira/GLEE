"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. Even with inflation, I should be able to propose a much better split for myself

This offer is too low - Alice is trying to take 90% of the money. I should reject and make a more balanced proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that Alice might reject and we'll go to another round (where money will be worth less for me), I'll propose a split that's favorable to me while still being much more reasonable than Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is much more balanced than Alice's initial 90-10 split, while still giving me a good portion. If Alice rejects, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth 5% less for me, but Alice might also be affected by inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $800,000 (80% of the total)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, $800,000 is actually worth about $722,000 in round 1 value
3. I notice Alice is experiencing higher inflation (19%), which explains why she's now willing to make a much more generous offer
4. If I reject, my next offer would be subject to even more inflation
5. This is a very good offer considering the inflation effects

Since $722,000 (the inflation-adjusted value I would receive) is significantly better than what I could reasonably expect to get in future rounds with increasing inflation, I should accept this offer.
