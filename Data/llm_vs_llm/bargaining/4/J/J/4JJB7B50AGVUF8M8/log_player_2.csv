"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'd like to propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both equal shares of $5000. Since time affects us both differently (with my inflation rate being higher), a quick agreement would be beneficial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
