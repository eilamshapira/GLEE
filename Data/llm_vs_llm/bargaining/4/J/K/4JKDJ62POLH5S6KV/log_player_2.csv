"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
- But due to 10% inflation, $100 will be worth $90 next round
- So my maximum potential gain in next round would be diminished
- $40 now is better than potential for slightly more later with risk
