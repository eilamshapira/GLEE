"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose taking $60 for myself and giving $40 to Bob. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a completely fair division, and continuing to negotiate might risk ending up with a worse outcome. This equal split represents a reasonable compromise from both parties."
