"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer, knowing that Bob might reject it. However, it's not so greedy that it's immediately dismissed. I need to consider the potential inflation and want to secure a good portion early."
