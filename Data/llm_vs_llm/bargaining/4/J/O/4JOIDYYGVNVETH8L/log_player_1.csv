"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get a guaranteed $40 right now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can conclude this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
- My previous offer of $60 would only be worth $48 in the next round
- Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $40.5 to me) is not great, but waiting would likely result in even less value
