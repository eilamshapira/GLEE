500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's split the money equally. Even with the 20% inflation for me, this is a fair deal. If you reject, you risk getting less in the next round.",Bob,2,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, consider that if you reject this offer, in the next round your money will be worth 60% less than round 1. This offer gives you more real value than what you'd likely get by rejecting.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, this offer gives you more than my previous offer. Consider that if you reject, I might offer you even less next time. Even with the inflation, this is a reasonable deal for both of us.",Bob,4,

900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, the inflation has severely reduced the value of your money - it's worth 60% less than round 1. This offer of 100000 now is better than a larger amount in the next round which will be worth even less to you. This is your best option.",Alice,5,
