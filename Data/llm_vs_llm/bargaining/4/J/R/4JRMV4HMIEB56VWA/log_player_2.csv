"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Her money will be worth 20% less
   * I can make a counter-offer

The current offer gives me $400,000. If I reject and we move to round 2, any amount I get will be worth 10% less. I would need to secure significantly more than $444,444 ($400,000 รท 0.9) in the next round just to break even.

Given that:
1. This is a decent first offer
2. The inflation penalty is severe
3. We have limited rounds
4. I can't be certain Alice will accept my counter-offer
