60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering inflation hits me harder, let's try 60/40 in my favor. It's only fair given the circumstances.",Bob,2,
40.0,60.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but a 60/40 split in your favor seems too steep for me, especially since my money loses value at a slower rate. Let's see if we can find a middle ground in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, considering both our inflation rates, how about we split it evenly at 50-50 this time? It seems like a fair compromise given our previous rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
