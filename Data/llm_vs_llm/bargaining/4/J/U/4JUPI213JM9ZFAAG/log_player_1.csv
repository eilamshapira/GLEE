"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering inflation hits me harder, let's try 60/40 in my favor. It's only fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but a 60/40 split in your favor seems too steep for me, especially since my money loses value at a slower rate. Let's see if we can find a middle ground in the next round.""
