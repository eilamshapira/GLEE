Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering both our inflation rates, how about we split it evenly at 50-50 this time? It seems like a fair compromise given our previous rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
