 I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a decent amount to start, but also leaves a large portion for me. We have 12 rounds, so there's plenty of time to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still taking the majority. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
