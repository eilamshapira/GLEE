550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering inflation will reduce the value for me by 10% each round. Let's wrap this up now so we both benefit without losing value.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Inflation is eating at the value, and we both know it. I propose a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering I'm taking on the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds.",Bob,2,
