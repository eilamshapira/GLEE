"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering inflation will reduce the value for me by 10% each round. Let's wrap this up now so we both benefit without losing value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Inflation is eating at the value, and we both know it. I propose a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering I'm taking on the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
