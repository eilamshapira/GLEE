"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering inflation will reduce the value for me by 10% each round. Let's wrap this up now so we both benefit without losing value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Inflation is eating at the value, and we both know it. I propose a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering I'm taking on the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds.""
