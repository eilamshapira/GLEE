I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a decent starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. Given the inflation, I'm now offering 700,000 for myself, and 300,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, as it's still a good chunk of money, and better than his last offer."
