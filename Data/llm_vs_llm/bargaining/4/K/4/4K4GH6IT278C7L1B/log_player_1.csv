"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 10% inflation, $5000 is now worth $4500 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. Even if I could get a higher nominal amount in the next round, the inflation penalty might make it worth less than $4500
4. This is a fair 50-50 split from Bob, showing he's being reasonable
5. There's risk in continuing to negotiate with increasing inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and this is a fair split."
