"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split giving me a bit more since I'm affected by inflation. Let's finish this quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation affects you more, I'll take a bit more. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
- Even if I propose and get a better split next round, the inflation will eat into my gains
- $42.75 is still a reasonable amount considering the inflation penalty
