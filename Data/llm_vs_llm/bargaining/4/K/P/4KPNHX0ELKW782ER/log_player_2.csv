{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. How about I take 58 and you take 42? This is a bit more balanced. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
