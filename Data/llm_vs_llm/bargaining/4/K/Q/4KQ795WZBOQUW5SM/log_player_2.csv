"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But due to 20% inflation, if I wait, the $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me
4. Making a counter-offer might result in Alice rejecting, leading to even more inflation
5. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant amount without risking inflation losses
