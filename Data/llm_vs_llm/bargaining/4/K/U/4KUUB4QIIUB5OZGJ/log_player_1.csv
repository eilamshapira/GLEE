"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering the inflation risk if we go through multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while slightly favoring me as the first mover. If Bob declines, my next opportunity will be worth less due to inflation, so this is a fair starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because it's too unfavorable for me, especially considering I'd only get $40 which would be worth even less due to the 20% inflation penalty. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering that my gains are now worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% more reduction each round), I need to adjust my offer to account for this significant inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. I need to ask for more to compensate for the severe inflation penalty on my side, while still leaving Bob with a meaningful amount. If Bob rejects this, we're both risking further value erosion as the rounds continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because $30 with a 48.8% inflation penalty would leave me with very little value. That would effectively be worth only around $15.36 in round 1 terms. Even though rejecting means facing even higher inflation in the next round, this offer is too unfavorable. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that my gains are now worth 68.8% less than round 1 (compounding 20% reduction each round), I need to propose a more aggressive split to compensate for this severe inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose I get $75 and Bob gets $25. This higher split for me is necessary because my $75 is actually only worth about $23.4 in round 1 terms due to the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. Bob's inflation penalty is less severe, so his $25 is still worth more in relative terms. If we continue to later rounds, the value will deteriorate further for both of us, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because $20 with a 67.23% inflation penalty would leave me with only about $6.55 in round 1 value terms. Even though we're halfway through our rounds and the inflation will get worse, this offer is still too unfavorable. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation penalty, but I can still make a counter-offer that would be better for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With my gains now worth 73.78% less than round 1 (compounding 20% reduction each round), I need to maintain a strong position while recognizing we're running out of rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose I get $80 and Bob gets $20. While this might seem high, my $80 is actually only worth about $21 in round 1 terms due to my severe inflation penalty. Bob's inflation penalty is less severe, so his $20 is still worth relatively more to him than what appears on paper. We only have 5 rounds left after this, and the value will continue to deteriorate rapidly. It's becoming critical for both of us to reach an agreement soon to avoid getting nothing at the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's not ideal, we're running out of rounds and the inflation penalty is becoming severe. With my 79.03% inflation penalty, $25 is worth about $5.24 in round 1 terms. If I reject and we continue, my next offer would be subject to even worse inflation, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. It's better to secure some value now than risk further deterioration or complete loss."
