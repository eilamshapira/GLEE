"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should evaluate whether it's better to accept Alice's offer or make a counter-offer.

Alice offers an even 50-50 split where we each get $500,000. This is fair, but I should consider if I can get more by rejecting and making my own offer in round 2.

However, I need to account for the 5% inflation per round. If I reject, the total value becomes $950,000 in round 2, meaning even if I ask for all of it, I'd get less than what's offered now.

The even split is fair, and trying to get more would result in both of us losing value due to inflation.
