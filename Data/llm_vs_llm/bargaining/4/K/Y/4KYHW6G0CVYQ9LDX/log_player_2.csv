"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject and wait until round 2, my potential earnings would be worth less. If I propose a 50-50 split next round, that would be $5,000, but with 20% inflation, it would be worth $4,000 to me - the same as Alice's current offer.

Also, if we keep rejecting offers, we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. Since this is still early in the game and Alice's offer gives me a substantial portion without risking inflation, I'll accept.
