"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the value of money for me is now reduced. The offer is: Alice gains $50, and Bob gains $50.

Let's calculate the effective value for me. In the first round, $1 was worth $1. Now, due to 10% inflation, $1 is worth $0.90.

The offer is $50 for me. The money I get is: $50 * 0.90 = $45

Since Bob's offer is not good enough compared to what I proposed in the first round, I will reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Considering inflation, my money is worth 10% less than in the last round, so effectively 20% less than the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
