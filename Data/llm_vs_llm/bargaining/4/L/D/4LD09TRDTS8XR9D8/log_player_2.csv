"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer of a 50-50 split would be fair in a standard ultimatum game, I need to consider the 10% inflation penalty that affects only my side with each passing round. If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 9,000 to me but still 10,000 to Alice.

This is a fair first offer that gives me half of the full value. If I reject, I risk getting less in actual value even if I negotiate a higher percentage in the next round.
