"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm playing this game as Alice, and I need to make the first offer to Bob. Since there's a 20% inflation impact on my gains for each round, I should propose a reasonable offer that Bob would likely accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I know I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, it's in my best interest to reach an agreement quickly. If you reject this and we go to the next round, the total value will be worth less to me.""}"
