"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I know I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, it's in my best interest to reach an agreement quickly. If you reject this and we go to the next round, the total value will be worth less to me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The $100 will be worth 20% less to me ($80 total value)
   - My maximum potential gain would be less than $80
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

Alice makes a reasonable point about inflation affecting her too, and a 60/40 split isn't terribly unfair. If I reject, I might end up with less due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in the next round.
