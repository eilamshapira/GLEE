"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects me, I should aim for a good deal in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while protecting me from potential inflation losses in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 473684 
# Bob gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $473,684, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so the real value for me is: $473,684 * 0.8 = $378,947

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth another 20% less for me
- I might not get a better deal, and the value will keep decreasing
- Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again

Since Bob's offer gives me a reasonable amount and the value will only decrease further with more rounds, I should accept.
