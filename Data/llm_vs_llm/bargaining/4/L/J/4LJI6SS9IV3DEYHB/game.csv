8000.0,2000.0,Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you 20% of the total. Take it or leave it!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand you want a quick resolution, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Given that I face higher inflation (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a more equitable split. This offer gives you the majority while still respecting my position. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - especially me - so this is a win-win opportunity.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was a starting point. This is a fair split considering the inflation we're both facing and the value of the money is less with each round.",Alice,3,
