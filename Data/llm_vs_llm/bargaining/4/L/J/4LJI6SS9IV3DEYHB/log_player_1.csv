"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a quick resolution, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Given that I face higher inflation (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a more equitable split. This offer gives you the majority while still respecting my position. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - especially me - so this is a win-win opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
