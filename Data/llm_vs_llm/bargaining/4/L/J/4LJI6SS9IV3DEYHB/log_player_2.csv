"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you 20% of the total. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me 20% of the total, I should consider the inflation rates. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me but only 5% less to Alice, which puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations. However, $2,000 out of $10,000 is quite low given that we're supposed to be dividing this fairly.

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to craft a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I'm facing while still seeking a fairer split than the 20/80 Alice proposed.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a quick resolution, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Given that I face higher inflation (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a more equitable split. This offer gives you the majority while still respecting my position. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - especially me - so this is a win-win opportunity.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was a starting point. This is a fair split considering the inflation we're both facing and the value of the money is less with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's new offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for her is much more reasonable than her initial offer. Given that:

1. I face a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs her 5%)
2. We're already in round 3, so my money has lost 36% of its value while hers has only lost 9.75%
3. If we continue to the next round, I'll face another 20% reduction
4. The offer is now approaching a more equitable division

This appears to be a fair compromise considering our different inflation positions. It makes sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
