Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remembering the 5% inflation, and considering Bob rejected my previous offer, I need to be more reasonable. I will also try to account for the 5% loss from the previous round. I also want to make sure I get more than Bob's previous offer to me, or there is no point.
