"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make a fair split. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. This way, we start off strong and avoid the risk of inflation later on. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less for me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $10000, but worth only $8000 due to inflation
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Alice's offer gives me 40% of the total, which isn't extremely fair, but:
1. It's a guaranteed amount
2. Avoiding inflation is valuable
3. There's risk in rejection as Alice might be even less cooperative in later rounds

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer the safer choice.
