"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make it fair and split the $10000 equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer to split the $10,000 equally seems fair, giving us each $5,000. While I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that the total amount would decrease by 5% (to $9,500), meaning even if I got a larger percentage, the absolute value might be less. An equal split in the first round is reasonable and avoids the risk of further inflation.
