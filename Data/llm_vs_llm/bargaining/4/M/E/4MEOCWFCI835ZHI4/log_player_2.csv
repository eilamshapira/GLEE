"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation aspect of this game.

Alice has offered me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. This is less than half, but not dramatically unfair. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to 10% inflation, the total worth to me would only be $900,000, meaning even if I got 100% in the next round (which Alice would surely reject), I'd only receive $900,000 in equivalent value.

Since $400,000 now is better than potentially getting less valuable money later due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
