Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need for more due to inflation, but let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair considering both our needs. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 594000, ""alice_gain"": 406000, ""message"": ""I need to adjust for the increasing inflation. This is still a fair split considering the circumstances.""}

Just to clarify, the amount I'm requesting takes into account the 19.5% inflation I've experienced so far. This means that the actual value of the amount I would receive is approximately equal to the value of $500,000 in the first round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is affecting us both, but I believe this split is reasonable. Let's settle this before it gets too complicated. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

However, I would like to clarify that I'm accepting this offer because it's reasonable at this point in the game. The value of $550,000 in this round is approximately equal to the value of $500,000 in the first round, considering the inflation I've experienced. It's important to note that I'm not accepting because I'm satisfied with the offer, but rather because it's a fair split given the circumstances."
