"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I get $5500 while you receive $4500. Accepting this offer in Round 1 helps us both avoid the inflation penalty that would reduce our gains in future rounds. Let's seal the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10000
2. This is a 45-55 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% next round for me
4. But I'll have the power to make a counter-offer
5. $4500 now is better than $4750 next round (due to 5% inflation)

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. This is a reasonable first offer, and the cost of delay could outweigh potential gains from negotiation.
