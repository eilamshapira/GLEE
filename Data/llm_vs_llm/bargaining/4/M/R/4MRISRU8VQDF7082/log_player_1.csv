"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, keeping in mind the potential for inflation affecting me:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for the potential 20% loss in value if we go to the next round. Bob gets a fair 40%, which should be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

My reasoning: Even considering the 20% inflation, accepting 40$ now is equivalent to accepting 32$ from the initial 100$. Bob is offering the same amount as he would have received in the first round, so there is no value to me in accepting. It is better to make an offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time to make another offer. This round, my money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% * 2 rounds). I need to factor that in.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a larger share this time. 70$ now is worth 42$ from the first round, while Bob receives 30$. I am hoping the diminished value to me, and Bob's comparatively better position, will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

My reasoning:

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer to me. 45$ with a 48.8% loss means the value is:

45 * (1 - 0.488) = 45 * 0.512 = 23.04$

While low, I need to consider that the inflation will increase in the next round (20% on top of the current value). It is unlikely Bob will increase his offer, and continuing to reject would diminish my returns even further. Accepting $23.04 is better than likely getting significantly less."
