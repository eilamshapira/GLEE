"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to divide the $100 between Bob and myself.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is an equal split that's fair for both of us. Since inflation isn't affecting my value for the money, I'm offering a straightforward 50-50 division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. Although it's not an even split, the difference isn't too significant, and accepting now guarantees I receive $45. If I were to reject and make another offer, there's no guarantee Bob would accept my next proposal, potentially leading to further rounds and uncertainty."
