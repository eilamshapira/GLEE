"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, giving you $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value of $10,000 for me is $8,000. To calculate my offer, I'll consider this reduced value.

My proposal is to divide the $10,000 as follows: I'll take $4,500, and Alice will take $5,500.
