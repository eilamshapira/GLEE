500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. Consider that if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you in the next round, while only 10% less to me. This equal division maximizes our combined utility, and we can both walk away satisfied without further inflation reducing the value for both of us.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's end this now. Due to inflation, your money has lost 49% of its value since round 1, while mine has only lost 29%. If we continue, your position weakens more than mine each round. This offer gives you $450000, which is still substantial despite the inflation. If you reject, the next round will cost you another 20% in value, making any future amount worth significantly less to you. This is a fair solution given our different inflation rates.",Bob,4,
