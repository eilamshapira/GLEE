Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. Consider that if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you in the next round, while only 10% less to me. This equal division maximizes our combined utility, and we can both walk away satisfied without further inflation reducing the value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this now. Due to inflation, your money has lost 49% of its value since round 1, while mine has only lost 29%. If we continue, your position weakens more than mine each round. This offer gives you $450000, which is still substantial despite the inflation. If you reject, the next round will cost you another 20% in value, making any future amount worth significantly less to you. This is a fair solution given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
