"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer thoughtfully.

Alice is offering me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $650,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The money will be worth 10% less to me
- The money will be worth 20% less to Alice
- I'll get to make the next proposal

This means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me and only $800,000 to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage, as inflation impacts Alice more severely.

Given the significant difference in our shares ($350,000 vs $650,000) and the fact that I can make a counter-offer next round where inflation hurts Alice more than me, I'll reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being more equitable than Alice's initial proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. Consider that if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you in the next round, while only 10% less to me. This equal division maximizes our combined utility, and we can both walk away satisfied without further inflation reducing the value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.  Take it or I'll be forced to go even lower next time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $400,000 (up from $350,000 in round 1), while she takes $600,000.

Due to inflation:
- The $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $400,000 × (1-0.19) = $324,000 in round 1 terms
- If we go to round 4, the money will be worth 29% less to me and 49% less to Alice than in round 1

If I reject:
- I'll get to make the next offer
- Inflation continues to hurt Alice significantly more than me
- However, the total value for both of us continues to decrease

Given that Alice improved her offer and inflation is seriously eroding our total value, plus the fact that she's still more affected by inflation than I am (giving me leverage for the next round), I'll make a strategic decision.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this now. Due to inflation, your money has lost 49% of its value since round 1, while mine has only lost 29%. If we continue, your position weakens more than mine each round. This offer gives you $450,000, which is still substantial despite the inflation. If you reject, the next round will cost you another 20% in value, making any future amount worth significantly less to you. This is a fair solution given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new equal split offer.

Alice is now offering me $500,000 (a 50-50 split), which is a significant improvement from her previous offers.

Due to inflation:
- My $500,000 is actually worth $500,000 × (1-0.3439) = $328,050 in round 1 terms
- Alice's $500,000 is worth $500,000 × (1-0.5904) = $204,800 in round 1 terms
- If we go to round 6, the money will be worth 41% less to me and 67% less to Alice than in round 1

Key considerations:
1. This is a fair equal split in nominal terms
2. Due to different inflation rates, I'm actually getting more value in real terms
3. The total value continues to erode for both of us
4. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position
5. This matches what I proposed in round 2, though with inflation affecting the real value

Given that Alice has now offered a 50-50 split, which is fair in nominal terms and advantageous to me in real terms due to our different inflation rates, this is a reasonable outcome.
