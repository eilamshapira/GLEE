"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

A 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but with inflation affecting each round, I need to consider my position carefully.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my share would need to be higher than 5000 to match the current value of 5000 due to 10% inflation (I'd need about 5556 to equal today's 5000).

Given that:
1. This is a fair initial offer
2. There's guaranteed value loss if I reject
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
4. We could end up with nothing after 12 rounds
5. First-round acceptance ensures maximum total value for both parties

I think it's rational to accept this offer.
