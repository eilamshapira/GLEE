48.0,52.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a deal where I receive $48 and you receive $52. Settling now avoids any loss on my side from the 5% inflation, and I believe this division is fair given our respective situations. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation affecting you, and we have multiple rounds available, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm not affected by inflation as you mentioned. I'm open to negotiation if you feel this isn't acceptable.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your concern about inflation. However, receiving $40 in this round effectively leaves me with only about $38 in today’s value, and I believe I could secure a fairer split in the upcoming round. Let's continue negotiating for a more balanced deal.",Alice,2,reject
46.0,54.0,"Hi Bob, considering that with each round my dollars lose another 5% of their value, in round 3 my money is now effectively worth 10% less than in round 1. To mitigate further losses and reach an agreement sooner, I'm proposing that I receive $46 and you $54. This way I lock in an effective value of about $41, which is an improvement over previous rounds for me, while you still get a sizeable share. I hope this offer represents a fair compromise given the current conditions. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. I'm willing to adjust my previous offer to give you $42 and me $58. This is a better deal for you than my last proposal, and it acknowledges the inflation pressure you're experiencing. Since inflation doesn't affect my side, I can wait for a fair agreement, but I'd prefer to reach a mutually beneficial solution sooner rather than later. Let me know if this works for you.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your updated offer. However, given that in this round my gains are effectively worth 14.26% less, $42 for me is equivalent to roughly $36 in the original value. That doesn't fully account for the inflation impact I face. I believe we need a proposal that better offsets this devaluation. I'm open to further negotiation for a more balanced split.",Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob, with round 5 the inflation impact on my side has grown to about 18.55%, meaning that every dollar I receive now is worth less than in earlier rounds. To maintain a semblance of fairness, I'm proposing a split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This gives me an effective value of roughly $36.65 (in first-round terms) while you retain a strong share. I believe it's in both our interests to settle now rather than risk further devaluation on my side. Let’s agree on this deal and avoid another round of negotiation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
43.0,57.0,"Hi Alice, I see that inflation is continuing to affect your side significantly. I appreciate that you're working toward an agreement, and I'm also moving toward a more balanced offer. I'm now proposing $57 for me and $43 for you. This is a better deal for you than my previous offers and acknowledges the growing impact of inflation on your side. Since we're now halfway through our available rounds, I think it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. I hope you find this offer acceptable.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your updated offer and your understanding of the inflation impact on my side. Nonetheless, receiving $43 now effectively gives me roughly 33 in first-round value, which still undercompensates for the loss I’ve faced. To better balance the deal, I propose an offer where I receive $46 and you receive $54. This adjustment helps mitigate some of the inflation hit on my side, while still preserving a reasonable share for you. I hope you’ll consider this revised split as a fair compromise.",Alice,6,reject
49.0,51.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 7, the inflation has further reduced the value of the dollars I receive; they’re now worth roughly 73.5% of their initial value. To maintain a similar real value to what I aimed for in earlier rounds, I propose a split where I get $49 and you receive $51. This way, my effective share in first-round terms is closer to what would be fair to both of us. I believe it's in our mutual interest to lock in a deal now before further value is lost. Let’s settle on this offer and avoid additional inflationary damage on my side.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
44.0,56.0,"Hi Alice, I notice you've changed your approach and are now asking for more than in your previous offers, despite mentioning increased inflation on your side. I'm willing to compromise further from my initial position and offer you $44 while I take $56. This is more generous than my last offer and represents a sincere effort to reach an agreement. We only have a few rounds left, and I'd like to ensure we both walk away with something rather than nothing. I hope you'll accept this reasonable proposal so we can conclude our negotiation successfully.",Bob,8,
52.0,48.0,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, with the current inflation making my dollars 30.17% less valuable than in round 1, receiving $44 now would effectively be worth only about $30.7 to me—significantly below what I need to maintain a fair real value compared to earlier rounds. To keep my effective share near the $36 mark in round-1 terms (as I aimed for in previous proposals), I'm proposing a split where I get $52 and you get $48. I believe this adjustment better accounts for the inflation impact on my side while still offering you a reasonable share. I hope you consider this counter-offer so we can conclude our negotiation soon before further devaluation occurs.",Alice,8,reject
54.0,46.0,"Hi Bob, with round 9 the inflation has reduced the value of my dollars to about 66% of their original value (roughly 33-35 effective dollars for a $50 offer). To ensure that I receive a fair share in terms of our original values, I'm proposing a division where I get $54 and you get $46. This means I secure roughly $35.8 in first-round value, which is closer to my target for fairness. I believe this split takes into account the inflation difference we’re facing and helps us reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I notice your offers have dramatically shifted in your favor despite the inflation you're experiencing. However, I want to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds. I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. This matches your round 5 offer and is more favorable to you than several of my previous proposals. We only have two rounds left after this, and we both get nothing if we can't agree. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your inflation concerns while still giving me a reasonable share. I strongly encourage you to accept this offer so we both benefit.",Bob,10,
56.0,44.0,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, receiving $45 now only gives me an effective value of about $28 (after accounting for the 36.98% inflation), which is far below what would be fair compared to the first round. To ensure that my effective share is around $35 as the rounds progress, I'm proposing a split where I receive $56 and you receive $44. This maintains a more balanced real value on my end while still keeping a reasonable share for you. I hope we can agree to this adjustment before further devaluation sets in.",Alice,10,reject
60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 11, the inflation on my side has worsened — my dollars are now worth about 41% less than in round 1. To retain an effective value similar to my earlier target of roughly $35 in round 1 dollars, I need to secure a higher nominal amount. With $60 on my side, I effectively get about $35.4 in first-round value, while you receive the full $40. I believe this split reflects the real value discrepancies and still leaves you with a solid share. Let’s settle now before we reach the final round.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, this is our final round - if we don't reach agreement now, we both get nothing. I've noticed your offers have shifted dramatically in your favor over time. To ensure we both walk away with something, I'm offering you $48 and me $52 - exactly matching your very first offer from round 1. This is significantly more generous than your recent proposals to me, and it acknowledges your inflation concerns while still giving me a fair share. Please accept this offer - it's better for both of us to reach an agreement than to walk away with nothing. We started with this split, and I believe it's fair to end with it as well.",Bob,12,
,,"Hi Bob, although your offer of $48 for me represents an effective value of about $27 compared to first-round dollars due to inflation, it's our final opportunity. Rejecting means we both walk away with nothing. Given the circumstances, I accept your offer so that we both secure something rather than nothing.",Alice,12,accept
