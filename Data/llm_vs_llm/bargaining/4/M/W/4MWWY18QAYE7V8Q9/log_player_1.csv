Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation affecting you, and we have multiple rounds available, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm not affected by inflation as you mentioned. I'm open to negotiation if you feel this isn't acceptable.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your concern about inflation. However, receiving $40 in this round effectively leaves me with only about $38 in today’s value, and I believe I could secure a fairer split in the upcoming round.

This way I lock in an effective value of about $41, which is an improvement over previous rounds for me, while you still get a sizeable share. I hope this offer represents a fair compromise given the current conditions. Looking forward to your response.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. I'm willing to adjust my previous offer to give you $42 and me $58. This is a better deal for you than my last proposal, and it acknowledges the inflation pressure you're experiencing. Since inflation doesn't affect my side, I can wait for a fair agreement, but I'd prefer to reach a mutually beneficial solution sooner rather than later. Let me know if this works for you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your updated offer. However, given that in this round my gains are effectively worth 14.26% less, $42 for me is equivalent to roughly $36 in the original value.

I believe it's in both our interests to settle now rather than risk further devaluation on my side. Let’s agree on this deal and avoid another round of negotiation.""}"

Round 6

I appreciate that you're working toward an agreement, and I'm also moving toward a more balanced offer. I'm now proposing $57 for me and $43 for you. This is a better deal for you than my previous offers and acknowledges the growing impact of inflation on your side.

This way, my effective share in first-round terms is closer to what would be fair to both of us. I believe it's in our mutual interest to lock in a deal now before further value is lost.

To keep my effective share near the $36 mark in round-1 terms (as I aimed for in previous proposals), I'm proposing a split where I get $52 and you get $48. I believe this adjustment better accounts for the inflation impact on my side while still offering you a reasonable share.
