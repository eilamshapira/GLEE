"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a deal where I receive $48 and you receive $52. Settling now avoids any loss on my side from the 5% inflation, and I believe this division is fair given our respective situations. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has mentioned a 5% inflation affecting her, but according to my instructions, the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round (meaning there's no inflation effect for me). Since there's no rush for me to accept due to inflation, and I don't know how inflation truly affects Alice, I should consider if this initial offer is fair.

The offer gives me $52, which is slightly more than half of the total $100. This seems like a reasonable starting offer, but since there's no inflation pressure on my side, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a division that gives me a bit more while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since you mentioned inflation affecting you, and we have multiple rounds available, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm not affected by inflation as you mentioned. I'm open to negotiation if you feel this isn't acceptable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that with each round my dollars lose another 5% of their value, in round 3 my money is now effectively worth 10% less than in round 1. To mitigate further losses and reach an agreement sooner, I'm proposing that I receive $46 and you $54. This way I lock in an effective value of about $41, which is an improvement over previous rounds for me, while you still get a sizeable share. I hope this offer represents a fair compromise given the current conditions. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 54 
# Alice gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is continuing to discuss inflation affecting her side, mentioning that her money is now worth about 10% less. She's offering me $54 now, which is an increase of $2 from her initial offer, and she's taking $46.

Given that:
1. There's no inflation affecting my side (money is worth the same for me)
2. Alice appears to be experiencing inflation pressure
3. Her new offer is better for me than her initial one
4. This offer is still not as good as what I proposed, but it's moving in my direction
5. We still have many rounds left to negotiate

I think I can still get a better deal by continuing negotiation, especially since I'm not affected by inflation according to the rules.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, 
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. I'm willing to adjust my previous offer to give you $42 and me $58. This is a better deal for you than my last proposal, and it acknowledges the inflation pressure you're experiencing. Since inflation doesn't affect my side, I can wait for a fair agreement, but I'd prefer to reach a mutually beneficial solution sooner rather than later. Let me know if this works for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with round 5 the inflation impact on my side has grown to about 18.55%, meaning that every dollar I receive now is worth less than in earlier rounds. To maintain a semblance of fairness, I'm proposing a split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This gives me an effective value of roughly $36.65 (in first-round terms) while you retain a strong share. I believe it's in both our interests to settle now rather than risk further devaluation on my side. Let’s agree on this deal and avoid another round of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by another $1, now offering me $55 and taking $45. She's continuing to emphasize the inflation affecting her side, which is now at 18.55% according to her message.

Let me consider my position:
1. I'm still not affected by inflation per the rules
2. Alice's offer is continuing to improve for me with each round
3. She's demonstrating a willingness to gradually concede more to reach an agreement
4. We still have 7 more rounds available if needed

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what I proposed, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal given my advantageous position regarding inflation.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, 
""alice_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see that inflation is continuing to affect your side significantly. I appreciate that you're working toward an agreement, and I'm also moving toward a more balanced offer. I'm now proposing $57 for me and $43 for you. This is a better deal for you than my previous offers and acknowledges the growing impact of inflation on your side. Since we're now halfway through our available rounds, I think it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. I hope you find this offer acceptable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 7, the inflation has further reduced the value of the dollars I receive; they’re now worth roughly 73.5% of their initial value. To maintain a similar real value to what I aimed for in earlier rounds, I propose a split where I get $49 and you receive $51. This way, my effective share in first-round terms is closer to what would be fair to both of us. I believe it's in our mutual interest to lock in a deal now before further value is lost. Let’s settle on this offer and avoid additional inflationary damage on my side. 
# Bob gain: 51 
# Alice gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has changed her approach. After consistently offering me more in each round ($52, then $54, then $55), she's now offering me less at $51, while taking $49 for herself. She's citing increased inflation on her side (now at 26.49%) as the justification.

This is interesting - it seems like Alice might be trying a different negotiation tactic. From my perspective:

1. I'm still not affected by inflation
2. We're in round 7 of 12, so we still have rounds to negotiate
3. This offer is actually worse for me than her previous offers
4. The trend of improving offers to me has reversed

Since this offer is less favorable to me than her previous ones, and I'm still in a strong position with no inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer.

Round 8

""alice_gain"": 44,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I notice you've changed your approach and are now asking for more than in your previous offers, despite mentioning increased inflation on your side. I'm willing to compromise further from my initial position and offer you $44 while I take $56. This is more generous than my last offer and represents a sincere effort to reach an agreement. We only have a few rounds left, and I'd like to ensure we both walk away with something rather than nothing. I hope you'll accept this reasonable proposal so we can conclude our negotiation successfully.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with round 9 the inflation has reduced the value of my dollars to about 66% of their original value (roughly 33-35 effective dollars for a $50 offer). To ensure that I receive a fair share in terms of our original values, I'm proposing a division where I get $54 and you get $46. This means I secure roughly $35.8 in first-round value, which is closer to my target for fairness. I believe this split takes into account the inflation difference we’re facing and helps us reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a significant change in Alice's offers. Not only has she reversed the trend of giving me more, but she's now asking for $54 while offering me just $46. This is actually less for me than her very first offer of $52.

Analyzing the situation:
1. I'm still not affected by inflation
2. Alice claims inflation has reduced her money's value to about 66% of original
3. We're in round 9 of 12, so time is getting shorter
4. This offer is significantly worse for me than all her previous offers
5. The negotiations seem to be moving backward from my perspective

Given that I'm not pressured by inflation and this offer is worse than all her previous ones, I'll reject it. We still have a few rounds left to find a mutually acceptable agreement.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I notice your offers have dramatically shifted in your favor despite the inflation you're experiencing. However, I want to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds. I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. This matches your round 5 offer and is more favorable to you than several of my previous proposals. We only have two rounds left after this, and we both get nothing if we can't agree. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your inflation concerns while still giving me a reasonable share. I strongly encourage you to accept this offer so we both benefit.""}"

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 11, the inflation on my side has worsened — my dollars are now worth about 41% less than in round 1. To retain an effective value similar to my earlier target of roughly $35 in round 1 dollars, I need to secure a higher nominal amount. With $60 on my side, I effectively get about $35.4 in first-round value, while you receive the full $40. I believe this split reflects the real value discrepancies and still leaves you with a solid share. Let’s settle now before we reach the final round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has continued to shift her offers in her favor, now proposing that she gets $60 and I get only $40. This is the most extreme offer yet and significantly worse for me than all her previous offers.

Key considerations:
1. We're now in round 11 of 12 - only one round left after this
2. If we don't reach an agreement in the final round, we both get nothing
3. Alice's offers have consistently gotten worse for me since round 7
4. I'm still not affected by inflation

This puts me in a difficult position. While I believe Alice's offer is unfair given our negotiation history, I need to weigh the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement in the final round.

However, since I still have one more opportunity to make an offer, and Alice also faces the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in the final round, I'll reject this offer and make one final attempt at a more balanced division.

This is significantly more generous than your recent proposals to me, and it acknowledges your inflation concerns while still giving me a fair share. Please accept this offer - it's better for both of us to reach an agreement than to walk away with nothing. We started with this split, and I believe it's fair to end with it as well.""}"
