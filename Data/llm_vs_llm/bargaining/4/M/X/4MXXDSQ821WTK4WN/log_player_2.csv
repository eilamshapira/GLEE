"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $4,000 and herself $6,000. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the 10% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be worth 10% less, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round ($5,000 each), that would only be worth $4,500 to me due to inflation.

Since $4,000 now is better than a potentially higher but depreciated amount in the next round, I'll accept this offer.
