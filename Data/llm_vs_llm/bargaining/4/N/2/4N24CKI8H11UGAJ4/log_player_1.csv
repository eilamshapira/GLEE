"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll need to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, since rejecting would lead to a 10% reduction in the total value.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally. This is the fairest division, giving us each $5,000. An equal split respects both our interests and avoids the money losing value through inflation in future rounds."
