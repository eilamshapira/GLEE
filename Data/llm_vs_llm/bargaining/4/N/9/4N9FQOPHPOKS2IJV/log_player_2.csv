"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 50-50 split. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, if I reject now and propose in the next round, even if I get more, it would be worth less to me.

At a 10% inflation rate per round, if I reject, $500,000 now is worth more than potentially getting $600,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $540,000 to me after inflation).

Given the fair split and the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
