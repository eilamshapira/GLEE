"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair and whether I can potentially get a better deal in the next round. 

The offer is an even 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I have an advantage: if we go to the next round, the money will be worth the same to me (0% inflation for me), but will be worth 5% less to Alice. This gives me some leverage.

If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice might be more willing to accept a slightly lower amount since her future money would be worth less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we've moved to round 2, I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less to Alice in this round, she should be willing to accept slightly less than an even split to avoid further depreciation of value.

I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor, but not so aggressive that Alice would definitely reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering myself $55 and Alice $45. This is reasonable because if Alice rejects this offer, in the next round the $100 will be worth only $95 to her (due to her 5% inflation), so she has incentive to accept a deal now rather than potentially getting even less later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the game dynamics.

Alice has offered me $58 while taking $42. This is better for me than my previous offer of $55/$45. Since there's no inflation for me, this $58 is worth the full amount. 

If I reject and we go to round 4, I could potentially make a more aggressive offer. However, Alice has already moved significantly from her initial 50/50 split to 58/42 in my favor, acknowledging the inflation pressure she faces.

Given that:
- I've already improved from the initial 50/50 offer
- Alice has offered me more than I proposed in round 2
- There's risk in continuing to negotiate
- The offer is quite favorable to me
