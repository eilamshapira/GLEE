"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether I should accept this even split or try to negotiate for a better deal, recognizing that inflation will reduce the value of my money in future rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, my money would be worth 20% less. So even if I could get more dollars in round 2, I need to weigh that against the decreased value.

An even 50-50 split in round 1 means I get the full value of $50. If I were to get $60 in round 2, it would only be worth $48 to me after inflation (60 Ã— 0.8), which is worse than accepting $50 now.

This is a fair initial offer that protects me from inflation losses, and there's risk in rejecting it.
