"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for us to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But my money will be worth 20% less
   - $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after inflation)

While a 50/50 split might seem more fair, considering the inflation penalty, accepting $40 now is actually a reasonable deal. If I reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation will eat into my gains.
