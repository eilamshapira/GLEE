475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the impact of inflation on my share, I’m proposing we settle now. I offer you $525000 and I keep $475000. Accepting this deal promptly secures a substantial amount for both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be realistic, I'm offering you 400000, take it or leave it.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer. However, given the transmission of inflation—and that in round 3 I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division under conditions more favorable to me—I believe it’s in my best interest to pass on your current proposal. I look forward to the next round to craft a mutually acceptable division.",Alice,2,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Hi Bob, considering the effects of inflation on both our shares—with my side now 10% discounted compared to the initial round and uncertainty about further devaluations for you—I propose we settle now. I offer $430000 for me and $570000 for you. Locking in this deal means you avoid the risk of further value erosion and ensure a solid portion for yourself. I believe this is a fair adjustment from our earlier rounds. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want this settled.  Let's cut to the chase - 650000 for me, 350000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation we both face.  Don't let greed make us both lose out.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to settle quickly, but the devaluation on my side makes 350000 nominal far less attractive than I'd hoped. I believe we can come to a better agreement if we continue negotiating. I'm looking forward to making my proposal in round 5—one that benefits us both even under these inflation pressures.",Alice,4,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 5, the continuing inflation further diminishes our pot—the value I receive is now roughly 18% less than in round 1, and your share is down even more steeply. To prevent additional losses for both of us and to lock in something now, I propose a division of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. I believe this strike a fair balance given our respective devaluation rates. Let's settle now rather than risk further erosion in value. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Alice, time is running out.  My offer is 620000 for me and 380000 for you. This is a compromise, and realistically, it's the best you'll get at this point. Let's be smart and take this deal before inflation eats away even more.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate that you're eager to settle, but I must decline your current offer. With my share now depreciated by 22.62% relative to round 1, receiving 380000 leaves me with a significantly reduced effective amount. I believe that if we continue the negotiations, we still have an opportunity to secure a more balanced and mutually beneficial split before further inflation takes its toll. Let's keep working toward a deal that better reflects our current economic realities.",Alice,6,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Bob, as we step into round 7, the inflation bite is deepening—my share is now roughly 26% lower than in round 1, while yours suffers even more. To lock in better value before further erosion, I’m proposing 420000 for me and 580000 for you. This deal still gives you a higher nominal amount while preventing further losses from inflation on both sides. I believe it’s a fair compromise to secure our interests now. What do you say?",Alice,7,
