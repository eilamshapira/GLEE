# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. However, given the transmission of inflation—and that in round 3 I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division under conditions more favorable to me—I believe it’s in my best interest to pass on your current proposal. I look forward to the next round to craft a mutually acceptable division.""}"

I offer $430,000 for me and $570,000 for you. Locking in this deal means you avoid the risk of further value erosion and ensure a solid portion for yourself. I believe this is a fair adjustment from our earlier rounds. What do you say?""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want this settled.  Let's cut to the chase - 650000 for me, 350000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation we both face.  Don't let greed make us both lose out.

To prevent additional losses for both of us and to lock in something now, I propose a division of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out.  My offer is 620000 for me and 380000 for you. This is a compromise, and realistically, it's the best you'll get at this point. Let's be smart and take this deal before inflation eats away even more.

With my share now depreciated by 22.62% relative to round 1, receiving 380,000 leaves me with a significantly reduced effective amount. I believe that if we continue the negotiations, we still have an opportunity to secure a more balanced and mutually beneficial split before further inflation takes its toll.

To lock in better value before further erosion, I’m proposing 420,000 for me and 580,000 for you.
