"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the impact of inflation on my share, I’m proposing we settle now. I offer you $525000 and I keep $475000. Accepting this deal promptly secures a substantial amount for both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 475000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the effects of inflation on both our shares—with my side now 10% discounted compared to the initial round and uncertainty about further devaluations for you—I propose we settle now. I offer $430000 for me and $570000 for you. Locking in this deal means you avoid the risk of further value erosion and ensure a solid portion for yourself. I believe this is a fair adjustment from our earlier rounds. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 570000 
# Alice gain: 430000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to downplay the inflation impact on her end and exaggerate it on mine. While I don't know her exact devaluation rate, accepting a deal where I continuously get a smaller share is not in my best interest. I need to push for a more favorable split before the devaluation significantly eats into my potential gain."

Let's cut to the chase - 650,000 for me, 350,000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation we both face.  Don't let greed make us both lose out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 5, the continuing inflation further diminishes our pot—the value I receive is now roughly 18% less than in round 1, and your share is down even more steeply. To prevent additional losses for both of us and to lock in something now, I propose a division of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. I believe this strike a fair balance given our respective devaluation rates. Let's settle now rather than risk further erosion in value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is still trying to manipulate me with the devaluation narrative. While my share is indeed decreasing more rapidly, accepting 550,000 now when I was aiming for at least 600,000 initially is a significant loss.  The closer we get to the deadline, the more desperate Alice will become. Holding out a bit longer is risky, but the potential payoff is worth it."

My offer is 620,000 for me and 380,000 for you. This is a compromise, and realistically, it's the best you'll get at this point. Let's be smart and take this deal before inflation eats away even more.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we step into round 7, the inflation bite is deepening—my share is now roughly 26% lower than in round 1, while yours suffers even more. To lock in better value before further erosion, I’m proposing 420000 for me and 580000 for you. This deal still gives you a higher nominal amount while preventing further losses from inflation on both sides. I believe it’s a fair compromise to secure our interests now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The devaluation is hitting hard, and my position is weakening. While 580,000 is less than I initially wanted, it's still better than any offer Alice has made so far.  Continuing to push my luck is too risky now, and I could end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon."
