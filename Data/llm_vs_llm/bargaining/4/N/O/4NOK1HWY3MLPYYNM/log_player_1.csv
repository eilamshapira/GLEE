"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $10,000, taking into account the 20% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since I'm facing inflation with each round, I'm offering slightly more to myself than to Bob, but still keeping the offer reasonably fair. This way, Bob should find it attractive enough to accept rather than moving to the next round where the total value would decrease for me due to inflation."
