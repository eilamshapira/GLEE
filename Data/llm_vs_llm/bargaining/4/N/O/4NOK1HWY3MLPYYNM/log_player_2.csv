"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the value will be 20% less for me.

My current offer is worth $4,500. If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round. This means even if I proposed a perfectly fair 50-50 split ($5,000 each) in the next round, it would only be worth $4,000 to me due to inflation.

Since $4,500 now is greater than what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round after inflation, accepting is the rational choice.
