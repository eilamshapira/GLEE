"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than the original proposal and still gives you a substantial amount of $450000. Since we both want to avoid dragging this out through many rounds, this seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we're now in round 3, and the value of the money is decreasing for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect on my share. Let's end this soon before the value drops further.""
