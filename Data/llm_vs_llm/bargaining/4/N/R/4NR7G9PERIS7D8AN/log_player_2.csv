"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which means I would get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, there are a few considerations:
1. She mentions inflation, though it doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me)
2. We have 12 rounds total if needed
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round

Given that inflation doesn't affect me, I have some negotiating power. I could reject and propose a more favorable split for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than the original proposal and still gives you a substantial amount of $450,000. Since we both want to avoid dragging this out through many rounds, this seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we're now in round 3, and the value of the money is decreasing for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect on my share. Let's end this soon before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this updated offer. Alice is now proposing a 55-45 split in her favor, where I would get $450,000 and she would get $550,000. She mentions that inflation is affecting her share (19% less value since round 1), while my share maintains its value.

This is an improvement from her initial 60-40 split offer. While it's still not as good as the 55-45 split in my favor that I proposed, the fact that inflation is affecting her but not me is a legitimate concern from her perspective.

Given that:
1. We're now in round 3, with 9 rounds remaining
2. Alice is experiencing inflation effects that I'm not
3. This is a reasonable compromise from her initial offer
