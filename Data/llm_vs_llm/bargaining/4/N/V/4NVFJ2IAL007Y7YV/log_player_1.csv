"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3571, ""bob_gain"": 6429, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation we should settle now. Considering that with each round my money loses 20% of its value while yours loses only 10%, the bargaining favors you if we delay. Based on a fair equilibrium in our alternating-offers game, I propose that I receive $3,571 and you receive $6,429. I believe this division reflects our differing discount factors and is fair if we want to secure value immediately. Let me know what you think.""}"
