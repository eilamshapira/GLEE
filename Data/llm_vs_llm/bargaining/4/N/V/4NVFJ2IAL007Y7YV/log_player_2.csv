"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation we should settle now. Considering that with each round my money loses 20% of its value while yours loses only 10%, the bargaining favors you if we delay. Based on a fair equilibrium in our alternating-offers game, I propose that I receive $3571 and you receive $6429. I believe this division reflects our differing discount factors and is fair if we want to secure value immediately. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 6429 
# Alice gain: 3571 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
