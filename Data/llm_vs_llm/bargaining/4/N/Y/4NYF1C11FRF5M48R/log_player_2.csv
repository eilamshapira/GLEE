"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. If I reject and we move to the next round, the total value to me decreases by 5% due to inflation, but I get to make the next offer.

Let me consider this: With 5% inflation, the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split then, but Alice could also reject and we'd continue the game with further value loss for me.

Given this is the first round and Alice's offer gives me a substantial portion (45%) of the total, I'll accept it rather than risk further value erosion.
