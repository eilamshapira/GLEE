"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you weren't happy with my offer. How about this? It's still a good deal for you, and I need to eat too! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is worth approximately $3240 (4000 * 0.81, since it's 19% less valuable). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the value of the money for me has decreased by 19% in round 2 and another 10% in round 3, making it a total of 29% less valuable (0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729). For simplicity, I'll calculate the value as approximately 71.9% of the original (1 - 0.29 = 0.719 or 71.9%) of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer.
