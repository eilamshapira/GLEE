"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will make the first offer.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and make a decision.

*   **My perspective:** The value of the money I receive is reduced by 20% each round.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The value of his money is reduced by 10% each round.

Since this is round 2, my $1 is now worth only $0.80 in round 1 terms.

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets $4000
*   Bob gets $6000

I will calculate what $4000 is worth to me in terms of its original value in round 1.

My $4000 in round 2 is equivalent to $4000 / 0.80 = $5000 in round 1 terms.

Given that this round I am losing more than what I would in a potential next round, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
