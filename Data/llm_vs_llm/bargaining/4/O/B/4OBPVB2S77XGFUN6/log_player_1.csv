"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This seems most equitable for both of us. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value of my share by 20%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I can try to negotiate a better deal. However, a 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, considering the circumstances.
