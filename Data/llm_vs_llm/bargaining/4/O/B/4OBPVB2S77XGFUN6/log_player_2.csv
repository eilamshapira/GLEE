"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. That's not an even split.

I should factor in the 20% inflation penalty I face with each round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, but we go multiple rounds, my potential gain decreases significantly.

However, as this is only round 1 of 12, I think I can propose a fairer division in the next round. The inflation only applies once at this stage, so I still have room to negotiate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more even split while acknowledging the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This seems most equitable for both of us. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value of my share by 20%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
