"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob might accept it, avoiding the inflation penalties for both of us. It's better to reach an agreement quickly since we both lose value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4,500 at 90% value = $4,050 effective value
   * Bob gets $5,500 at 95% value = $5,225 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Any amount I get will be worth only 80% of original value
   * Any amount Bob gets will be worth 90% of original value
   * This significant reduction makes accepting now more attractive

Since the effective value I'd get in the next round would be even lower due to the 10% inflation penalty, and this offer isn't too unfair, I should accept it.
