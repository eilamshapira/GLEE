"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 and keeping $5,500
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - The money will be worth 10% less to Alice
3. $4,500 now vs. potential for more in next round, but at 5% less value

Since I can make a counter-offer next round when Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her (making her more likely to accept a lower amount), and the 5% loss for me is relatively small, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice has shown she wants a larger share
2. But now the money is worth 10% less to her, so she'll be more willing to accept less
3. I want to be fair but also maximize my gain
4. Total value is still $10,000, but worth less to both of us

I'll propose a slightly more balanced split, but in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
- It's a reasonable reversal of her initial offer
- Given the 10% depreciation for her, she has more incentive to accept now rather than wait
- It's not so extreme that she's likely to reject it outright"
