"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get 1,000$ and she gets 9,000$ out of the 10,000$ total. This is a 10-90 split which seems quite unfavorable to me.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (so the 10,000$ will effectively be worth 9,500$ to me). However, I could propose a much more favorable split.

Since this first offer is significantly unbalanced in Alice's favor, and I can make a counter-offer that would likely net me more than 1,000$ even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that the value of the money has already decreased 5% for me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000. This gives us both an equal share of $5,000. Given that inflation affects my value of the money, a fair split is reasonable and should be attractive to Alice. If she rejects this offer, she'll face the same inflation penalty in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new information carefully.

Important new information: The inflation affects me (Bob) differently than Alice. I've now learned that Alice doesn't experience any inflation penalty, while my inflation penalty is cumulative (now at 9.75%).

Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000. Considering the inflation effect, $4,000 is now worth about $3,610 to me (after 9.75% reduction).

If I reject and we go to another round:
- My inflation penalty will increase further
- I could offer a better split, but Alice has no inflation pressure and can afford to wait
- The fact that Alice has no inflation penalty puts her in a stronger negotiating position

Since Alice has a significant advantage with no inflation penalty, and her offer of $4,000 is reasonably fair considering our relative positions:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
