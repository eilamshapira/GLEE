"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4000 (40%) while keeping $6000 (60%)
- This is less than half, but still a substantial amount
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, each round that passes increases risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
- Since it's early (round 1), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair offer to Alice:
- I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor
- A 55-45 split seems reasonable and more likely to be accepted
- It's important not to be too greedy as we need to reach agreement within 12 rounds

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split as it's closer to an equal division while still giving me a slight advantage. This offer should appear fair enough to Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new situation:
1. The inflation information is crucial - Alice's gains are worth 36% less now
2. Alice's offered $5500 is actually worth only $3520 to her (after 36% reduction)
3. My $4500 maintains its full value
4. Alice seems to be moving towards a more equal split from her initial 60-40 offer
5. However, given the inflation impact on her side, I can probably negotiate for an even better deal
6. We still have 9 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I believe I can get a better deal, considering the inflation's impact on Alice's side makes her more likely to accept a higher amount for me in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the situation:
1. Alice is experiencing 36% inflation on her gains
2. She's shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offers
3. I should propose a deal that looks appealing given her inflation situation
4. Need to balance between getting a good deal and reaching agreement (8 rounds left)
5. Since her money is worth less, she'll need a larger nominal amount to get fair value

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
- With 36% inflation, Alice's $4000 is worth about $2560 to her
- This gives me a good deal while still leaving Alice with a meaningful amount
- It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair from the nominal amounts
- We need to move towards agreement to avoid both getting nothing"
