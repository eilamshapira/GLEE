"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

I think a more equitable split would be appropriate. Given that Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round while I don't, this offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Alice is fair. It's close to an even split while acknowledging that Alice has some incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I notice that Alice is gradually increasing my share as the rounds progress, recognizing the inflation pressure. Since Alice is now facing a 27.1% cumulative inflation effect (money worth 72.9% of the original value), I'm proposing $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Alice. This split acknowledges Alice's declining bargaining position due to inflation while still leaving her with a substantial portion."
