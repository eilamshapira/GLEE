"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be 5% less for me due to inflation (worth only 95$ to me).

If I accept now, I get 50$ clean. If I reject and propose something like 60-40 in my favor next round, that would be 60$ of a 95$ value (to me), which is 57$. But Alice might reject that counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further delays, the 50-50 split is reasonable.
