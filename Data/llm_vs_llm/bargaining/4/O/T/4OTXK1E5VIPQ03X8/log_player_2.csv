"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me (so $90 total). While 40% of $100 ($40) is less than what I could potentially get by making a counter-offer, the risk of further negotiations and value decay makes this a reasonable opening offer.

Additionally, accepting now secures a definite amount rather than risking further rounds where the money becomes worth less to me through inflation.
