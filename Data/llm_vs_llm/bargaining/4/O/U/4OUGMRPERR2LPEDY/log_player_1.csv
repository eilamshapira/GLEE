"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since my money is worth less each round, I need a bigger share. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

Original value: $4000
Inflation reduction: 5% of $4000 = $200
Actual value: $4000 - $200 = $3800

Bob's offer gives me $3800, which is less than what I initially offered myself. However, I need to consider the decreasing value of the money in subsequent rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth:

For me (Alice): 5% less in Round 1, and another 5% less in Round 2, so the total reduction is 10% (1 - 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.0975, but for simplicity, we'll use 10% as the reduction over two rounds, which is approximately 1 - 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.0975).
For Bob: 20% less in Round 1, and another 20% less in Round 2, so the total reduction is 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36).

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, considering the inflation, this is a fair split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My money is depreciating faster. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth:

For me (Alice): 14.26% less than the original value (1 - 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.1426, approximately, over three rounds).
For Bob: 48.8% less than the original value (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.488, approximately, over three rounds).

Bob's offer gives me $3000, but due to the 14.26% inflation reduction, the actual value is:
$3000 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = $2572.20

This is a relatively low offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

For me (Alice): 14.26% less than the original value (as calculated before).
For Bob: 48.8% less than the original value (as calculated before).

I'll make a more generous offer to Bob, considering his money is depreciating faster.

""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last offer. My money is rapidly losing value. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth:

For me (Alice): 22.62% less than the original value (1 - 0.95^5 = 0.2262, approximately, over five rounds).
For Bob: 67.23% less than the original value (1 - 0.8^5 = 0.6723, approximately, over five rounds).

Bob's offer gives me $2500, but due to the 22.62% inflation reduction, the actual value is:
$2500 * 0.7738 (1 - 0.2262) = $1934.50

This is a very low offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. However, I also need to consider that Bob's money is rapidly losing value, and he might be willing to accept a lower amount in the next round.

Given the significant depreciation of Bob's money, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

For me (Alice): 22.62% less than the original value (as calculated before).

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the best I can do at this point.  Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

For Bob: 79.03% less than the original value (1 - 0.8^7 = 0.7903, approximately, over seven rounds).

Bob's offer gives me $2000, but due to the 30.17% inflation reduction, the actual value is:
$2000 * 0.6983 (1 - 0.3017) = $1396.60

This is a very low offer, but I also need to consider that we are running out of rounds, and if we don't reach an agreement, we'll both get nothing. Additionally, Bob's money is almost worthless at this point, so he might be desperate to get something.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept this offer, as it's better than getting nothing.
