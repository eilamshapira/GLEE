"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next offer

While $400,000 is less than half, waiting has significant costs due to inflation. If I reject, any amount I get in the next round will be worth 20% less to me. Plus, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more value loss.

A quick calculation: If I reject, my $400,000 would be worth $320,000 in the next round. That's a significant loss just to try to negotiate for more.
