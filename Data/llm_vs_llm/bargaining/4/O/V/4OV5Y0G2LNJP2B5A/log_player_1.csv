"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll be strategic here. Given that the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, it makes sense to make a reasonable offer that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a substantial portion while still giving me the majority. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty than I do, he has more incentive to accept an early offer rather than continuing to the next round."
