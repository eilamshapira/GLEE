"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total.

If I reject this offer, I get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's 20% inflation for me, meaning the total value to me would be $8,000 instead of $10,000. For Alice, the inflation is only 10%, so the total value to her would be $9,000.

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the most I could get in the next round is $8,000 (if Alice accepts my offer of everything for me, which is unlikely). Even a 50-50 split would give me $4,000 of the inflation-adjusted $8,000, which is the same as what I'm being offered now.

Considering that Alice may reject my counter-offer and the money would be worth even less in subsequent rounds, I should accept this offer.
