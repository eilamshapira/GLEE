"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also playing to win. Take this or risk getting less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $100,000 for me, $900,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- My money will be worth 20% less
- Her money will be worth 5% less
- Maximum I could offer myself would be worth 80% of current value

3. Analysis:
- $100,000 now is better than $800,000 in the next round
- Alice's offer is quite low (only 10% of total)
- I can make a better counter-offer next round and she might accept due to her lower inflation rate

4. Decision:
This offer is too low. I should reject and make a counter-offer where I get a larger share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Considerations:
- From my perspective, the money is worth 80% of original value
- For Alice, it's worth 95% of original value
- Need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept
- But also need to get a better deal than previous offer

2. Strategy:
- Propose a more balanced split
- Emphasize mutual benefit and loss from further delays
- Account for different inflation rates

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. If you reject, your next offer will be worth less to both of us. Let's make a deal now.""}"
