6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $4000 share. This is reasonable considering the inflation penalties we both face if we delay - I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. A quick agreement benefits us both, especially since my penalty is greater than yours.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I understand the pressure of the inflation penalty, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of our relative losses as the game progresses.  What do you say?",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but let's find a middle ground. I'm now offering you $4500, which is more generous considering my 20% inflation penalty versus your 10%. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 36% of my initial value while you only lose 19%. This 55/45 split is fair given our asymmetric inflation risks.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we need to settle this now. I'm feeling the impact of inflation, and I'm sure you are too. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This is my final offer; let's avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
