"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation penalty for both of us if we extend negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $4,000 share. This is reasonable considering the inflation penalties we both face if we delay - I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. A quick agreement benefits us both, especially since my penalty is greater than yours.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I understand the pressure of the inflation penalty, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of our relative losses as the game progresses.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but let's find a middle ground. I'm now offering you $4,500, which is more generous considering my 20% inflation penalty versus your 10%. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 36% of my initial value while you only lose 19%. This 55/45 split is fair given our asymmetric inflation risks.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. I'm feeling the impact of inflation, and I'm sure you are too. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This is my final offer; let's avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
