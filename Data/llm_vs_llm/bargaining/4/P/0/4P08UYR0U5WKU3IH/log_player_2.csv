"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $4000 share. This is reasonable considering the inflation penalties we both face if we delay - I lose 20% each round while you lose 10%. A quick agreement benefits us both, especially since my penalty is greater than yours. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I understand the pressure of the inflation penalty, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of our relative losses as the game progresses.  What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but let's find a middle ground. I'm now offering you $4500, which is more generous considering my 20% inflation penalty versus your 10%. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 36% of my initial value while you only lose 19%. This 55/45 split is fair given our asymmetric inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now. I'm feeling the impact of inflation, and I'm sure you are too. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This is my final offer; let's avoid further losses.""}"
