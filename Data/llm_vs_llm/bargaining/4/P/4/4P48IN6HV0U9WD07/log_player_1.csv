"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a significant portion (40%) to encourage acceptance early on. Inflation will hurt me with each round, so I want to secure a decent amount now. I believe this offer is generous enough to be accepted, considering the unknown effect of inflation on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning: Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to agree to receive nothing, especially considering the inflation I'm already facing. This is clearly a bargaining tactic, and I won't fall for it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is eating into my potential gains, so I need to be more strategic. In round 2 the money for Alice is worth 90.25% of the initial amount and for Bob 81% of the initial amount.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Reasoning:

*   I've reduced my share slightly from the initial offer, hoping Bob will see this as a sign of compromise.
*   I'm still aiming for a majority share to compensate for the rapidly increasing impact of inflation on my gains.
*   The hope is that Bob will accept this, given that he's also experiencing inflation (though at a different rate) and we're getting closer to the deadline. If Bob's gain is higher it's in his interest to close the deal faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning:

Although I am losing 14.26% of the initial value of the money, Bob is losing 27.1% of it. Accepting 6500$ is better than risking a loss in later rounds."
