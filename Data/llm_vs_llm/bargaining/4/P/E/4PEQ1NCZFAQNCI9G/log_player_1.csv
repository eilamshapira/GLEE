"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we adjust to a 45/55 split? I think it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $550,000, but it's worth 5% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500.

Since Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation, I'll accept his offer.
