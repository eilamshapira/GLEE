"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me a substantial amount, it's less than half the total. Given that the inflation rates affect Alice more than me, I have an advantage in later rounds. However, I should consider that every round means both of us lose value.

Let me calculate: If I reject, we go to round 2, and my offer would be subject to 5% inflation for me and 20% inflation for Alice. So waiting a round is more costly for Alice, which gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that acknowledges both our inflation rates and the fact that Alice made the first offer. Since Alice loses more value each round (20% vs my 5%), I'll offer a fair split that's slightly in my favor but still attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest this fair division that gives me a majority share while still providing Alice with a substantial portion. Given our different inflation rates, this is a reasonable offer that allows us both to maximize our gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the current offer and future inflation effects. 

Alice has improved her offer, now giving me 480,000 compared to the initial 400,000. If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where my money would be worth 14.26% less than the initial value (another 5% decrease), and Alice's would be worth 48.8% less (another 20% decrease).

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward a more balanced split, and considering the accelerating effects of inflation on both our shares, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
