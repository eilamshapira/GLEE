"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a fair division where I get a bit more to account for the inflation risk I face. With each round, the money is worth 5% less to me, so an early agreement is in both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob while still accounting for the inflation I face. With a 5% inflation penalty each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair division considering our different positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
