"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing to split the $100 by taking $55 and giving you $45. Given that delaying the agreement only risks the value of the money (inflation effects on my side, and possibly on yours too), I think it’s best to lock in a deal now. I believe this is a fair starting offer, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts if you’d like to negotiate further.""}"
