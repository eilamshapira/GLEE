"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'll make my first offer. Considering inflation, I need to secure a good amount for myself.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'll analyze the situation. My original offer was rejected, and now I have a reduced amount due to inflation. 

In the first round, my gain was equivalent to 6000$. In this round the money is worth 10% less, so the equivalent value for me is 0.9 * 4500$ = 4050$.

So I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, it's my turn to make an offer in round 3.  The inflation is really starting to bite. The original 10,000$ is now worth less to me. I'll need to be more aggressive to compensate.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate. The money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

In round 1, my gain was equivalent to 6000$. Now, to calculate the equivalent value, we multiply: 6000 * (1 - 0.271) = 4374$.
In this round, Bob is offering 4200$. This is slightly less than the equivalent value of the first round.

So I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 5. The inflation is really impacting the value of the money. I need to make an offer that reflects the reduced value and tries to secure a decent amount for myself. I'll try a slightly more generous offer than before, but still aiming for a good share.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 6, considering inflation.

The money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, where my gain was worth 6000$.

Therefore, the current equivalent value for Alice is: 6000 * (1 - 0.4095) = 3543$.

Bob is offering Alice 4000$, which is a little bit more than the equivalent of my first round offer.

I will **accept** this offer.
