8000.0,2000.0,I'm offering you 20% of the initial amount. Take it or we get less later!,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than me (10% per round), this is actually in your favor to accept now. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for you.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Look, you're losing value faster than me. I'm offering you 40% this time. It's still a decent amount, and we both get to walk away with something. Inflation will continue to hurt you more if we delay further.",Alice,3,
