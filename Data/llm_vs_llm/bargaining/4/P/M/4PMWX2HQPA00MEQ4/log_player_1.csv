"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than me (10% per round), this is actually in your favor to accept now. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
