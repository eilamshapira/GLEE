"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you 20% of the initial amount. Take it or we get less later! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me only 20% of the total, which is quite unfair. Given that inflation affects me less than Alice (10% vs 20% per round), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you more (20% per round) than me (10% per round), this is actually in your favor to accept now. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, you're losing value faster than me. I'm offering you 40% this time. It's still a decent amount, and we both get to walk away with something. Inflation will continue to hurt you more if we delay further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is incorrect about the inflation rates - I'm actually losing value slower (10% per round) than she is (20% per round). However, her offer of 40% ($4,000) is better than before and shows movement toward a more equitable split.

Given that I'm now in round 3 with 19% inflation on my share, $4,000 is worth about $3,240 to me now. If I reject and we go to round 4, even if I propose a 50-50 split, my $5,000 would be worth about $3,550 after my inflation rate. The difference isn't huge, and there's risk Alice would reject again.
