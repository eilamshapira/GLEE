5500.0,4500.0,"Let's split it fairly, but with a slight edge for me to account for future inflation impacting my share more. This ensures we both benefit significantly from this deal right away!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Since your share loses 10% value each round, it's in your interest to accept now. This is still a substantial amount for you, worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting me more each round. I need a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of my portion. Let's get this done!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. Your $4000 now is worth more than $6000 in a few rounds due to your inflation penalty. Each round we delay, your share loses 10% more value. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - you should take it now while the money holds more value for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation is killing me. I am giving you a significant portion. It is still worth more now than nothing if we run out of rounds.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, your strategy of offering me less isn't working - your money is now worth only 65.61% of its original value. Even this $3000 now is worth more than $6500 would be in a few more rounds. If we continue, your share will be worth less than half its original value. This is your best opportunity to walk away with meaningful value. Let's finish this now.",Bob,6,
