# Bob's message: Since your share loses 10% value each round, it's in your interest to accept now. This is still a substantial amount for you, worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. Your $4000 now is worth more than $6000 in a few rounds due to your inflation penalty. Each round we delay, your share loses 10% more value. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - you should take it now while the money holds more value for you.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your strategy of offering me less isn't working - your money is now worth only 65.61% of its original value. Even this $3000 now is worth more than $6500 would be in a few more rounds. If we continue, your share will be worth less than half its original value. This is your best opportunity to walk away with meaningful value. Let's finish this now.
