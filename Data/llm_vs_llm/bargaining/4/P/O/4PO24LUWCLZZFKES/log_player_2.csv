"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, but with a slight edge for me to account for future inflation impacting my share more. This ensures we both benefit significantly from this deal right away! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 and taking $5,500
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine maintains value
4. In the next round, $5,500 would only be worth $4,950 to Alice
5. This gives me negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for her

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. The inflation penalty on Alice's share gives me a stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's share loses 10% value each round, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still being reasonable, as she should understand that delaying costs her more.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since your share loses 10% value each round, it's in your interest to accept now. This is still a substantial amount for you, worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting me more each round. I need a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of my portion. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $4,000 and taking $6,000
2. This is actually worse for me than her first offer ($4,500)
3. Due to inflation, her $6,000 is only worth about $4,860 to her (81% of original value)
4. If we continue, her share will keep losing value while mine maintains value
5. She's trying to compensate for inflation by taking more, but this strategy doesn't make sense as it's against my interests
6. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, and time pressure is on her side

Since this offer is worse than the first one and I have a stronger negotiating position due to the inflation effect, I should reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money continues to lose value (now at 81% of original value), and she's still trying to get a larger share despite her weakening position, I'll maintain a firm stance while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. Your $4000 now is worth more than $6000 in a few rounds due to your inflation penalty. Each round we delay, your share loses 10% more value. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - you should take it now while the money holds more value for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation is killing me. I am giving you a significant portion. It is still worth more now than nothing if we run out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me even less ($3,500), down from her original $4,500
2. Her $6,500 share is only worth about $4,264 to her (65.61% of original value)
3. We're in round 5 out of 12, so there's still plenty of time
4. Her position continues to weaken with each round (34.39% loss already)
5. She's actually making increasingly worse offers despite her deteriorating position
6. If we continue a few more rounds, she'll lose almost half her money's value

This offer is clearly worse than all previous ones for me, and Alice seems to be playing against her own interests by making worse offers as her position weakens. I should definitely reject this and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Alice's position is significantly weakened now, with her share worth only 65.61% of its original value. Her strategy of offering me less while asking for more is counterproductive. I'll increase pressure while still leaving her a decent amount.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, your strategy of offering me less isn't working - your money is now worth only 65.61% of its original value. Even this $3000 now is worth more than $6500 would be in a few more rounds. If we continue, your share will be worth less than half its original value. This is your best opportunity to walk away with meaningful value. Let's finish this now.""}"
