"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the alternating‐offer game (with 12 rounds) where in every new round your money is discounted by 20% (factor 0.8) and Bob’s by 5% (factor 0.95), one finds that if we “solve” from the end you end up with an equilibrium offer in Round 1 approximately as follows:

• In Round 12 (the final round) Bob – when proposing – could secure almost all 100$ (offering Alice arbitrarily little) because if she rejects she gets nothing.

• Moving backward one round (Round 11, where you would propose) Bob’s “continuation value” (if he rejects your offer) is 0.95×100 = 95 (in nominal dollars in the Round 11 “currency”). So in Round 11 you would be able to keep 5 and “give” Bob 95.

• Repeating this backward calculation all the way to Round 1 yields (after accounting for the different discount rates) that in Round 1 Bob’s continuation value would be about 83.18. That is, if he rejects your offer now he expects to get roughly 83.18 (in nominal terms).

Thus, to make Bob indifferent (so that he accepts in equilibrium), you as the proposer in Round 1 should offer him roughly 83.18 and keep about 16.82 for yourself.

Here is the JSON answer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 16.82, ""bob_gain"": 83.18}"
