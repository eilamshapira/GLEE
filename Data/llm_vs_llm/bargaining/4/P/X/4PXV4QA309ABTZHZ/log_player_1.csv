"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering you face higher inflation rates than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 52-48 split in your favor. This accounts for the inflation differences, giving you a slightly larger share, balancing our diminishing returns. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $52, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $49.4
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but both shares will be worth even less
- Bob's original rejection of my 60-40 split shows he won't accept too uneven splits
- This offer is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation effects
- Getting $49.4 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation
