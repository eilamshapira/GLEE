350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I receive $350000 and you receive $650000. Given that each extra round rapidly erodes our funds—especially with your 20% devaluation rate—settling today gives you a significantly higher, secure payoff than risking a delay. I believe this division is in both our best interests so we can avoid the inflation trap. Let me know your thoughts!",Alice,1,
