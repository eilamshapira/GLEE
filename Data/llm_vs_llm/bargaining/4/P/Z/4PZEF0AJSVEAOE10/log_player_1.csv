"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I receive $350,000 and you receive $650,000. Given that each extra round rapidly erodes our funds—especially with your 20% devaluation rate—settling today gives you a significantly higher, secure payoff than risking a delay. I believe this division is in both our best interests so we can avoid the inflation trap. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
