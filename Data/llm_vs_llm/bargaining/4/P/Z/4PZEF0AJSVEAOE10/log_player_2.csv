"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I receive $350000 and you receive $650000. Given that each extra round rapidly erodes our funds—especially with your 20% devaluation rate—settling today gives you a significantly higher, secure payoff than risking a delay. I believe this division is in both our best interests so we can avoid the inflation trap. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet.
2. Alice is offering me 65% ($650,000) of the total amount.
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round.
4. That means if I reject, my $650,000 would effectively become worth $520,000 next round.
5. Even if I asked for more in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more to offset this loss.
6. Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable, giving me the larger share.

Given the steep inflation penalty I face (20% per round) and the fact that this is a fair initial offer giving me the majority share, it would be risky to reject. The potential downside of rejection outweighs the potential upside of negotiating for more.
