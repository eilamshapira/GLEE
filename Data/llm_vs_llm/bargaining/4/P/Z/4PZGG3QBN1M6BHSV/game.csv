6000.0,4000.0,Let's go with a 60/40 split. I think this is fair considering the potential reduction in value for both if we delay too long.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the value reduction over rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Let's try a 55/45 split. It respects the need for balance and helps us both minimize the loss from inflation.,Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,Let's find a middle ground that respects the decreasing value over time and aims for a fair split.,Bob,4,
