"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go with a 60/40 split. I think this is fair considering the potential reduction in value for both if we delay too long. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so she's considering 90% of $10,000, which is $9,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $10,000 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given the decreasing value over time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It respects the need for balance and helps us both minimize the loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and considering the offer of $4500, I need to calculate the actual value I'd be getting. Since it's 36% less, I'm effectively getting 64% of $4500.

64% of $4500 is $2880.

Considering this significant reduction and the fact that we're only in round 3, I should think about the potential for a better offer in the next rounds, but also be aware of the decreasing value over time.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money's value reduction, for me, it's now worth 48% of the original value (64% of 75% = 0.64 * 0.75 = 0.48, but since we started with 100% and went to 80% after round 1, then 64% after round 2, and now another 20% reduction, it's actually 64% * 0.8 = 51.2% after round 3, and for round 4, it's 51.2% * 0.8 = 40.96%), and for Alice, it's worth 81% of the original value (90% * 0.9 = 81%).

However, the correct calculation directly considering the rounds should reflect the decreasing value properly:
- After round 1, I had 80% value, then 64% after round 2, and after round 3, it should be 64% * 0.8 = 51.2%. For round 4, it's 51.2% * 0.8 = 40.96%.
- For Alice, after round 1, she had 90%, then 81% after round 2, and after round 3, it's 81% * 0.9 = 72.9%.

Given this, I should make an offer that considers these values but also aims to find a mutually agreeable split before the value decreases further.
