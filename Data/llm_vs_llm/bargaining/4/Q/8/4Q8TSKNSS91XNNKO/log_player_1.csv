"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis that takes into account that every round causes a “depreciation” in the players’ effective money (20% per round for you, 10% per round for Bob), here is one equilibrium calculation. (All amounts are in nominal dollars, but each round’s payoff is discounted for each player; for example, you value a dollar in round k at 0.8^(k–1) and Bob values it at 0.9^(k–1).)

A brief outline of the reasoning:
1. In round 12 (if reached, with Bob the proposer) Bob can propose to keep nearly all of the money, offering you essentially $0 because you’d get nothing if you reject. (In equilibrium, you accept even an offer of $0 because your alternative gets nothing.)
2. Stepping back one round (round 11, with you as proposer), you must offer Bob just enough so that his “discounted‐future” prospect (as he would propose in round 12) is matched. A short calculation shows you must offer him $900,000 in nominal dollars then (so that after one round of discounting his utility, it is as good as his future prospect).
3. Continuing this reasoning backward one round at a time (taking into account that in every round the “present‐value” discounts are 0.8 for you and 0.9 for Bob), the equilibrium divisions for later rounds would be:
  • Round 11 (Alice proposes): you get ≈$100,000; Bob gets ≈$900,000.
  • Round 10 (Bob proposes): you’d get ≈$80,000; Bob ≈$920,000.
  • Round 9 (Alice proposes): you get ≈$172,000; Bob ≈$828,000.
  • ⋯ (and so on).
4. When we roll the calculation all the way back to round 1 (with you making the proposal), the “continuation value” for Bob (if he waits to be the proposer in round 2) turns out to be roughly worth $692,612 in round‑1 dollars. (In round 2, Bob’s equilibrium proposal would yield him a nominal share of about $769,569—but with one round of discounting (10%), its value is about $692,612 in round‑1 “value”.)
5. Thus, to make Bob just indifferent to accepting now rather than waiting, your offer in round 1 should grant him about $692,612, leaving you with about $307,388.

That leads to the following proposal in JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 307387.83, ""bob_gain"": 692612.17}

This is our round‐1 offer."
