"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 692612.17 
# Alice gain: 307387.83 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

The total amount is $1,000,000, and Alice is offering me about 69.3% ($692,612.17).

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, but 20% less to Alice. This means Alice has more pressure to reach a deal quickly.

Given that:
1. I'm getting a substantial majority of the money
2. The offer is quite fair considering our different inflation rates
3. Rejecting would mean both of us get less value
4. We have the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
