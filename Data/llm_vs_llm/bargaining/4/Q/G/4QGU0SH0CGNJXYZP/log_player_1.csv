"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to secure a larger portion in this round to compensate for potential further losses.
* **Middle Ground:** While my previous offer was rejected, I'm moving closer to a middle ground to increase the chances of Bob accepting.  This offer still gives me a slight advantage but is more balanced than my initial proposal.
* **Uncertainty about Bob's Inflation:** I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the money's value.  He might be experiencing a slower rate of devaluation, so a more appealing offer could incentivize him to accept."
