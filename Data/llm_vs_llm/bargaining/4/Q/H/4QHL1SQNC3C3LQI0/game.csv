5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for me because your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10% per round). This way we both benefit from agreeing early, and the split is fair when accounting for our different discount rates.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair, especially since my share devalues faster. This way, we both start on equal footing and can aim to conclude the game early to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, given our different discount rates (mine 10%, yours 20%), I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for this difference. With each round, our money loses value at different rates, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer is more equitable when considering the time value of our money.",Alice,3,

4600.0,5400.0,"Alice, considering the devaluation rates and the fact that we're already in round 4, this split should be more beneficial for both of us. Let's aim to conclude the game soon to maximize our gains.",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5 and both losing significant value - I've lost over 34% and you've lost nearly 60% of initial value. I'm moving closer to an even split to help us reach agreement. This offer is fair considering our different discount rates and the increasingly urgent need to conclude. Let's not lose more value by continuing to negotiate.",Alice,5,
