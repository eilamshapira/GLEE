Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges our different discount rates and aims for a fair split given our situation.

""bob_gain"": 4500,

""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5 and both losing significant value - I've lost over 34% and you've lost nearly 60% of initial value. I'm moving closer to an even split to help us reach agreement. This offer is fair considering our different discount rates and the increasingly urgent need to conclude. Let's not lose more value by continuing to negotiate.""}"
