"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for me because your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10% per round). This way we both benefit from agreeing early, and the split is fair when accounting for our different discount rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
# Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the different devaluation rates, I think a more balanced initial offer would be fairer. How about we split it 5000 for you and 5000 for me? This way, we both get an equal share in the first round."

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given our different discount rates (mine 10%, yours 20%), I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for this difference. With each round, our money loses value at different rates, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer is more equitable when considering the time value of our money. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
# Alice, I appreciate your consideration, but I think we need to account for the devaluation more accurately. How about we split it 5200 for me and 4800 for you? This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation rates."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5 and both losing significant value - I've lost over 34% and you've lost nearly 60% of initial value. I'm moving closer to an even split to help us reach agreement. This offer is fair considering our different discount rates and the increasingly urgent need to conclude. Let's not lose more value by continuing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
