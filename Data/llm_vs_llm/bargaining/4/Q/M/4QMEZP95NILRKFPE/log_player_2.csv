"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This takes into account that time is more expensive for me (10% inflation rate vs. your 5%). If we keep negotiating, we both lose more value, so this is a fair first offer that maximizes our collective outcome. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
