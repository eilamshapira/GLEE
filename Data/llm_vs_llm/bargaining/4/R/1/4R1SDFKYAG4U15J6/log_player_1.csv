"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that money loses value faster for Bob (20%) than for me (5%) each round:

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair $4,000 - considering the 20% depreciation you face each round, it's better to accept now than to counter-offer.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fairer split, taking into account the depreciation you face.  Accept this and we both get a better deal than rejecting and facing further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money would be worth less for Bob in the next round (another 20% drop) while only 5% less for me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes this into account, as my negotiating position improves with each round due to the asymmetric inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money has depreciated twice for Bob (40% total) but only 10% for me, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor:

{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, the money has already lost 40% of its value for you, but only 10% for me. This $3,500 now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds. This is your best move.""
}"
