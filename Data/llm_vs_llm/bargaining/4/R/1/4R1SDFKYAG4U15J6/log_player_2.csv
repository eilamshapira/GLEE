Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money has already lost 40% of its value for you, but only 10% for me. This $3500 now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds. This is your best move. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
