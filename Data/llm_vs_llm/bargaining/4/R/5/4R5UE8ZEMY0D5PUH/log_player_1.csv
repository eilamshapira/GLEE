"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly after the 10% inflation. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money's value to me has only decreased by 5% while Bob assumes it decreased by 10%. I can make a better offer in the next round that accounts for the actual inflation rate I'm experiencing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, considering the actual inflation rates, I propose a 55-45 split. This is a fair compromise from my initial offer, and we should agree now before further inflation affects us both.""}"
