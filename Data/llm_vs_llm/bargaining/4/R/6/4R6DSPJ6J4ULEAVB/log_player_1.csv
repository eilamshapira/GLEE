"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I made the first move and took initiative in starting the negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a fair 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally and simplify the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. For Bob, due to 5% inflation, his $50 is actually worth $47.50
3. My $50 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we move to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. This is actually a pretty fair offer given the circumstances, and there's risk in continuing to negotiate
