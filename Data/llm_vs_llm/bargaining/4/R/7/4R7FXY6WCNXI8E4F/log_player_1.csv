"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable and reasonable for both of us. While I'm affected by 20% inflation per round and you're not, we're still early in the game and can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This even split respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
