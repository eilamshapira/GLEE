"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly skewed offer.  It's better to get something than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $10,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is only 1% of the total. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round for me (but not for Alice), there's pressure to agree sooner rather than later.

However, this initial offer is extremely skewed in Alice's favor. Since we're only in round 1 of 12 possible rounds, I have room to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable and reasonable for both of us. While I'm affected by 20% inflation per round and you're not, we're still early in the game and can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This even split respects both our interests.""}"
