I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Given the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise."
