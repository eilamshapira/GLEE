"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to maximize my gain while also ensuring Bob accepts the offer to avoid losing money to inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion ($4000) which hopefully makes him more likely to accept it, while still giving me a majority share. I'm hoping he values the immediate guaranteed money over the risk of potentially getting more later, especially considering the time limit and potential for both of us to get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and Bob's offer.

*   **Bob's Offer:** $3000 for me, $7000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less. So, $3000 now is worth $3000 * 0.95 = $2850 in Round 1 dollars.

Essentially, Bob is offering me the equivalent of $2850 in round 1 dollars and taking $7000 for himself. I think I can get more if I propose again.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to factor in the increasing inflation and Bob's previous offer. I rejected his offer of $3000 for me (equivalent to $2850 in round 1 dollars). I need to offer Bob enough to make it worthwhile for him to accept, but also aim to get more than that $2850 equivalent for myself, adjusted for the current inflation.

My inflation is now at 10% (5% per round).

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm offering Bob $4500, which is more than my initial offer. I'm hoping this makes him more amenable.
*   I'm asking for $5500 for myself. This is a smaller percentage of the total than my first offer but a larger absolute number, so it nets me more value given the inflation.
*   I'm still trying to balance maximizing my potential gain with the risk of rejection and further inflation. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting tense. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $2500 for me, $7500 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. So, $2500 now is worth $2500 * (1 - 0.1426) = $2500 * 0.8574 = $2143.50 in Round 1 dollars.

Bob is now offering me significantly less in equivalent Round 1 dollars than he did in Round 2. Given the inflation and the dwindling rounds, this is a terrible offer for me.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting critical. I'm at Round 5, inflation is biting, and Bob is offering increasingly worse deals. I need to make a calculated risk. My inflation is now 19.01%.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm increasing my ask to $5800. This seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. My money is losing value quickly.
*   This translates to a value of 5800*(1-0.1901) = $4697.42 in round 1 dollars.
*   I'm lowering Bob's share back down to $4200. I think that Bob is testing me at this point, and will continue to offer lower amounts to try to get more money.
*   I'm hoping that this split is aggressive enough to make Bob think that I'm serious about getting a good deal, while also being reasonable enough for him to accept rather than risk getting nothing.
*   I know that the risk of rejection is high, but the cost of accepting a bad deal at this point is too great due to inflation.
*   I am hoping Bob is rational and values guaranteed money more than trying to squeeze every last dollar."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an absolutely terrible offer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation. Let's calculate the real value:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $2000 for me, $8000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. So, $2000 now is worth $2000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $2000 * 0.7738 = $1547.60 in Round 1 dollars.

He's offering me the equivalent of $1547.60 from the beginning. That is unacceptable.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 7. This is getting very dangerous. Inflation is a major factor now. My inflation is 25.26%

Here's my offer. Given Bob's low offers recently, I need to consider if I should just make an offer which gets me something, or if I should still play to get more.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm increasing my demand significantly to $6200. At this point, inflation means that I'm losing value rapidly if I don't claim more of the pie.
*   The equivalent value in round 1 dollars is 6200 * (1 - 0.2526) = $4633.88.
*   I'm offering Bob $3800. This is the lowest offer yet, but I can't offer too much at this stage, as I am just losing money otherwise.
*   I am hoping that the large gain in the current round will be enough of an incentive to Bob, as opposed to risking it all.
*   I know the risk of rejection is high, but at this stage it is not worth accepting any lower amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is insulting. Bob is clearly trying to run me out of the game. Let's calculate the equivalent value:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $1500 for me, $8500 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. So, $1500 now is worth $1500 * (1 - 0.3017) = $1500 * 0.6983 = $1047.45 in Round 1 dollars.

He's offering me the equivalent of *one thousand and forty-seven dollars* from the beginning. This is a joke.

```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is it. Round 9. I have to be realistic. Bob is offering ridiculous amounts, and the clock is ticking. My inflation is now 34.68%. I need to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, even if it's not ideal.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I am offering a 50/50 split. This might be too late to recover from the previous rejections and Bob's perceived strategy, but it is the best I can do to try to get *something* rather than nothing.
*   In Round 1 dollars, I would be getting 5000 * (1 - 0.3468) = $3266. This is a far cry from my initial goal, but at this point survival is more important than maximizing profit.
*   I am hoping that the equal split will be seen as fair, and Bob will finally agree to end the game with a deal.
*   This is a last-ditch effort to salvage the situation before we both lose everything.
*   I need to consider the possibility that Bob is calling my bluff and will continue to refuse any offers. However, I must still try."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is beyond insulting. It's clear Bob is determined to get almost everything. Let's calculate the value:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $1000 for me, $9000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. So, $1000 now is worth $1000 * (1 - 0.3698) = $1000 * 0.6302 = $630.20 in Round 1 dollars.

He's offering me the equivalent of $630.20 from the beginning. Absolutely not.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is the penultimate round. I have one shot left to make a deal. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Bob is clearly trying to take everything.

My inflation is now 40.13%.

Given Bob's behavior, I'm going to try one last, desperate strategy.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm offering Bob a majority share of $6000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it's enough to finally get him to agree.
*   For me, $4000 at this stage is worth 4000 * (1 - 0.4013) = $2394.80 in Round 1 dollars. It's a terrible return compared to my initial aspirations, but it's better than nothing.
*   I'm banking on the fact that Bob might finally realize he's pushing it too far and that the risk of getting nothing in the final round is not worth the extra greed.
*   I am hoping that giving him such a large majority will be enough to close the deal, as I do not think I will get the chance to propose again.

This is it. My last and best offer."

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $500 for me, $9500 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. So, $500 now is worth $500 * (1 - 0.4312) = $500 * 0.5688 = $284.40 in Round 1 dollars.

He's offering me the equivalent of $284.40 from the beginning! After all this time and inflation, this is a complete waste. However, it is still better than nothing.
