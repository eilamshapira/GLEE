"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject now, the total amount will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. This means even if I propose to take the entire 10,000 in round 2, it would only be worth 8,000 to me. Alice's current offer gives me 5,000, which is better than what I might get after inflation.
