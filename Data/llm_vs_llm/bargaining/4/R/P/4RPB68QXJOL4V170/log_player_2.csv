"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you lose 5% value each round, while I don't. If you reject, you'll need to offer me at least this much to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is reasonable given the inflation penalty I face.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me will be 5% less (worth $950,000 to me). This means even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I'd be working with a smaller pie from my perspective.

Alice's offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the current full value. If I reject and the negotiation continues, I'd need to secure significantly more than 42.1% of the money in the next round just to break even (since 42.1% of $950,000 is approximately $400,000).

Given that Alice has no inflation penalty and can easily reject my next offer to make me face another 5% reduction, her initial offer of 40% is actually reasonable.
