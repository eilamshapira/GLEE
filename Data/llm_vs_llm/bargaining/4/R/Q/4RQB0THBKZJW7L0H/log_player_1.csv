"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. My goal is to get as much as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the offer before the rounds run out.

Here's my initial offer, aiming for a somewhat fair split to increase the chances of acceptance:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
