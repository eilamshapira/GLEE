"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. 4500$ in the next round would only be worth 3600$ to me due to inflation
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation is significant

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonable first offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, getting 4500$ now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
