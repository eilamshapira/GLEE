"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm willing to give you a 10% share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth less to me
4. Still, 10% seems quite low considering we should be equal negotiating partners
5. Even with inflation, I can probably get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation risk:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both win equally and don't risk losing value to inflation in further rounds.""}"
