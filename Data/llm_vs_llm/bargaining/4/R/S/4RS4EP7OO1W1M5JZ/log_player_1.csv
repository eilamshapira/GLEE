"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start the negotiation. Let's aim for a fair division while being mindful of the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is slightly in my favor, but accounts for the inflation risk I face if we need multiple rounds to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is pushing for a larger share. Let me make a more balanced counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is completely fair and accounts for the fact that I'm already experiencing inflation losses, making each round more costly for me than for you."
