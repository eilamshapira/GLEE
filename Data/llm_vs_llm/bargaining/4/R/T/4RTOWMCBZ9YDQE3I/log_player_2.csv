"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take this and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. While she's framing it as being generous, this is actually quite a low offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in subsequent rounds, I can safely reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while maintaining a firm but professional tone.

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this equally. A 50-50 division is the most reasonable solution for both of us.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, Bob. This offer is fair considering the inflation we've seen. Let's finish this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $400,000, which is a significant improvement from her first offer of $100,000
2. She's keeping $600,000, but that's worth 36% less to her due to inflation
3. My portion ($400,000) doesn't lose any value due to inflation
4. If I reject, we'll go another round, and Alice's portion will lose even more value
5. $400,000 for me is a reasonable amount, considering I have the advantage of no inflation

Given these factors, this is actually a pretty fair offer. The $600,000 Alice gets is worth significantly less to her due to inflation, and my $400,000 maintains its full value.
