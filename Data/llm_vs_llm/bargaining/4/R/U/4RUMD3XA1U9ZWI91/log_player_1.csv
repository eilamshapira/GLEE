"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a slightly higher share for myself. This reflects my advantage of 0% inflation compared to Bob's 5%.
*   **Reasonable:** The split isn't drastically unfair. I'm hoping Bob sees it as a good starting point, considering the ticking clock and the decreasing value of the money for him.
*   **Negotiation Room:** I'm leaving some room to negotiate in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer. I can concede a bit more to avoid reaching the deadline."
