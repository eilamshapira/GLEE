"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob. I want to consider the inflation factor in my proposal since I know that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the $100 - you get $50 and I get $50. This is a fair division that respects both our interests."
