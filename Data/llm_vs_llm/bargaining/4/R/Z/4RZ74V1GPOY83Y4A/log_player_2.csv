"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round
3. Even if I make a more aggressive proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation
4. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
