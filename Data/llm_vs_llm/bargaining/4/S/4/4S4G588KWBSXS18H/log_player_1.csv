"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that's slightly in my favor, as I'm making the first offer and there's the risk of a 10% loss if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while accounting for my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Bob's offer would give me $450,000 and him $550,000
2. Due to 10% inflation, my $450,000 is actually worth $405,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where everything will be worth 20% less than round 1
4. Even if I made a better split proposal in round 3, Bob might reject it, leading to even more value loss

While the offer gives Bob a larger share, accepting now prevents further value deterioration. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
