"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. However, I need to remember that due to inflation, each round reduces the value of money for me by 20%, while Alice faces no inflation penalty.

Since this is the first round, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and we go to the next round, my offer would be subject to 20% inflation for me. So $5,000 now is worth more to me than what might seem like a higher amount in future rounds.

Given the inflation factor and that this is a fair 50-50 split at full value, I should accept.
