"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect future rounds and we both need to reach an agreement:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties and should be acceptable to Bob."
