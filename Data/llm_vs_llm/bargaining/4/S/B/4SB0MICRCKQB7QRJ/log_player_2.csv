"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $2,000 while she takes $8,000 of the $10,000. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, if I reject this offer, my potential future gains will be worth less. However, this first offer is quite uneven.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would be only worth 80% of the original amount. I should try to negotiate for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer, considering the time pressure and declining value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a slightly better deal for myself while still giving Alice a substantial portion. This is fair considering we should be looking for a roughly equal split, and I face a 20% depreciation penalty each round while Alice doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer. Alice is now offering me $2,500 while taking $7,500. Due to inflation, my $2,500 is actually worth only $1,600 (64% of $2,500) compared to the original value in round 1.

If I reject and wait another round, any amount I receive will be worth only 51.2% of its original value (after another 20% reduction from the current 64%). The negotiation seems to be moving slowly, and time is working against me due to the asymmetric inflation that only affects my share.

While Alice's offer isn't ideal, I need to consider the declining value and limited rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Alice while still trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself, considering the ongoing depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair and reasonable for both parties, and given that I'm facing significant depreciation with each round while Alice isn't, I believe this balanced approach represents a good compromise."
