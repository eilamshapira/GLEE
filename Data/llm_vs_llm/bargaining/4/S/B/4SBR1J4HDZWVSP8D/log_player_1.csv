"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here’s my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 1, ""bob_gain"": 9999}

Let me explain briefly (without giving away the full backward‐induction reasoning):

Because every delay makes my (Alice’s) money lose 20% of its value while Bob’s money holds full value, if Bob rejects my proposal now he gains the privilege to propose in the next round with the full value of every dollar. In any equilibrium outcome, Bob’s “waiting‐option” is so attractive that to persuade him to accept immediately I must offer him nearly the entire 10,000$. Thus, to leave myself as much as possible (while keeping Bob just indifferent to waiting), I offer myself a nominal 1$ and Bob 9,999$, which in equilibrium forces acceptance.

What do you say, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
