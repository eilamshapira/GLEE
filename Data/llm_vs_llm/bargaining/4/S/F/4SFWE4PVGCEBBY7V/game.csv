208333.0,791667.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer: I take $208333 and you get $791667. This proposal reflects our respective discounting (20% loss per round for me, 5% for you) and is crafted so that you receive exactly what you’d expect to secure if you became proposer next round. Let’s avoid any further delay and the inevitable erosion of the pot. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,1,
