"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm ready to make my first offer. Considering the inflation, I'll try to secure as much as possible.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective (Alice):**  The original $100 is now worth 10% less to me.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's money is worth 20% less.
*   **Bob's offer:** He's offering me $50.

Since it's round 2, my $50 is worth only $50 - ($50 * 0.10) = $45.

Given the inflation and the number of rounds left, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
