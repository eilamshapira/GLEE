"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice offering me $40, and considering that waiting one round will cost me 5% due to inflation:
- If I accept now, I get $40
- If I wait to make a counter-offer, any amount I might get will be worth 5% less
- To break even on waiting, I'd need to secure at least $42.11 in the next round ($42.11 * 0.95 = $40)

While 60-40 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer. Given the inflation penalty, trying to negotiate for a better deal might end up leaving me with less value. The risk of losing value through inflation outweighs the potential gain from a counter-offer.
