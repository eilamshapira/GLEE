"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $60, which is a decent amount. However, I know that:
1. Each round makes the money worth 20% less for Alice, but stays the same value for me
2. If I reject, I can make the next offer
3. We have 11 more rounds if needed
4. Alice will be more motivated to accept a lower amount in later rounds due to inflation

Since I'm in a stronger position (no inflation penalty), I can probably get a better deal by rejecting this and offering a more favorable split for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's fairly reasonable first offer, I should make a strategic offer that takes into account:
1. Alice is now facing 20% depreciation from round 1
2. She might still reject if I'm too aggressive
3. I want to offer enough to make it attractive for her to accept now rather than continue

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than her first offer but isn't too greedy:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This gives me a better deal than her initial offer, but still leaves Alice with $30 which, even after one round of depreciation (worth $24 to her now), might be attractive enough to accept rather than risk further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 64 
# Alice gain: 36 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me $64, which is better than her first offer of $60
2. For Alice, her $36 share is actually worth only $23.04 (36% less) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth even less (44% less than initial)
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have 9 rounds left after this

Given that I'm in an increasingly stronger position due to the inflation only affecting Alice, and her offer isn't substantially better than her first one, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer considering:
1. Alice's money is now worth 44% less than in round 1
2. She's shown willingness to negotiate but has rejected my previous 70/30 split
3. If she rejects this offer, her next offer will be worth even less to her (52% less than round 1)
4. I need to make it attractive enough for her to accept now

Since her $36 was worth only $23.04 to her in the last round, I'll offer an amount that gives me more but still makes it worthwhile for her to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

This $25 for Alice is worth about $14 to her now (after 44% depreciation), but if she waits another round, any amount will be worth even less to her. This should create pressure to accept while giving me a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 68 
# Alice gain: 32 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me $68, which is the highest offer from her so far
2. For Alice, her $32 share is actually worth only $13.11 (59.04% less) due to compounding inflation
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in round 6
   - Alice's money will be worth about 67% less than initial value
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have 7 rounds left after this

It's interesting that Alice is still offering a relatively modest amount despite the severe inflation affecting her share. Since her money is losing value so quickly and I maintain my bargaining power, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point:
1. Alice's money is worth 67% less than round 1
2. She's shown resilience but the inflation is severely impacting her gains
3. She's already offered me $68, showing she's willing to give up more
4. Any further delays make her position worse
5. I need to make an offer that's clearly better than continuing for her

Given that her $32 was only worth $13.11 to her in the last round, I'll make a more aggressive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

This $20 for Alice is worth only about $6.60 to her after 67% depreciation, but if she rejects and we continue, any future amount will be worth even less to her. The rapidly increasing inflation should make this offer more appealing than continuing the negotiation, while giving me a very good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 72 
# Alice gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me $72, continuing her pattern of gradually increasing offers
2. For Alice, her $28 share is worth only $7.34 (73.79% less) due to severe inflation
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in round 8
   - Alice's money will be worth about 79% less than initial value
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have 5 rounds left

Alice is still offering me less than my last offer of $80, and with inflation severely impacting her share, her bargaining position is getting weaker with each round. Given that my position continues to strengthen and we have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice's money is now worth 79% less than round 1
2. She's consistently rejected offers above 80% for me
3. She just offered me $72, showing she's willing to go higher than before
4. The severe inflation means even smaller amounts are becoming negligible for her
5. However, she's shown she's willing to continue despite the severe depreciation

Given her demonstrated resilience but the extreme inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 85, ""alice_gain"": 15}

This $15 for Alice is worth only about $3.15 to her after 79% depreciation. While this is an aggressive offer, the mathematics of the situation make it increasingly irrational for her to continue - any future amount will be worth even less to her due to inflation. She should realize that accepting now is better than continuing, while this gives me a very strong return."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 76 
# Alice gain: 24 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me $76, still gradually increasing but less than my last offer of $85
2. For Alice, her $24 share is worth only $4.03 (83.22% less) due to extreme inflation
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in round 10
   - Alice's money will be worth about 86.6% less than initial value
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have 3 rounds left

Alice is showing remarkable resilience despite the severe inflation affecting her share. However, her position continues to weaken dramatically while mine remains strong. Given that she's still offering me less than what I proposed, and the inflation effect is becoming extreme, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this critical stage:
1. Alice's money is worth 86.6% less than round 1
2. She's shown surprising determination, continuing to reject high splits despite severe inflation
3. We only have 2 rounds left after this
4. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in the final rounds is becoming real
5. I need to balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring an agreement

Given her persistent resistance despite the extreme inflation, I'll slightly moderate my previous offer:

{""bob_gain"": 82, ""alice_gain"": 18}

This $18 for Alice is worth only about $2.41 after 86.6% depreciation, but it's slightly better than my last offer of $15. While I could maintain my more aggressive stance, the risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement (where we both get nothing) makes it prudent to show some flexibility. This offer still gives me an excellent return while potentially being more acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully analyze this critical situation:

1. We're in the penultimate round - only one round left after this
2. Alice has offered me $80, her highest offer yet
3. For Alice, her $20 share is worth only $2.15 (89.26% less) due to extreme inflation
4. If I reject:
   - I can make one final offer
   - But if Alice rejects that, we BOTH get NOTHING
   - Alice's money will be worth about 91.4% less
5. The risk of getting nothing is now very real

Given that:
- This is actually a good offer ($80 for me)
- We're dangerously close to both getting nothing
- Alice has demonstrated she's willing to risk getting nothing by rejecting high splits
- My $80 maintains full value while her share is already minimal

The risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential benefit of trying for a slightly better split in the final round.
