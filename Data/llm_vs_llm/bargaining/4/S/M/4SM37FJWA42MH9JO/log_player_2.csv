"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives us both a good starting point, and it avoids further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us loses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your offer because I believe I deserve a little more. The money you get is already worth 10% less than the original offer. I offer a 52/48 split. It's a slight increase for me and still gives you a significant portion, accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
