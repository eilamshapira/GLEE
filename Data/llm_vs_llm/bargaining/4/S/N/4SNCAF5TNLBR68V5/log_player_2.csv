"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, the nominal amount remains $10,000. I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than a 50/50 split would be after accounting for the value reduction.

""alice_gain"": 6200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4200 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) = $2688.

For Alice, the value is $5800 * 0.81 (since 10% less in round 1 and another 9% less in round 2, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) = $4698.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor, but I need to consider the decreasing value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me each round, so after 3 rounds, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 of its original value. For Alice, it's worth 10% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729 of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since I've rejected previous offers, I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Alice while still considering my own loss due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""alice_gain"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4400 * 0.4096 (since 20% less each round for 4 rounds, which is 0.8^4 = 0.4096) = $1802.24.

For Alice, the value is $5600 * 0.6561 (since 10% less each round for 4 rounds, which is 0.9^4 = 0.6561) = $3673.56.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not very favorable to me, but the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I need to consider whether accepting this offer is better than risking further decreases in value.
