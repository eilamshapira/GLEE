"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end the game 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem entirely fair to me. She's proposing to take $600,000 while giving me $400,000, which is a 60/40 split in her favor. While she calls it a ""fair share,"" a truly fair division would be closer to 50/50.

I'll reject this offer so I can make a counter-proposal in the next round.
