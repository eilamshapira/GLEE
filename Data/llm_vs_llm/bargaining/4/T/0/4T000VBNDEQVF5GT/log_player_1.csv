"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm playing as Alice and making the first offer, I'll consider that Bob's money will be worth 5% less each round if he rejects. This gives me some negotiating leverage. I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split as a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's time pressure due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. For me (Alice), $500,000 is worth full value
3. For Bob, his $500,000 is actually only worth $475,000 (95% of original value) due to inflation
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less to him in the next round
5. However, my previous offer was rejected, suggesting Bob wants a more equal split

Given that I can make another offer next round where Bob's position will be even weaker due to inflation, and my original offer of $600,000 for myself wasn't accepted, I'll reject this and try again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my first 60-40 split and offered 50-50, but is now facing 10% total inflation (5% from round 1 and another 5% from round 2), I can propose a slightly more aggressive split.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose this 65-35 split because:
1. Bob's share will be worth only $315,000 to him due to the 10% inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round will face 15% inflation
3. This makes accepting now more attractive than continuing negotiations
4. Yet it improves my position from my initial offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 55-45 split
2. For me (Alice), $550,000 is worth full value
3. For Bob, his $450,000 is actually only worth about $386,000 (85.74% of original value) due to compound inflation
4. Bob has increased his offer to me from his previous 50-50 split
5. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less to him in the next round
6. The negotiations are moving in my favor, with Bob offering more each time

Given that the trend is in my favor and Bob's money will be worth even less next round (making my negotiating position stronger), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the progression of negotiations and the increasing inflation pressure on Bob (now his share is affected by approximately 19% inflation if he rejects), I can propose an even stronger split in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose this 70-30 split because:
1. Bob's previous offers show an upward trend in my favor (from 50-50 to 55-45)
2. Bob's share will be worth only about $243,000 to him due to the current inflation
3. If he rejects, his next round will face nearly 24% inflation
4. The diminishing value of future rounds for Bob makes accepting now more rational
5. This continues the pattern of increasing my share while leaving Bob with a still significant portion"
