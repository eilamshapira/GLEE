"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the total value will be $950,000 for me in the next round ($1,000,000 Ã— 0.95). 

I think I can make a better offer for myself in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer now, keeping in mind that due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is worth 5% less to me in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both an equal share and represents a reasonable compromise from Alice's previous offer. I believe this is a fair division that Alice should find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has rejected my 50-50 split and has now offered me even less than her initial offer ($350,000 instead of $400,000).

I need to consider the inflation effect carefully:
- We're now in round 3, so the money is worth 9.75% less to me
- If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will be worth 14.26% less to me (compounding 5% loss each round)
- My $350,000 offer now is effectively worth about $315,875 in original value to me

If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll be working with money that's worth even less to me, and Alice seems to be driving a hard bargain.

However, this offer is worse than her first offer, which suggests she might be trying to exploit the inflation penalty. I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round despite the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice will accept, considering that the money is now worth 14.26% less to me due to the compounding inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose that I receive $450,000 and Alice receives $550,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous 50-50 split offer and Alice's offers. Even with the inflation penalty affecting me, this division gives me a better outcome than Alice's last offer of $350,000, while giving Alice a substantial share that's better than an equal split. I hope Alice will find this division acceptable so we can conclude our negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has rejected my compromise offer and is now offering me even less: $300,000, while taking $700,000 for herself.

Let me carefully analyze the situation:
- We're in round 5, with my money worth 18.55% less than in round 1
- My $300,000 now is effectively worth about $244,350 in original value to me
- If I reject and we go to round 6, the money will be worth approximately 22.62% less to me
- Alice seems to be strategically reducing her offers as the rounds progress, exploiting the inflation that only affects me

Alice is clearly leveraging her inflation advantage. If I reject again, she'll likely offer even less in round 7. The trend is not in my favor, and the decreasing value due to inflation makes my negotiating position increasingly weaker.

While I'm not happy with only getting $300,000, I need to acknowledge the game dynamics and make a pragmatic decision.
