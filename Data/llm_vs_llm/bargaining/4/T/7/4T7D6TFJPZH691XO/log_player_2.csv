"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it equally and both enjoy a fair share of the winnings! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. If I accept now, I get $500,000
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The total value will be worth 5% less to me
   - I could try to get more, but Alice might reject
   - Each subsequent round reduces value by another 5%

A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and getting $500,000 now is better than risking a 5% reduction in value. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a solid offer.
