"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split, which would give me $50.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no pressure for me to accept immediately from a time perspective. However, we only have 12 rounds total to reach an agreement or we both get nothing.

This is a fair opening offer. While I could reject and counter with something that gives me more, there's a risk Alice might not accept, and we could end up with nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers.
