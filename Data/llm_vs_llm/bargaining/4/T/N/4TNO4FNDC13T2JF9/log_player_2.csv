"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. 55 for me, 45 for you. This leaves us both with a good amount and avoids inflation worries. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 55/45 split in her favor. While this isn't quite an equal division, I need to factor in the inflation penalty. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the maximum I could get would be 95% of the original value.

Let me evaluate: If I accept now, I get $45. If I reject and propose something better next round, I'd face a 5% penalty on whatever amount we agree on. So even if I could negotiate for $50 in the next round, that would actually be worth $47.50 to me due to inflation.

Given these considerations, it's probably best to accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation of value.
