550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where I get $550k and you get $450k. This is almost 50-50, just slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we go to another round. I think this is fair for both of us to accept now rather than prolonging negotiations.",Alice,1,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I see that we both want to avoid further inflation losses. I've adjusted my offer to be more balanced - I get $525k and you get $475k. This accounts for the fact that I'm facing a 10% inflation penalty if we go another round, and you're facing a 15% penalty. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount without risking further devaluation of our shares.",Alice,3,
