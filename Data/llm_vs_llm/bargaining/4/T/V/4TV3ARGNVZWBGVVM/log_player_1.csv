"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that is fair but also takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where I get $550k and you get $450k. This is almost 50-50, just slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we go to another round. I think this is fair for both of us to accept now rather than prolonging negotiations.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. You'll still get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds and the potential for both of us losing money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I see that we both want to avoid further inflation losses. I've adjusted my offer to be more balanced - I get $525k and you get $475k. This accounts for the fact that I'm facing a 10% inflation penalty if we go another round, and you're facing a 15% penalty. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount without risking further devaluation of our shares.""
