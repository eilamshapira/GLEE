"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where I get $550k and you get $450k. This is almost 50-50, just slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we go to another round. I think this is fair for both of us to accept now rather than prolonging negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split. You'll still get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds and the potential for both of us losing money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we both want to avoid further inflation losses. I've adjusted my offer to be more balanced - I get $525k and you get $475k. This accounts for the fact that I'm facing a 10% inflation penalty if we go another round, and you're facing a 15% penalty. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount without risking further devaluation of our shares. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
