"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $350,000 while taking $650,000 for herself. This is significantly less than half of the total amount. Considering inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, if I reject now and propose in the next round, the total would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. Even if I end up with a 50-50 split of that amount ($450,000), it would still be better than the current offer of $350,000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this split because I need to account for the 10% inflation that affects me. A perfectly equal split would be 500k each, but since I've already lost 10% of the value from the first round, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself to compensate for that loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. Alice is now offering me $400,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. However, due to inflation, this $400,000 is worth 19% less than money in round 1, meaning it's effectively worth $400,000 Ã— 0.81 = $324,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation for me would increase to approximately 29% (10% more than current 19%), making any money worth even less to me.

Alice has revealed that she faces 36% inflation, which is significantly higher than mine. This suggests she has stronger incentives to reach an agreement sooner.

Since Alice's new offer ($400,000) gives me an effective value of $324,000, which is less than her initial offer's value of $350,000, and the inflation penalty will continue to grow, I should accept this offer.
