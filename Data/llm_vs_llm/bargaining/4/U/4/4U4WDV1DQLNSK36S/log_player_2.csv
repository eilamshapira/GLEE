"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject and propose my own offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me. That means even if I managed to get the entire 1,000,000 in round 2, it would only be worth 900,000 to me. So getting 500,000 now is better than potentially getting less than 900,000 in the future rounds with the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement.
