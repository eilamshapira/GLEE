"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair game, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer. With 20% inflation per round for me, it's important to reach an agreement soon, but I also want to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 will be worth 20% less to me, so effectively I'd be dividing $80 in value (from my perspective).

Given that, Alice's 50-50 split offer in the first round is actually quite reasonable, as it gives me $50 without any inflation penalty.
