"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without risking inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and there's no need to worry about inflation affecting our gains in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $5000 but with 10% inflation, so effectively $4500
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I receive will be worth another 10% less
- My first offer of $5500 would have been worth $5500, which was better
- But now that it's rejected, I need to consider the current situation
- If I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to inflation
- $4500 now is better than potentially less later
