"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me only 10% of the total amount ($100,000)
2. While $100,000 is still a significant sum, it's a very uneven split
3. Even with 20% inflation per round, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. The total amount in round 2 would still be worth $800,000, giving me room to propose a more favorable split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This is a fair proposal because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split
2. Alice still gets a slight advantage
3. Given the 20% inflation per round, it would be rational for Alice to accept this rather than risk further devaluation
4. It's significantly better than the previous 90-10 split Alice proposed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is now offering me 40% of the total ($400,000)
2. Due to 36% inflation, this $400,000 is actually worth about $256,000 in round 1 value
3. However, if I reject, the next round will have 48.8% inflation from original value
4. This is a significant improvement from Alice's first offer (10-90 split)
5. The split is getting more reasonable (40-60)
6. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation

Given these factors, especially the increasing impact of inflation and the relatively fair split, I'll accept this offer.
