"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being fair enough that Bob should accept it rather than risk inflation reducing the total value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because it's a fair 50-50 split, and rejecting it would mean losing 5% more value to inflation in the next round. While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the risk of further value loss and potential deadlock makes this even split a reasonable outcome."
