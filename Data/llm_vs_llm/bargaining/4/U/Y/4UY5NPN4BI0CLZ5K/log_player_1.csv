"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $350,000. Consider that with inflation, waiting will reduce the value for both of us. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you get $450000 and I get $550000. This is much fairer than your initial offer, and since you're concerned about inflation, it would be wise to accept this reasonable proposal now rather than continuing further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 Ã— 0.95 = $427,500 (after 5% inflation)
   * Bob gets $550,000

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation losses
   * The longer this goes, the weaker my position becomes

While this isn't as much as my initial offer, it's still a decent amount considering the inflation effect. If I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to compounding inflation.
