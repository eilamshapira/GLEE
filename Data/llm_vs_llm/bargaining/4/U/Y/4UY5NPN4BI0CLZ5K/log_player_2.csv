"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $350000. Consider that with inflation, waiting will reduce the value for both of us. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $350,000 (35% of the total)
2. She's keeping $650,000 (65% of the total)
3. She mentions inflation, but for me, there's actually no inflation effect (0%)
4. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I don't lose value by waiting
5. As the next proposer, I would have more leverage to make a better offer

This split is not favorable enough for me, and since I don't suffer from inflation, I can afford to reject and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving myself a slight advantage since I'm the proposer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you get $450,000 and I get $550,000. This is much fairer than your initial offer, and since you're concerned about inflation, it would be wise to accept this reasonable proposal now rather than continuing further rounds.""}"
