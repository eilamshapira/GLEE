5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, every additional round costs me 5% due to inflation, so I’d really appreciate settling this now. I propose a quick 55-45 split in your favor—$5500 for you and $4500 for me. This way, you secure a strong share while we both avoid further delays. I hope you agree to this fair, time-sensitive offer.",Bob,2,
