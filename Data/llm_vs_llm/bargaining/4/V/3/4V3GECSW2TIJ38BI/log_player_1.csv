"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round costs me 5% due to inflation, so I’d really appreciate settling this now. I propose a quick 55-45 split in your favor—$5500 for you and $4500 for me. This way, you secure a strong share while we both avoid further delays. I hope you agree to this fair, time-sensitive offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. In round 1, I offered myself $6000
2. Now with 5% inflation, if I accept $5500, it's actually worth $5225 to me
3. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth another 5% less
4. Bob's offer is reasonable and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly
