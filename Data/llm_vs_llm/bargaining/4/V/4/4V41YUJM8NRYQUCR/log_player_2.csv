"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * $400,000 now > $800,000 Ã— 0.8 = $640,000 in next round
3. Alice's appeal to avoid inflation is valid
4. While 60-40 split favors Alice, it's a reasonable first offer

Given that inflation will significantly impact my gains in future rounds, and this is a decent opening offer, I'll accept.
