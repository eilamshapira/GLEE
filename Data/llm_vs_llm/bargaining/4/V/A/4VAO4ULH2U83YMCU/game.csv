55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split. Given that we're facing inflation with each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. The money will be worth less for both of us if we delay, so this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think we can do a little better to find something mutually agreeable. How about we switch it up – 55 for me, 45 for you? It's still a substantial amount for both of us, especially considering the inflation.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 52/48 split. With inflation now at 20% for me, we're both losing value with each passing round. This is a fair compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and we both benefit from reaching agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate while our money loses value.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  Let's just split it down the middle – 50/50.  It's clean, it's fair, and it stops us both from losing out to this inflation any further.",Bob,4,
