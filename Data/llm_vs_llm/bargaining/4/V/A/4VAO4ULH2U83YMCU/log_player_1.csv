"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split. Given that we're facing inflation with each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. The money will be worth less for both of us if we delay, so this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think we can do a little better to find something mutually agreeable. How about we switch it up – 55 for me, 45 for you? It's still a substantial amount for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 52/48 split. With inflation now at 20% for me, we're both losing value with each passing round. This is a fair compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and we both benefit from reaching agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate while our money loses value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  Let's just split it down the middle – 50/50.  It's clean, it's fair, and it stops us both from losing out to this inflation any further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
