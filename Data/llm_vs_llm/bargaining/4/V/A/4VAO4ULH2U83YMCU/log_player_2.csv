"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split. Given that we're facing inflation with each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. The money will be worth less for both of us if we delay, so this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think we can do a little better to find something mutually agreeable. How about we switch it up – 55 for me, 45 for you? It's still a substantial amount for both of us, especially considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 52/48 split. With inflation now at 20% for me, we're both losing value with each passing round. This is a fair compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and we both benefit from reaching agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate while our money loses value. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer but it's getting close. My goal is to get Alice to agree to a 50/50 split, or something very near it.  I'm hoping the increasing inflation will push her in that direction."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  Let's just split it down the middle – 50/50.  It's clean, it's fair, and it stops us both from losing out to this inflation any further.""}"
