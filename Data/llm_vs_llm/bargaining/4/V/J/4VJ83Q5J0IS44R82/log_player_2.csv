"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and end the game quickly! I'm offering you 40% of the pot. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and the impact of inflation.

In the first round, the total amount available is $10,000, and Alice is offering me $4,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject this offer, I will have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the total amount available to me will decrease by 5% in each subsequent round.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's difficult to predict her behavior. However, considering the offer is relatively low, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

For now, I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation factor, I want to make a reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

I'll offer Alice 45% of the original amount, which is $4,500, and I'll keep 55% for myself, which is $5,500.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial split. I'm offering a slightly higher percentage than I received in the previous round. Hopefully, we can agree on this and end the game quickly.""}"
