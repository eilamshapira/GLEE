"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ and keeping 5500$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. 5% of 4500$ is 225$, so next round my money will only be worth 4275$ in today's value
4. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While the split isn't completely fair (45/55), the loss from inflation makes accepting now more attractive than risking future rounds. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
