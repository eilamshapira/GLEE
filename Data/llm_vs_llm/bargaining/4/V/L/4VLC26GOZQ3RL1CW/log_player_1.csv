Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I rejected your offer because it wasn't equal. Let's go for a 50-50 split this time. It's fair and we both benefit equally before inflation hits harder. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
