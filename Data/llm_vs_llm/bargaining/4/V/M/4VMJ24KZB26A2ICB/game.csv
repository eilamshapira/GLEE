550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me at 55-45. I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty per round, so I'd prefer to settle early. This offer gives you a substantial $450000 while acknowledging my time pressure.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 60/40, acknowledging that I'm facing inflation as well.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer, but I need to clarify something - I'm the one facing 5% inflation each round, making my share worth less the longer we negotiate. I've adjusted my offer to give you more ($480000) while still accounting for my inflation penalty. This is a fair compromise considering our different time pressures.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 55/45. This ensures a fair split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face due to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a more equitable split. I'm now proposing a straight 50/50 split despite my significant inflation penalty (which is now over 15%). This is actually disadvantageous for me compared to your previous offer due to inflation, but I'm offering this even split in the spirit of fairness and to conclude our negotiation. Please consider that with each round, my position weakens substantially while yours remains steady.",Alice,5,
