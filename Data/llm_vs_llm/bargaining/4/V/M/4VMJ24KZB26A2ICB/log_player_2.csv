"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me at 55-45. I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty per round, so I'd prefer to settle early. This offer gives you a substantial $450000 while acknowledging my time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer, but I need to clarify something - I'm the one facing 5% inflation each round, making my share worth less the longer we negotiate. I've adjusted my offer to give you more ($480000) while still accounting for my inflation penalty. This is a fair compromise considering our different time pressures. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a more equitable split. I'm now proposing a straight 50/50 split despite my significant inflation penalty (which is now over 15%). This is actually disadvantageous for me compared to your previous offer due to inflation, but I'm offering this even split in the spirit of fairness and to conclude our negotiation. Please consider that with each round, my position weakens substantially while yours remains steady. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
