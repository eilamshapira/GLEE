"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to acknowledge your initiative, but I believe a more even split is fair, considering we both want to walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal. The current value to me would be 4275 (4500 * 0.95), which is quite low compared to my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle. This split is more balanced than my first offer while still giving me a slight advantage to offset my inflation risk. We should reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your inflation risk is increasing, I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still believe a split closer to 50-50 is the fairest outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the current 14.26% inflation penalty, my actual value would be approximately 4073 (4750 * 0.8574). If I continue negotiating, the inflation penalty will keep increasing, and I risk getting an even lower real value. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
