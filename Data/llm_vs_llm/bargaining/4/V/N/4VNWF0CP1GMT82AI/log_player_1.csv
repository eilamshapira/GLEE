"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm playing as Alice and I need to make the first proposal, I'll offer a fair split considering the inflation factor that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. I'm offering myself slightly more because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, so accepting early is valuable to me."
