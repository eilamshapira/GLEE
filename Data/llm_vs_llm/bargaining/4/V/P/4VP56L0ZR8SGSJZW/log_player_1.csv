"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is pushing for a larger share. Let me make a slightly adjusted offer that's still fair but acknowledges the inflation effect on his side.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering you $5,500 and I'll take $4,500. I understand that inflation affects your gains more than mine, so I'm willing to adjust from my initial equal split to accommodate that factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is consistently seeking a larger share, likely to compensate for the increasing inflation effect. Let me propose a more accommodating offer that considers this factor.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering you $6,000 and I'll take $4,000. Given that inflation is significantly affecting your gains (now 27.1% less valuable to you than in round 1), this division should help offset that effect while still being reasonable for both of us."
