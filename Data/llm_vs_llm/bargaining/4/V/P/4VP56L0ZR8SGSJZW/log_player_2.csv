"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I need to push for a larger share before the money loses too much value."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a somewhat unfavorable deal now than risk getting even less later as inflation continues to erode the value."
