"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains and need to account for the 20% inflation penalty if we move to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount and avoids the risk of losing value through inflation in subsequent rounds."
