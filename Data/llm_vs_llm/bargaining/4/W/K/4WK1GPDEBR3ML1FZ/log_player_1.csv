Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the value of money decreases each round, I need a slightly better offer to compensate for the potential inflation in the upcoming rounds. This split is still fair and will leave us both with a decent sum. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to the deadline, and the money is losing value. I believe this is a fair offer now, considering the time left and the impact of inflation on our respective shares. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation.  While my potential gains are decreasing significantly, his offer doesn't reflect the true impact of inflation on both sides. It's important to stand my ground for a fairer deal."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, our positions deteriorate. This is my final offer, balancing the need to secure a reasonable sum for myself against the risk of getting nothing. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, and Bob knows it.  While the decreasing value is a huge factor, accepting this offer would mean I lose significantly more to inflation than Bob does.  I'm betting he's bluffing about this being his final offer, and the risk of getting nothing is the same for both of us."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of our money is diminishing quickly. This is my last and best offer, which will provide us both with an amount that's better than nothing. I urge you to accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept this offer, but time has become the biggest enemy.  While unfair, accepting guarantees me something rather than nothing.  Bob has played this strategically, and at this point, the risk of rejecting is too high."
