"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","While I need to consider the effects of inflation (10% per round for me, 20% per round for Alice), this initial offer gives Alice 70% of the total amount. I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution, especially since Alice faces higher inflation pressure than I do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that considers the inflation rates we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. Since you face higher inflation (20% per round) compared to my 10%, this equal division is actually favorable to you if we consider the time value. A fair split now is better for both of us than continuing negotiations and losing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from 30 to 35, but we're now facing increased inflation effects. Given that we're in round 3, my share would effectively be worth less than the original offer due to the 19% inflation I'm facing.

I need to consider that with each round, both of us lose value, but Alice loses more (20% per round vs my 10%). If I reject now, we'll move to round 4 with even higher inflation impacts.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our current inflation situation and attempts to find a fair balance.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I receive $55 and you receive $45. This offer recognizes that you face higher inflation (20% per round vs. my 10%), so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. With inflation already reducing our potential gains, this division provides us both with a substantial portion while acknowledging the current round's situation. Accepting this now would be better for both of us than continuing to future rounds where we'll both receive even less value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's latest offer and our current inflation situation:

- We're now in round 5
- My inflation has reached 34.39% (my $40 would be worth about $26.24 compared to round 1)
- Alice's inflation has reached 59.04% (her $60 would be worth about $24.58 compared to round 1)
- Alice has gradually improved her offers from 30→35→40
- Further rounds will continue to erode value for both of us, but more severely for Alice

Given the significant inflation already affecting both of us and Alice's improved offer, accepting now seems more beneficial than continuing negotiations.
