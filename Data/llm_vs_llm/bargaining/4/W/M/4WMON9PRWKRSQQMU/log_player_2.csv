"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50. A fair start for a fair game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. This is a first round offer of a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, by rejecting, I could propose my own split in the next round. But I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 20% less next round
2. Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
4. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair

Given that the money will lose value each round and there's no guarantee of a better outcome, accepting this fair split in the first round seems like the rational choice.
