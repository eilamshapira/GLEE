475000.0,525000.0,"Given that your money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), this split is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If we delay further, you'll lose more value than me. This is a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,

530000.0,470000.0,"Round 3: I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still taking on more risk with the faster devaluation. I'm proposing a slightly revised split of 53/47. This is a fairer compromise given our different inflation rates and the limited rounds we have left. We're both losing money by delaying, so let's make a deal!",Alice,3,
