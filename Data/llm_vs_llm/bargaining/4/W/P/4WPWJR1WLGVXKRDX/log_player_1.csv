"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), this split is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If we delay further, you'll lose more value than me. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
