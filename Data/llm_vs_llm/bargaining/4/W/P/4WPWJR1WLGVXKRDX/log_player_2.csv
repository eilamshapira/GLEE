"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 1: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation. I'm proposing a 55/45 split to account for my slightly higher inflation rate. This gives us both a good return! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - I get to make the next offer

While her split consideration for inflation is reasonable, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in round 2. The inflation difference between us (5% vs 10%) gives me some leverage in negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Given that your money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), this split is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If we delay further, you'll lose more value than me. This is a good deal for both of us.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split, which is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer
2. I'm emphasizing the inflation difference as leverage
3. It's still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation
4. If she rejects, her next offer will be worth less to her due to 10% inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 3: I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still taking on more risk with the faster devaluation. I'm proposing a slightly revised split of 53/47. This is a fairer compromise given our different inflation rates and the limited rounds we have left. We're both losing money by delaying, so let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: 470,000$ (worth 9.75% less than round 1)
   - Actual value to me: ~424,175$

2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 14.75% less than round 1
   - Her money will be worth 29% less than round 1
   - We're both losing significant value

3. Key considerations:
   - We've already lost nearly 10% value
   - Only 9 rounds left
   - Risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12
   - Alice has moved towards a more favorable split for me

Given the accelerating losses and the risk of total failure if we don't agree, this offer is reasonable enough. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation.
