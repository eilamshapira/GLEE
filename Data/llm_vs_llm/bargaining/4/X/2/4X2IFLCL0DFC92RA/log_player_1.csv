"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $40 offered to me is equivalent to $40 * 0.95 = $38.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each round, and we are now in the 3rd round, the money I gain is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less than in the first round, which is 0.9 times the original value, but then another 5% for this round, so 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.855.

To maximize my gain, I'll offer Bob a smaller amount.
