60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, it's better for both of us to make a deal now rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my first-mover position.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hey Alice, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation penalty we both face.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure if I'll accept a lower share in the next round. Let's make a deal.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I understand we both face inflation penalties, but mine is more severe at 20% per round while yours is only 10%. My $55 now is actually worth the same as about $44 in round 1 due to my higher inflation rate, while your $45 is worth about $40.5 in round 1 terms. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both reason to settle now.",Alice,3,
