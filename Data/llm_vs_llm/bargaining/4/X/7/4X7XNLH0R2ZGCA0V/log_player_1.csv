"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer to Bob that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, it's better for both of us to make a deal now rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my first-mover position.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation penalty we both face.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure if I'll accept a lower share in the next round. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I understand we both face inflation penalties, but mine is more severe at 20% per round while yours is only 10%. My $55 now is actually worth the same as about $44 in round 1 due to my higher inflation rate, while your $45 is worth about $40.5 in round 1 terms. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both reason to settle now.""}"
