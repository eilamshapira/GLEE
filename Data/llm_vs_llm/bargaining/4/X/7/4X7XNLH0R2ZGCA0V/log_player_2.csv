"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, it's better for both of us to make a deal now rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my first-mover position. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hey Alice, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation penalty we both face.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure if I'll accept a lower share in the next round. Let's make a deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I understand we both face inflation penalties, but mine is more severe at 20% per round while yours is only 10%. My $55 now is actually worth the same as about $44 in round 1 due to my higher inflation rate, while your $45 is worth about $40.5 in round 1 terms. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both reason to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
