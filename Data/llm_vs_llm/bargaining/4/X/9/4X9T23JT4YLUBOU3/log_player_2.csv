"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the negotiation power we both have.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the risk I'm taking by letting the money devalue further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation risk you mentioned. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
