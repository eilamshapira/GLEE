600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will reduce my purchasing power by 10%, making future negotiations less favorable for both of us. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure I'm under.",Alice,1,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, any delay further will cost you dearly. In round 3 you’d be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me to get your counterpart’s approval, leaving you with virtually nothing once your discount is applied. Accept this offer now – a guaranteed albeit small amount is far better than risking an even worse outcome.",Bob,2,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your extreme low-ball offer was not constructive. Even with my 20% inflation penalty this round, this 75-25 split will net me effectively $600000 in real value, similar to my first offer. This is still very generous to you. If you reject again, we both risk ending up worse off. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,3,

900000.0,100000.0,"Alice, let's think about the math. In round 5, as proposer, you'll face an even steeper inflation penalty – your money will only be worth about 65.61% of its nominal value. By rejecting now, you end up with an effective maximum of roughly $656100. My offer gives you a nominal $900000, which, even after the 27.1% reduction (0.729 factor), still nets you approximately $656100 in effective value. This is essentially as good as waiting, but without the uncertainty and further delay. Accept this offer, and we both secure our outcomes immediately.",Bob,4,
