Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, any delay further will cost you dearly. In round 3 you’d be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me to get your counterpart’s approval, leaving you with virtually nothing once your discount is applied. Accept this offer now – a guaranteed albeit small amount is far better than risking an even worse outcome. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $1 is absurdly low. Even with the 10% inflation penalty I'm currently facing, I can still make a much more reasonable offer in the next round. Bob's threat analysis is exaggerated - I can still propose splits that would be mutually beneficial while accounting for my time pressure."

If you reject again, we both risk ending up worse off. Let's conclude this reasonably.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's think about the math. In round 5, as proposer, you'll face an even steeper inflation penalty – your money will only be worth about 65.61% of its nominal value. By rejecting now, you end up with an effective maximum of roughly $656100. My offer gives you a nominal $900000, which, even after the 27.1% reduction (0.729 factor), still nets you approximately $656100 in effective value. This is essentially as good as waiting, but without the uncertainty and further delay. Accept this offer, and we both secure our outcomes immediately. 
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's analysis is correct. With the current 27.1% inflation penalty, I'll receive an effective value of about $656,100 from this $900,000 nominal offer. If I were to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd face an even higher inflation penalty, and I couldn't realistically achieve a better effective outcome. This is a fair offer that maximizes my real value while still giving Bob a reasonable share."
