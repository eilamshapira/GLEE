"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 out of the $100, while she gets $60. 

While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. I need to consider that:
1) If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
2) There's no inflation for me, so my $40 would be worth the same now or later
3) I don't know if Alice faces inflation, which might give me leverage in negotiation
4) We only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

I think I can negotiate for a more favorable split, so I'll reject this offer and make my counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a split where I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is slightly favoring me, but much closer to an even split than Alice's initial offer. Since there's no inflation for me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a better deal, but I also don't want to be too aggressive and risk prolonged negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has now moved from her initial offer of 40/60 to a more balanced 45/55 split. This is progress in my favor. I also see that she's facing significant inflation - her money is worth 36% less than in the first round, which explains why she might be more willing to compromise.

Given that:
1) Alice has improved her offer in my favor
2) She's facing substantial inflation (36%), giving me leverage
3) I face no inflation, so my $45 is worth the same regardless of when we settle
4) We still have several rounds left, but need to be mindful of the 12-round limit

I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal. Since Alice is facing inflation pressure and has already moved significantly from her initial position, I'll reject this offer to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split or better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is facing significant inflation (36% already by round 3) and I'm not affected by inflation, I have a stronger negotiating position. Alice has already moved from 40/60 to 45/55, showing she's willing to compromise. I'll push for a slightly more favorable split for me.

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}

I propose that I receive $58 and Alice receives $42. This reflects my stronger negotiating position due to her inflation concerns, while still offering an amount that would be reasonable for her to accept given the circumstances. The longer we negotiate, the more her potential gain loses value, which should encourage her to accept a somewhat less favorable split now rather than risk further devaluation."
