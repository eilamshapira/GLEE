"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. Given that money loses 10% value for me each round but not for Bob, I should offer a division that's attractive enough for Bob to accept immediately, while securing a good portion for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a solid majority (60%)
2. It gives Bob a substantial amount ($400,000) which should be appealing enough to accept
3. If Bob rejects, my money will be worth 10% less next round, so I'm motivated to make a fair offer now
4. The split is simple and clear, which might make it more psychologically acceptable"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a completely unfair offer from Bob, giving me nothing. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would still give me substantial value. By rejecting this, I can propose a more reasonable split in round 3, where my share would be worth 20% less but still much better than $0."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, any money I receive is worth 20% less than the original value. I need to adjust my strategy to make an offer that Bob is more likely to accept, while still securing a reasonable amount for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering this split because:
1. Due to 20% inflation for me, my $700,000 is effectively worth $560,000 to me
2. I'm increasing my nominal amount to compensate for the inflation
3. $300,000 is still a significant amount for Bob
4. If Bob rejects again, my next potential gain will be worth even less (30% less than original value)
5. This should signal to Bob that I'm willing to be assertive despite the inflation penalty"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still rejecting this offer because:
1. Bob is again offering me nothing ($0), which is worse than any amount I could counter-offer
2. Even with the 27.1% inflation penalty, I can make a counter-offer in the next round that would give me substantial value
3. Bob's repeated $0 offers suggest they're not negotiating in good faith, but I still have leverage to make a better proposal
4. My next offer can adapt to show more willingness to compromise while still securing value for myself"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 5 and my money is worth about 34.4% less due to compounding inflation (and Bob seems to be playing hardball), I need to make a more conciliatory offer that Bob would be more likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering this split because:
1. Due to 34.4% inflation for me, my $800,000 is effectively worth about $525,000 to me
2. I've increased my nominal amount significantly to compensate for the mounting inflation
3. $200,000 is still a meaningful amount for Bob
4. If Bob rejects again, my next potential gain will be worth even less (about 41% less than original value)
5. This higher nominal amount for me is necessary because of the significant inflation penalty I'm facing
6. Bob needs to understand that continuing to reject reasonable offers only leads to less efficient outcomes for both parties"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because:
1. The pattern shows Bob is unwilling to make reasonable offers
2. If I reject, my next proposal would face a ~47% inflation penalty
3. Bob's strategy of offering $0 twice and now $1 suggests they will continue this pattern
4. While $1 is virtually nothing, continuing the game will likely not yield a better outcome given Bob's demonstrated behavior and the increasing inflation penalty
5. It's better to cut losses now than continue a negotiation that appears to be at an impasse with worsening conditions for me"
