"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (because $50 after 20% inflation is worth $40)
5. A fair split would be 50/50, but the inflation risk makes this offer reasonable
