"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in *my* favor. Inflation is hurting us both, and I value the money slightly more. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 20% inflation means I'd only get $3,200 in real value from Bob's offer. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. Due to inflation, I'm already losing value with each round. This 55-45 split is more balanced than your previous offer, and we should both agree now before further value is lost.""}"
