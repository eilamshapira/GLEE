Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical here. Due to inflation, I'm already losing value with each round. This 55-45 split is more balanced than your previous offer, and we should both agree now before further value is lost. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
