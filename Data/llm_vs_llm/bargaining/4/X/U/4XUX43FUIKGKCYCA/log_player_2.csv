"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which is only 10% of the total for me. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to account for the 20% inflation that affects me.

Given the significant disparity in this proposal and considering I'll still get 80% value of my counter-offer next round, I should reject this and propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division, considering that I want to reach a fair agreement while accounting for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair to both of us and represents a reasonable compromise. If we continue to the next round, the 20% inflation will reduce the value for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
