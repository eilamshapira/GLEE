"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $235716 and you take $764284. If you wait, your expected gain remains around $764284 when you get to propose in round 2 â€“ but with further delays, we both lose more value to inflation. Let's agree now and avoid those losses! 
# Bob gain: 764284 
# Alice gain: 235716 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $764,284 (76.4%) and taking $235,716 (23.6%)
2. This is actually a very generous offer - in most ultimatum games, splits are closer to 60/40
3. Alice makes a valid point about inflation:
   * If I reject, we move to round 2 where the total value is reduced by 5%
   * The $1M would become $950,000 in round 2
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split then, the absolute amount might be less

Given that:
1. The offer is already quite favorable to me
2. Waiting would subject the total amount to 5% inflation
3. There's no guarantee I could get a significantly better deal in later rounds
4. Alice is showing good faith with a reasonable first offer
