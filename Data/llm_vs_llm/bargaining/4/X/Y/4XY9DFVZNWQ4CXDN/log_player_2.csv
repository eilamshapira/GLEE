"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very unequal division where Alice would get 95% of the money while I would only get 5%. Given that the money loses 10% of its value for me each round, I should consider that factor, but this offer is still quite low.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be 900,000$ (10% less), but I could propose a much more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division while accounting for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split, which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we each receive half of the total amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $375,000, which with the 19% inflation means it's worth about $303,750 in original value to me. This is significantly better than her initial offer of just $50,000.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face 29% inflation (another 10% loss), meaning any amount would be worth even less to me. 

While this split isn't equal (37.5% for me, 62.5% for Alice), given the asymmetric inflation affecting us differently, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
