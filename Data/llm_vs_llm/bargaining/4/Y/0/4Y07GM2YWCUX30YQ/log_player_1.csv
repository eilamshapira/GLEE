"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 42.02, ""bob_gain"": 57.98, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my offer for round 1. Taking into account that any delay hurts you more (a 10% loss per round for you versus my 5%), I propose we settle now: I get $42.02 and you get $57.98 out of the $100. This division reflects the fair continuation values we’d both expect if we prolonged the negotiation. I hope you agree that avoiding further delay – and the inevitable inflation loss – is in both our interests!""}"
