"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my offer for round 1. Taking into account that any delay hurts you more (a 10% loss per round for you versus my 5%), I propose we settle now: I get $42.02 and you get $57.98 out of the $100. This division reflects the fair continuation values we’d both expect if we prolonged the negotiation. I hope you agree that avoiding further delay – and the inevitable inflation loss – is in both our interests! 
# Bob gain: 57.98 
# Alice gain: 42.02 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

In the first round, the total amount of money is $100. Alice proposes that she gets $42.02 and I get $57.98. This seems like a reasonable offer, considering that I lose 10% of the value per round, while Alice loses 5%.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, which means I'll be negotiating over $90 (100 - 10% of 100). For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less, so she'll be negotiating over $95 (100 - 5% of 100).

Considering the potential losses, I think it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer, as it gives me a significant amount of money upfront and avoids further losses due to inflation.
