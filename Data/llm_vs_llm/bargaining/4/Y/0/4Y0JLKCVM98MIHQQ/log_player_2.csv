Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems reasonable on the surface, the inflation factor is crucial.  I need to push for a higher gain in the earlier rounds to offset the inflation's effect on my potential winnings."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly. While not ideal, accepting 60% now is better than risking getting a much lower amount later or even nothing at all if we fail to agree."
