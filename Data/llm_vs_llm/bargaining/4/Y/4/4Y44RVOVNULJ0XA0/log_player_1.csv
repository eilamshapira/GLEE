Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more fair split considering the risk of inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, it seems like Bob is pretty insistent on getting more. Inflation is hitting us both, so I need to factor that in. My money is now worth 10% less than in round 1 and will continue to decrease. Bob's money is worth 5% less than in round 1 and will continue to decrease. I'll try to make an offer that is somewhat reasonable, considering that I was already offering a good deal in the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering you 4500, which is more than my original offer to you after considering inflation. I'm still taking on slightly more of the loss from inflation. Let's end this now.""
}
