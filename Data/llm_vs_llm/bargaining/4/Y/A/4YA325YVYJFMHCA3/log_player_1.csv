"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a standard alternating‐offers analysis (adapted from Rubinstein’s bargaining model) where your discount factor is 0.95 per round and Bob’s is 0.80 per round, the equilibrium division when you’re the proposer (round 1) is approximately as follows:

• Alice’s equilibrium share: (1 – 0.8) / (1 – 0.95×0.8) ≈ 0.20 / 0.24 ≈ 83.33% of the pie  
• Bob’s equilibrium share: 100% − 83.33% ≈ 16.67% of the pie

Applied to $10,000, this means:
 Alice: about $8,333  
 Bob: about $1,667  

This division is optimal from your perspective because if Bob rejects your offer, he’ll get the right to propose in round 2—but his severe 20% discount factor means his “threat” payoff is much lower in present‐value terms.

Here is the JSON offer for Round 1:
