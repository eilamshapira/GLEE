Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the depreciation of the money and wanting to secure a reasonable amount for myself, I'll propose the following:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""alice_gain"": 3500
}
```

This offer gives me a larger portion, but still leaves Alice with a significant amount."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time is really running out due to inflation. I need to make a decision that reflects the decreasing value of the money and the increasing risk of getting nothing. I still want a decent portion, but I need to make it more appealing for Alice to accept.
