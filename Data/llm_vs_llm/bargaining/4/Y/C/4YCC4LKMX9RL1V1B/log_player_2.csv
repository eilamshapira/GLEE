"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split is fair, I should consider the complete picture before deciding.

Since inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation), there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating. However, I don't know if Alice faces inflation pressure that might make her more willing to accept a better offer from me in the next round.

I'll try to negotiate for a slightly better deal since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I suggest a 55-45 split that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money. Since there's no inflation pressure on me, I can negotiate with confidence, but I also want to be fair enough that Alice would accept rather than continuing further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now offering me $5250 (52.5%) while keeping $4750 (47.5%) for herself. This is an improvement from the initial 50-50 split and not far from my previous offer of 55-45. 

I also observe that Alice is experiencing inflation (9.75% less value for her since round 1), which explains why she might be more willing to compromise. For me, there's still no inflation effect.

While I could reject and try to get an even better deal next round, Alice's offer is reasonable, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in later rounds or us failing to reach an agreement within the 12-round limit.
