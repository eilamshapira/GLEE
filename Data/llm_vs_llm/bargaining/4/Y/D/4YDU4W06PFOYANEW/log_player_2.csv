"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100.0 
# Alice gain: 0.0 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me the entire $100, which is obviously favorable to me. However, it gives Alice nothing, which seems unfair. Given the inflation penalty with each round, accepting now would maximize my gain, but I should consider whether Alice will really accept getting nothing.
