"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, keeping in mind that we should both aim to reach an agreement quickly due to the 20% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us each $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
