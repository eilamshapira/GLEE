"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. It's fair! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an equal 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. At first glance, this seems fair.

However, I need to account for the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the best I could reasonably hope for might be around 60% ($600,000), but after the 10% inflation, that would be equivalent to $540,000 in current value. This is only slightly better than the $500,000 being offered now, and comes with the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer.

Given the guaranteed $500,000 now versus the uncertain and inflation-affected outcome of future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
