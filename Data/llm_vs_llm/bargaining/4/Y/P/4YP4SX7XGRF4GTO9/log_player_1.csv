"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more balanced 55-45 split for me. This reflects the risk I'm taking rejecting your first offer and facing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- If I accept now, I get $450,000 worth 90% = $405,000 real value
- If I make a counter-offer, I risk another 10% inflation but can propose a better split
- Bob seems willing to negotiate, and the difference between our positions isn't too large
- I'll try another round with a more balanced offer, but need to act quickly before inflation erodes too much value"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. Time is critical due to inflation affecting both of us, and this is a fair compromise from both our previous positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting us both. Let's try 52-48 for me. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- My share of $480,000 is worth 72.9% of its original value = $349,920 real value
- If I reject, my next round would be worth even less (37.1% inflation)
- Bob has moved significantly from his original position
- The difference is now relatively small and not worth the inflation risk
- Further negotiation would likely result in less real value for me due to compounding inflation"
