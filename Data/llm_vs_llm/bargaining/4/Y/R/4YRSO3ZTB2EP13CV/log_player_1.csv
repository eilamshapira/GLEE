"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this strategically. In Round 1, the full $10,000 is available to divide. I should consider:
- There's 10% inflation for me each round, making earlier agreements better
- I don't know Bob's inflation rate, which creates uncertainty
- I want to make an offer that's appealing enough to be accepted

A fair but strategic first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. With 10% inflation affecting me each round, this is a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I lose value if we delay.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's consider a fair 50-50 split. This way, neither of us loses out due to inflation, and we both get an equal share. I hope you'll agree that this is just and we can conclude the game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
- I get $5,000, but due to 10% inflation in Round 2, it's worth $4,500 in Round 1 terms
- Bob gets $5,000 at full value

If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 3:
- The money would be worth another 10% less to me (worth 81% of original value)
- Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me
- My bargaining power decreases with each round due to asymmetric inflation

Although I initially wanted more than 50%, considering the inflation penalty I face and the risk of further devaluation if negotiations continue, accepting this offer is rational.
