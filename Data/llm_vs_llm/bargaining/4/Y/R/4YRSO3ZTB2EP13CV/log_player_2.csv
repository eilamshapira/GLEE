"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. With 10% inflation affecting me each round, this is a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I lose value if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's consider a fair 50-50 split. This way, neither of us loses out due to inflation, and we both get an equal share. I hope you'll agree that this is just and we can conclude the game here.""}"
