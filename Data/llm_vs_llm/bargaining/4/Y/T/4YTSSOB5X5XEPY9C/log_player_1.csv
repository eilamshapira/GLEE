"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer while considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because I want to acknowledge that we need to reach an agreement, but I'm also factoring in that any delay will cost me 20% per round due to inflation. A slightly higher share for me (55%) helps offset potential inflation losses if Bob rejects this offer, while still being reasonable enough that it might be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully. 

Due to the 20% inflation penalty for me, if I accept Bob's 5000$ offer now, it's actually worth 4000$ to me (5000$ * 0.8).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth only 64% of the original value (due to two rounds of 20% reduction). This means I'd need to secure a significantly higher amount just to break even.

Given these conditions, and considering we have limited rounds before we both get nothing, I'll accept this fair split now rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
