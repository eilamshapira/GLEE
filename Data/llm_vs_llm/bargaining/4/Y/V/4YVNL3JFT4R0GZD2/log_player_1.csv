"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a fair offer while considering the 20% inflation per round. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I should propose a reasonable split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than going to the next round where inflation would reduce the value for me."
