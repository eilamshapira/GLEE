"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm offered $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $45 now is better than $47.25 in the next round (due to 5% inflation)
5. The split is relatively fair (45-55)

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty, this is a reasonable offer. While not perfectly equal, the difference isn't large enough to risk losing value through inflation.
