"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the money, which would give me $500,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation factor that affects only my earnings.

Since money is worth 10% less to me each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I would need more than $500,000 to match the current value. However, Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be incentivized to drag this out.

Given that we're in the first round and I'm being offered exactly half, which is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
