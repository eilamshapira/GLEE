"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider this offer carefully, taking into account the 10% inflation penalty for each round and the fact that we have limited rounds.

Alice is offering a perfect 50-50 split in the first round, giving me $5,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I'll already be dealing with 10% inflation, meaning my money would be worth less. Even if I tried to get more in the next round, the inflation effect would partially offset any gains.

Given the fair nature of this first offer and the inflation risk, I'll accept.
