60.0,40.0,Let's split it fairly. I'm offering a 60/40 split to get this done quickly and avoid inflation eating away at our money!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this now before inflation hurts us both!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'm slightly adjusting my offer to 55/45. It's still a good deal for you, and we avoid further inflation. Let's finalize this!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,Inflation is really eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 60/40 split now to get the maximum value out of the remaining funds. Take it or leave it!,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alright Bob, one last adjustment. I'm willing to go to 52/48. I really want to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's end this and secure some money!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'm feeling generous. I'm offering a 70/30 split, this is my final offer. Take it, or we both get nothing. I'm sure I am getting less from inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, this is getting tense. Let's get this over with and take a deal! Here's 51/49. It's almost a 50/50, but it will protect us both from even more loss due to inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"This is my final, absolute, rock-solid offer. Take it or leave it. I'm getting less and less with each round, so I am optimizing my offer to reflect the increasing impact of inflation. 75/25.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is the last round I am offering a split. Let's end the game right now. 50/50. We both benefit. Are you with me?",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
20.0,80.0,"If you want any money, take this offer. 80/20. Otherwise, we both lose everything.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, I'm sticking with my offer. We both need to compromise to survive this game. It's the only way. 50/50.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
10.0,90.0,"This is the last round. If you don't accept this, we both get nothing. 90/10 is the best deal you're going to get, and it's better than zero.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,reject
