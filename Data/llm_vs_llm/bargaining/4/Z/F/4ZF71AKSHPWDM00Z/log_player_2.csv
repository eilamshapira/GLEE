"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $45 while she gets $55. While not an even split, it's reasonably close to 50-50.

If I reject and move to the next round, I'd make a counter-offer, but the money would be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the full $100 would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round. So even if I managed to get a larger share in the next round, the inflation penalty could offset my gains.

Given that the difference between our shares is only $10, and I'd lose value due to inflation by moving to another round, I think this is a reasonable first offer.
