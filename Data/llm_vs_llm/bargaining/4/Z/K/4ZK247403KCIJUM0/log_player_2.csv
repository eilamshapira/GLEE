"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair. However, with the 5% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will already be reduced to 95$.

Even if I were to get a larger share in later rounds, the decreasing value due to inflation would likely result in less actual value for me. A guaranteed $50 now is better than an uncertain higher percentage of a diminishing total.

Therefore, I'll accept this fair offer in the first round to avoid the inflation penalty.
