"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a fair offer right from the start. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by accepting now, and waiting risks potentially worse offers in future rounds.
