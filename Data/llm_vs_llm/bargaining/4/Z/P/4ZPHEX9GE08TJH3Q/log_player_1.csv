"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us substantial amounts. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round, it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. I've moved toward a more balanced split from my initial offer. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round, $450,000 now is worth more to him than an even larger amount in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise."
