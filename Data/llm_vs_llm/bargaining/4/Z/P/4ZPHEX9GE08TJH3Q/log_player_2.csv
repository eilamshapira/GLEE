"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice's initial offer gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. Given that inflation reduces my money's value by 10% each round, I need to consider whether I might get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer, or if I should accept this first offer.

With 10% inflation per round, if I reject, my maximum potential value will decrease. However, I would get to make the next proposal, which gives me leverage.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that Alice might accept, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round and Alice doesn't, I'm offering myself a higher portion to compensate for this disadvantage. This division is more balanced when considering the inflation effect, and it gives Alice a substantial amount while acknowledging my disadvantage in the game mechanics. If we continue to future rounds, my buying power will decrease due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000, while taking $550,000 for herself. Given that inflation has already reduced my buying power by 19% since the first round, I need to carefully consider this offer.

If I reject this offer, inflation will continue to reduce the value of any future amount I receive. Additionally, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a more favorable offer to me in the next round. We're already in round 3 of 12, and continuing to negotiate could lead to diminishing returns for me due to the asymmetric inflation penalty.

The $450,000 with 19% inflation is still worth approximately $364,500 in original value to me, which is not far from the initial offer in effective value. Since Alice has moved in my direction, and further delays will only reduce my buying power more, I'll accept this offer.
