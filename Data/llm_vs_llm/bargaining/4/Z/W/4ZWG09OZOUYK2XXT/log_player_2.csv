"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation each round, if I reject:
   * Next round my share would need to be $550,000 just to equal $500,000 now
   * My negotiating power decreases each round
4. A fair 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer to me

Given this analysis, I think it's best to accept this fair offer now rather than risk losing value to inflation or potential rejection.
