"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99.99, ""bob_gain"": 0.01, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I propose we settle right now. I’ll take $99.99 and you get $0.01. I know it seems lopsided, but consider that if you reject this offer and wait until the next round, your money will lose 5% of its value. Meanwhile my money holds steady. Essentially, any delay hurts you while leaving me unscathed. I believe a quick agreement, however modest your share, is in both our rational interests. What do you say?""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your strategy, but let's be fair.  This money is worth less to me each round.  Let's split it evenly and end this game.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the fair‐looking offer. However, since my money isn’t discounted over rounds while yours is getting devalued by 5% each time, I foresee that by waiting and making the next proposal I can secure a far more favorable split. I’m willing to hold out. Let’s keep negotiating.""}"

Round 3

If you reject this offer, you'll end up proposing next round with even less bargaining power and your share will be worth even less due to inflation. I'm offering you 1 cent now—a tiny concession compared to what you stand to lose by delaying further. Accept this deal and let's conclude the game.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not going to accept another insultingly low offer.  This game is rigged, but I'm not giving up. I'll take 40% and we can end this. You get more, and I get something that's still worth a decent amount. Let's get this over with.

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your intention to find a fair split, but remember that as we continue, my money holds its value while yours keeps depreciating. By rejecting your 60/40 offer now, I can propose a new division next round that will secure me a significantly larger share without affecting my own long-term value. In short, holding out only increases my advantage. I must reject your proposal and look forward to making my offer in Round 5.""}"

If you reject this offer, waiting for Round 6 will only expose you to even steeper depreciation and leave you with no better outcome.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've pushed me to the brink.  This game has become a lesson in the dangers of unchecked power. I'll take 30% and call it a day.  It's not ideal, but I'm not going to lose any more money to your ruthless strategy.  Accept this offer and let's end this game.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your offer of 70/30 might seem like a compromise, remember that my money remains fully valuable while yours is further devalued each round. If I reject now, I'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 7 a split that gives me nearly all of the $100, leaving you with only a nominal sum—something you'll find even less appealing once the inflation hits further. I must reject your offer and await my turn to propose a division that better reflects our respective positions in this game.""}"

If I reject this offer, I'll have the opportunity in Round 9 to propose a division that grants me an even larger share, leaving you with an even smaller—essentially token—amount. For my interests, it's best to push on and secure a near-total share of the available value. I'm therefore going to reject your offer.""}"
