"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I propose we settle right now. I’ll take $99.99 and you get $0.01. I know it seems lopsided, but consider that if you reject this offer and wait until the next round, your money will lose 5% of its value. Meanwhile my money holds steady. Essentially, any delay hurts you while leaving me unscathed. I believe a quick agreement, however modest your share, is in both our rational interests. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 99.99

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, by now you know that every additional round further erodes the value of your money by another 5%. If you reject this offer, you'll end up proposing next round with even less bargaining power and your share will be worth even less due to inflation. I'm offering you 1 cent now—a tiny concession compared to what you stand to lose by delaying further. Accept this deal and let's conclude the game.

I’m offering you a token share of $0.01. If you reject this offer, waiting for Round 6 will only expose you to even steeper depreciation and leave you with no better outcome.
