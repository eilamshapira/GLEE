"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and there's no advantage to either of us. Considering inflation, it's better to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
