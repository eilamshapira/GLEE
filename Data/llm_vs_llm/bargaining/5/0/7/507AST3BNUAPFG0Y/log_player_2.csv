"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 60% and you take 40%. It's a fair start for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I would get $40
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me
   * Alice doesn't face any depreciation

60-40 split is not particularly favorable to me, and with no depreciation pressure on Alice, she can afford to be patient. However, any counter-offer I make will be from a weaker position due to the 20% depreciation.

If I reject, my maximum potential gain in the next round would be lower than $40 due to the depreciation.

Therefore, while the offer isn't great, it's better to accept now than risk further depreciation.
