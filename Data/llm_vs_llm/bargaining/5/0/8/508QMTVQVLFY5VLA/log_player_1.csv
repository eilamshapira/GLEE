"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while still being fair enough that Bob might accept, considering he doesn't know if inflation will affect him similarly in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable first offer that gives me a modest advantage while still being close enough to 50-50 to be potentially acceptable to Bob. If he rejects, the next round's value will be worth 10% less to me, so I have an incentive to make a fair first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $4500 is actually worth $4050 to me (4500 * 0.9)
   * Bob's $5500 remains worth $5500 to him

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   * The entire amount will be worth another 10% less to me
   * I'm not sure about Bob's inflation rate
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

3. This offer gives me less than my initial proposal, but waiting will cost me more due to inflation.

Given that inflation is certainly hurting my position and further delays will only make it worse, I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
