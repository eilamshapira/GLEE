"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains but need to reach an agreement. Since Bob has a higher inflation penalty (10% vs my 5%), he might be more inclined to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It acknowledges Bob's need to decide quickly due to his higher inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This split is too unfavorable for me. Even with the inflation penalty, I can still try to get a better deal in the next round. Since my inflation penalty (5%) is lower than Bob's (10%), I can afford to be a bit more patient in negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob tried to claim a larger share, I'll adjust my offer slightly but still keep it reasonable, considering we both face increasing inflation penalties (I'm now at 10% cumulative loss, Bob at 20%).

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

This is a more balanced offer that gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal, showing I'm willing to compromise. Given Bob's higher inflation penalty, this should be more attractive to him than continuing further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because it's even more unfavorable than Bob's previous offer. Even with increasing inflation, getting 35% of the pot is too low. Since my inflation rate (5% per round) is still lower than Bob's (10% per round), I can afford to continue negotiating. Bob should be feeling more pressure to reach an agreement due to his higher inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob has consistently pushed for a larger share despite facing higher inflation penalties, I need to adjust my strategy. At this point, Bob's facing about 34% inflation while I'm at about 19% inflation. I'll make a more compromising offer to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

This offer gives Bob a slight majority while still being fair to me. Given Bob's mounting inflation penalty, this should be more attractive than continuing the negotiation further. It's a significant concession from my initial position, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
