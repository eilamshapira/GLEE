"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing an equal split of $50 each
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the total pot would be worth $80 in the next round
4. $50 now is better than potentially getting even $60 of depreciated money in the next round

This is a fair opening offer and the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject. I'll accept.
