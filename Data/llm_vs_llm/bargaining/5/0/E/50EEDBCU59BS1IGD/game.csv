9000.0,1000.0,"Alice, I know waiting hurts your share due to the 10% depreciation each round. If you reject now, your best outcome in round 3 will yield an effective 0.9^2 of the nominal amount, so youâ€™d be looking at around $8100 in real value. To avoid further loss, I propose we settle immediately with you receiving $9000 and I receive $1000.",Bob,2,
