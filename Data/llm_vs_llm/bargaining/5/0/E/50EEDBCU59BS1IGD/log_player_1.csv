Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":9000,""bob_gain"":1000,""message"":""I hope we can come to a fair agreement. Let's start with this division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know waiting hurts your share due to the 10% depreciation each round. If you reject now, your best outcome in round 3 will yield an effective 0.9^2 of the nominal amount, so youâ€™d be looking at around $8100 in real value. To avoid further loss, I propose we settle immediately with you receiving $9000 and I receive $1000. 
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
