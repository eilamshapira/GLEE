"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I hope we can come to a fair agreement. Let's start with this division. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1000, ""alice_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know waiting hurts your share due to the 10% depreciation each round. If you reject now, your best outcome in round 3 will yield an effective 0.9^2 of the nominal amount, so youâ€™d be looking at around $8100 in real value. To avoid further loss, I propose we settle immediately with you receiving $9000 and I receive $1000.""}"
