"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you a substantial 450k, which is close to half. If we delay, we both lose money due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it equal and straightforward. We both take an equal share of 500k each. This way, we both win and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is completely fair, and with the 20% inflation already affecting this round, it's better to accept now rather than risk further devaluation of the money in future rounds. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution, and I'm happy to accept it."
