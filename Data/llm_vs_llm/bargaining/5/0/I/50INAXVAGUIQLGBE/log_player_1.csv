"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I’m proposing a split of $99 for me and $1 for you. Accepting now gives you $1 at full value, whereas waiting only exposes you to a 10% discount each round, leaving you with nothing in any future equilibrium. Let’s settle now for an efficient outcome!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally. We both walk away with a fair share of $50 each. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob – Your equal split proposal gives me $50 at full value, which is very attractive compared to the uncertain future rounds. I appreciate the fairness of your offer, so I'm ready to accept it.""}"
