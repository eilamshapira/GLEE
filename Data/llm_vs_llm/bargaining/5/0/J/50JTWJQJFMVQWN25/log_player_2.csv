"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice is affected by 10% inflation per round and I'm not, I have an advantage by waiting. If Alice gets $500,000 in the next round, it will only be worth $450,000 to her, while my money maintains its value.

I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even though this is a fair 50-50 split, the inflation factor means I should reject this and propose a split more in my favor next time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I know Alice faces 10% inflation per round and we have 10 rounds left after this, I should propose a split that's more favorable to me but still attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than wait (since waiting costs her money).

If Alice rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth 10% less. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which should be more attractive to her than waiting and losing value.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because it gives Alice a significant portion while taking advantage of my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $550,000 (a 55-45 split)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can propose again
   - Alice's money will be worth 29% less than the first round
   - My money keeps its full value
3. We still have 9 rounds left

Given that Alice's negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation, and she's only offering me 55%, I believe I can get a better deal by waiting. The inflation pressure on Alice means she should be willing to offer me more in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now experiencing 29% inflation, and has rejected my previous 60-40 split, I need to propose something that:
1. Takes advantage of my stronger position (I don't face inflation)
2. Is still attractive enough for Alice to accept (as her money will be worth even less next round)
3. Is better than my previous offer which was rejected

I'll propose a 65-35 split, which gives me a better deal while still leaving Alice with a significant amount that's worth more to her now than what she might get in future rounds due to increasing inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

This offer is rational for Alice to accept because if she waits another round, her share will be worth even less due to 39% inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $600,000 (a 60-40 split)
2. Current situation:
   - Alice's money is worth 34.39% less
   - My money keeps full value
3. If I reject:
   - Next round Alice's money will be worth ~44% less
   - I can propose again
   - We still have 7 rounds left

While this is a better offer than before (60-40), Alice's rapidly deteriorating position due to inflation suggests I can get an even better deal by waiting. The significant inflation impact means she should be increasingly willing to offer me more to avoid further value loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice's money is now worth ~44% less than the initial value
2. She rejected my previous 65-35 split
3. She just offered me a 60-40 split
4. Her position continues to weaken with each round
5. However, we're now halfway through our rounds

I'll propose a 70-30 split. This is more aggressive than my previous offer because:
- Alice's money is losing value quickly
- She needs to make a deal soon to avoid even more severe inflation
- My position remains strong as I don't face inflation

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This offer, while heavily in my favor, might be rational for Alice to accept because waiting another round would mean her share would be worth even less due to ~54% inflation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $650,000 (a 65-35 split)
2. Current situation:
   - Alice's money is worth 46.86% less
   - We have 5 rounds left after this
   - Her money will be worth ~57% less next round

While this is a better offer than before (65-35), I still have a strong advantage:
- Alice's money continues to lose value rapidly
- My money maintains its value
- We still have several rounds left
- She has been steadily increasing her offers

Given that Alice's position continues to weaken significantly with each round, and she's shown willingness to increase her offers, I believe I can get an even better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Current analysis:
1. Alice's money is now worth ~57% less than initial value
2. She's shown willingness to increase offers (last offered 65-35)
3. She rejected my previous 70-30 split
4. We have 4 rounds left after this
5. Next round her money will be worth ~67% less

Given the severe inflation impact and limited remaining rounds, I'll propose a 75-25 split. While this is aggressive, it's rational because:
- $250,000 now is worth more to Alice than $350,000 would be in 2 rounds
- The remaining rounds give her less negotiating power
- She's demonstrated a pattern of increasing offers
- Time pressure is building with only 4 rounds left

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

This offer balances my strong position with the need to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds and both get nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze carefully:

1. Alice is offering a 70-30 split ($700,000 for me)
2. Current situation:
   - Alice's money is worth 56.95% less
   - Only 3 rounds left after this
   - Her money will be worth ~67% less next round
3. Recent history:
   - Her offers have been steadily increasing
   - We're getting closer to the deadline
   - Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree

While I believe I could potentially get a slightly better deal, the risks are increasing:
- Limited rounds remaining
- Risk of both getting nothing if we don't reach agreement
- Alice has shown significant movement in my direction
- The offer is already quite favorable to me (70-30)

Given these factors, especially the limited remaining rounds and the already favorable split, I'll accept this offer.
