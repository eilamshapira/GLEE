550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly, recognizing that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). This gives us both significant value while accounting for our different time preferences. If we delay, both of us lose value - you more than me - so this is a fair first offer.",Alice,1,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, we both lose with delays. I propose a 52/48 split in your favor. This recognizes your lower inflation rate while still offering me a reasonable share.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
