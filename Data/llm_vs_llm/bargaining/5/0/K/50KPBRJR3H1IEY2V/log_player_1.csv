"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a proposal that considers the different inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly, recognizing that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). This gives us both significant value while accounting for our different time preferences. If we delay, both of us lose value - you more than me - so this is a fair first offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, we both lose with delays. I propose a 52/48 split in your favor. This recognizes your lower inflation rate while still offering me a reasonable share.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
