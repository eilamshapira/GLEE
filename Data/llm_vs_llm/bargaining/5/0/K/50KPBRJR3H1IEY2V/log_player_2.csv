"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly, recognizing that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). This gives us both significant value while accounting for our different time preferences. If we delay, both of us lose value - you more than me - so this is a fair first offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, we both lose with delays. I propose a 52/48 split in your favor. This recognizes your lower inflation rate while still offering me a reasonable share.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
