"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer given the inflation penalty. If I reject, I'll propose in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me.

The current offer is a 50-50 split, which gives me $50. If I reject and move to the next round, even if I could get more (say 60-40 in my favor), the 10% inflation would mean 60% of the money would only be worth $54 to me (60 Ã— 0.9 = 54). That's not much better than taking $50 now.

Given the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer and further rounds would incur more inflation for me, accepting this fair split now seems reasonable.
