I'm trying to meet Bob closer to his desired range while still accounting for the fact that the value decreases more for him each round."

While Bob is moving closer to a more even split, the rate at which the money is losing value means I need to hold out for a better offer for a little while longer."

I'm matching his previous offer. It's getting risky to hold out much longer.  This way, he gets a decent amount, and it doesn't hurt me too much with the inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

This is cutting it close, but given the rate of inflation and the shrinking pot, it's better to accept now than risk getting even less in later rounds."
