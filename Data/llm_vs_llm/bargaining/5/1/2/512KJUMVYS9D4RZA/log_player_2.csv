"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would take $600,000. Since this is the first round, I need to consider that if I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the pot will effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject it, causing further inflation in round 3.

Let me think strategically. $400,000 is 40% of the pot, which isn't terrible. But I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the 10% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I've already experienced while giving Alice a fair portion.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and should be attractive to Alice, as she still receives a substantial amount. I've considered that the money is already worth 10% less to me, but a 50-50 split is equitable and has a good chance of being accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $450,000, which is better than her initial offer of $400,000 in round 1. However, I need to account for inflation.

With 19% inflation from round 1, my $450,000 is effectively worth about $364,500 of original value to me (450,000 Ã— 0.81).

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will be worth even less to me due to increasing inflation. Additionally, Alice seems to be negotiating toward a more equitable split compared to her first offer.

Given that my counter-offer was rejected, and the increasing inflation penalty I face, this improved offer from Alice makes sense to accept rather than risking further devaluation.
