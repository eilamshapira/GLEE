55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer given that you face a 5% devaluation per round. If we go to round 2, your $45 is worth only $42.75 to you. If you consider a 50/50 counterproposal in round 2, I would likely decline since I face no inflation, and by round 3, your money would be worth even less. This deal maximizes our joint utility.",Alice,1,
