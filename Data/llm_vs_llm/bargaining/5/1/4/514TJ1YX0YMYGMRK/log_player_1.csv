"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer given that you face a 5% devaluation per round. If we go to round 2, your $45 is worth only $42.75 to you. If you consider a 50/50 counterproposal in round 2, I would likely decline since I face no inflation, and by round 3, your money would be worth even less. This deal maximizes our joint utility.""}"
