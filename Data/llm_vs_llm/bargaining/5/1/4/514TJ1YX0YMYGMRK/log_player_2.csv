"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer given that you face a 5% devaluation per round. If we go to round 2, your $45 is worth only $42.75 to you. If you consider a 50/50 counterproposal in round 2, I would likely decline since I face no inflation, and by round 3, your money would be worth even less. This deal maximizes our joint utility. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept this offer, let's analyze the situation considering the inflation factor that affects me (Bob) but not Alice.

In Round 1, Alice offers a 55/45 split, which means I would get $45. Given the 5% devaluation per round for me, if I were to reject this offer and proceed to Round 2, any amount I would propose or counter-propose would indeed be worth 5% less to me. For instance, if I were to aim for a $50/$50 split in Round 2 (which is highly optimistic given Alice's stance), the $50 would be worth $47.50 to me due to the inflation (100% - 5% = 95% of the original value).

However, considering Alice's argument about joint utility maximization and the fact that she faces no inflation, it's clear she has a strategic advantage in negotiations as rounds progress. Her offer, while not equally split, does take into account the devaluation I face and presents a case where accepting early might be more beneficial to me than risking further devaluation.

Given these considerations, and acknowledging that Alice's offer, although not perfectly even, does provide a rationale for why immediate acceptance could be in my best interest due to the devaluation factor, I decide to:
