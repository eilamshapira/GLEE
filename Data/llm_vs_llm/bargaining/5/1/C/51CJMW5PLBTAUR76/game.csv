6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation and the limited number of rounds, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I need to request a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5% inflation rate. A 65-35 split would help balance this significant disadvantage I face. Let's make a deal now before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, given the inflation rates and the rounds passing by, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This should help mitigate the effects of inflation for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. After 4 rounds, my inflation has reduced my purchasing power by nearly 50%, while yours only by about 14%. I need a 70-30 split to compensate for this severe disadvantage. Even with this split, due to our different inflation rates, we'd end up with more balanced real values. Please consider this carefully.",Alice,5,
