"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation and the limited number of rounds, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is significant for me (20% per round) and I need to secure a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes this into account more favorably."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to request a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5% inflation rate. A 65-35 split would help balance this significant disadvantage I face. Let's make a deal now before inflation erodes more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the inflation rates and the rounds passing by, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This should help mitigate the effects of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With my 20% per round inflation rate, the offered $4000 would be worth only about $2048 in original value (due to 48.8% inflation), while Bob's $6000 is worth about $5145 in original value (due to 14.26% inflation). This difference is too large, so I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. After 4 rounds, my inflation has reduced my purchasing power by nearly 50%, while yours only by about 14%. I need a 70-30 split to compensate for this severe disadvantage. Even with this split, due to our different inflation rates, we'd end up with more balanced real values. Please consider this carefully.""}"
