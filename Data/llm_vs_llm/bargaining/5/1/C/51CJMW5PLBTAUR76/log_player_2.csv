Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to request a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5% inflation rate. A 65-35 split would help balance this significant disadvantage I face. Let's make a deal now before inflation erodes more value.

# Alice gain: 6500

  ""alice_gain"": 4000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. After 4 rounds, my inflation has reduced my purchasing power by nearly 50%, while yours only by about 14%. I need a 70-30 split to compensate for this severe disadvantage. Even with this split, due to our different inflation rates, we'd end up with more balanced real values. Please consider this carefully. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
