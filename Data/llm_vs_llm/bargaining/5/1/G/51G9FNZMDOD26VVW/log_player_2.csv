"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means I'd get 40% while she gets 60%. 

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, inflation means the total value to me would be $900,000 (10% less). This means I could potentially get more than $400,000 even with a smaller percentage in the next round.

Given that we're only in round 1 of a possible 12 rounds, and considering the inflation effect, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll offer a more balanced split while accounting for the inflation effect we've already experienced.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us equal shares of the available funds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this carefully:

1) Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me.
2) I've learned that inflation affects me but not Alice - this is important information.
3) Due to inflation, my $450,000 is worth about 19% less than in round 1, so effectively worth around $364,500 in round 1 terms.
4) If we continue to the next round, the money will be worth even less to me due to inflation.
5) If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that Alice isn't affected by inflation and seems willing to gradually increase her offers, and considering that my negotiating position weakens with each round due to one-sided inflation, I should accept this improved offer.
