"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I propose a slightly better deal for me to offset that. I get $52, you get $48, which is reasonable considering the inflation penalty I'm dealing with. This way we can both walk away with a fair amount without further delays. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
