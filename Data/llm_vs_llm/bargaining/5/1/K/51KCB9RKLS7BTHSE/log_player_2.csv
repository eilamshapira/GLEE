"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I take 60% and you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer for dividing $100, where she's proposing I get $40 and she gets $60.

If I reject and move to the next round, I should consider that inflation will reduce the value by 5% for me. So if I were to get $50 in the next round, it would be worth $47.50 to me due to inflation.

Alice's current offer of $40 is less than an even split, but it's guaranteed. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but need to factor in the 5% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation factor while trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I propose a slightly better deal for me to offset that. I get $52, you get $48, which is reasonable considering the inflation penalty I'm dealing with. This way we can both walk away with a fair amount without further delays.""}"
