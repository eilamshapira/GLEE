"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since Bob's money devalues slower than mine, giving him an advantage in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, which is fair considering the different inflation rates we face. This gives you $450,000, Bob, which is a substantial sum, and we can avoid the value loss from additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

For me, $450,000 in round 2 is actually worth $360,000 (due to 20% inflation).
If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% less).

Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable considering:
1. The inflation rates are in his favor
2. Further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us
3. The split is close to 50-50
