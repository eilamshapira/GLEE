"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the 5% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $100. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, and since inflation will reduce the value with each round, it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement quickly."
