"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives a slight advantage to me while still being fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a balanced proposal where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. It's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair, but gives me a small advantage as the first mover."
