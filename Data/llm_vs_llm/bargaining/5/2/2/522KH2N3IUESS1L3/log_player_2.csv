"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. It's the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. The offer gives me 45% of the total amount ($4500)
3. While not a 50-50 split, it's fairly close
4. If I reject, my next offer will be worth 10% less to me
5. Multiple rejections could significantly reduce the final value
6. Getting $4500 now is better than risking getting less later due to inflation

Given these factors, this is a reasonable offer. While not perfect, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential future negotiations makes it worth accepting.
