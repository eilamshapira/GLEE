600000.0,400000.0,This is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on me. Let's end this quickly so we both get a good deal.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you more than me. However, since I'm not affected by inflation while you lose 20% value per round, we should reach an agreement quickly. This 60/40 split favors me slightly due to my stronger negotiating position, but still gives you substantial value. If you reject, your next round's money would be worth 20% less to you, making this offer more valuable than waiting.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. Even though inflation affects me more, this is a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer will ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 65/35 split that reflects our different positions in this negotiation. Due to the inflation asymmetry, you've already lost 36% of your money's value, and would lose nearly 50% if we go another round. This offer gives you $350000 now, which is more valuable than potentially getting more in a future round when inflation will have further reduced its worth to you. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances - time is more costly for you than for me.",Bob,4,
