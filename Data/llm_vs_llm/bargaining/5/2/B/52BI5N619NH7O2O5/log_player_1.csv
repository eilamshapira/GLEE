Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you more than me. However, since I'm not affected by inflation while you lose 20% value per round, we should reach an agreement quickly. This 60/40 split favors me slightly due to my stronger negotiating position, but still gives you substantial value. If you reject, your next round's money would be worth 20% less to you, making this offer more valuable than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 65/35 split that reflects our different positions in this negotiation. Due to the inflation asymmetry, you've already lost 36% of your money's value, and would lose nearly 50% if we go another round. This offer gives you $350000 now, which is more valuable than potentially getting more in a future round when inflation will have further reduced its worth to you. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances - time is more costly for you than for me. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
