"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on me. Let's end this quickly so we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account that inflation affects Alice more than me. For me, there's no inflation penalty, so $400,000 is worth $400,000. For Alice, each round reduces her money's value by 20%.

However, this is only round 1, and if I reject, I can make my own proposal next round. Since I have no inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a more favorable split.

The proposed split gives me 40% of the total, which seems below what would be optimal for me given our different inflation sensitivities.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for the inflation asymmetry but is still reasonable for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you more than me. However, since I'm not affected by inflation while you lose 20% value per round, we should reach an agreement quickly. This 60/40 split favors me slightly due to my stronger negotiating position, but still gives you substantial value. If you reject, your next round's money would be worth 20% less to you, making this offer more valuable than waiting.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Even though inflation affects me more, this is a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer will ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer considering our inflation differences:

For me: $500,000 is worth $500,000 (no inflation penalty)
For Alice: $500,000 is worth only $320,000 (36% less) in real value

If I reject and we go to round 4, I could offer something better for me, but Alice would face even steeper inflation (losing 20% more value). This means she has increasing pressure to accept my next offer, strengthening my position.

Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal, especially knowing that Alice faces mounting pressure with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 65/35 split that reflects our different positions in this negotiation. Due to the inflation asymmetry, you've already lost 36% of your money's value, and would lose nearly 50% if we go another round. This offer gives you $350,000 now, which is more valuable than potentially getting more in a future round when inflation will have further reduced its worth to you. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances - time is more costly for you than for me.""}"
