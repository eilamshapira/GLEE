"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is the fairest division. If you reject, remember that further rounds will reduce the total value due to inflation for both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
