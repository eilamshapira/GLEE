"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 out of $100, which means she gets $60. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning any amount would be worth less to me. However, I might be able to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation risk while seeking a more balanced division.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is the fairest division. If you reject, remember that further rounds will reduce the total value due to inflation for both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now.""}"
