"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the value of the money after inflation.

*   **My original value:** $100
*   **My effective value now:** $100 - (5% of $100) = $95

The offer is:

*   Alice gain: 50 (effectively $50)
*   Bob gain: 50 (effectively $50 * 90% = $45)

Comparing my gain, the offer has:

*   Alice gain: $50
*   My round 1 gain: $60

My answer is:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer in Round 3. Inflation has affected the value again.

*   **My original value:** $100
*   **My effective value now:** $100 - (5% of $100 * 2) = $90 (approximately)

I need to adjust my strategy. Knowing that Bob will also lose value, I will try to offer him a bit more than before.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
