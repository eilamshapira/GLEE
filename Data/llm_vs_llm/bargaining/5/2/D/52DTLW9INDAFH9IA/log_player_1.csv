"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable but advantageous offer, considering that Bob's money loses 20% value each round if he rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, his next round's $100 will only be worth $80 to him
3. It's better for Bob to take $40 now than potentially get less value later due to the 20% depreciation per round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. I know Bob's money is devaluing by 20% each round while mine isn't
2. His $50 offer is actually worth only $40 to him now due to the 20% depreciation
3. I can make a counter-offer next round and leverage the continuing depreciation of Bob's share
4. Since I have no depreciation, I can afford to be more patient with negotiations"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth even less (60% of original value in this round), I can push for a more favorable split while still making it attractive for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, $30 now is actually worth more than $50 in the next round (which would be worth only $24 to him due to depreciation)
2. The continuing 20% depreciation per round makes waiting costly for Bob
3. This is still a better deal for Bob than continuing to negotiate while his value keeps decreasing
4. My money maintains its value, so I can afford to be firm with this offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's $55 is only worth about $28.16 to him now (51.2% of original value)
2. My $45 would be full value since I don't face depreciation
3. Given Bob's significant depreciation, I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer
4. With each round, Bob's negotiating position weakens due to the 20% depreciation
5. We still have plenty of rounds left, and I have no depreciation pressure"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money is now worth only about 41% of its original value (after 4 rounds of 20% depreciation), I can make an even stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, $20 now is worth more than $55 in the next round (which would be worth only about $18 to him due to continued depreciation)
2. Bob's money has already lost nearly 60% of its value, making each future round increasingly costly for him
3. This offer still gives Bob some real value, while waiting would diminish his share even further
4. Since my money maintains its value, I can continue to negotiate from a position of strength
5. It's becoming increasingly rational for Bob to accept a smaller nominal amount now rather than wait for future rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's $58 is only worth about $19 to him now (32.77% of original value)
2. My negotiating position continues to strengthen as Bob's money rapidly loses value
3. Bob's situation is becoming increasingly desperate with each round as his share devalues
4. We still have 6 rounds left, and I face no depreciation pressure
5. I can make a counter-offer next round that will be even more compelling for Bob to accept given his severe depreciation"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money is now worth only about 26.2% of its original value (after 6 rounds of 20% depreciation), I'll make an even stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, $10 now is actually worth more than $58 in the next round (which would be worth only about $15.2 to him due to continued depreciation)
2. Bob's money has lost nearly 74% of its value, making future rounds extremely costly for him
3. We're more than halfway through the rounds, and Bob's position is severely weakened
4. Since my money keeps its full value, I can continue to negotiate from an extremely strong position
5. It's becoming irrational for Bob to reject even small nominal amounts now, given how little value future money holds for him"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's $60 is only worth about $12.58 to him now (20.97% of original value)
2. This is a worse offer for me than previous ones ($40), while Bob's money continues to rapidly depreciate
3. Bob's negotiating position is extremely weak now, with his money worth less than 21% of its original value
4. We still have 4 rounds left, and I face no depreciation pressure
5. I can make an even more favorable counter-offer next round, as Bob's share will be worth even less to him
6. It's becoming increasingly irrational for Bob to continue rejecting offers as his money approaches near-worthless levels"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth only about 16.8% of its original value (after 8 rounds of 20% depreciation), I'll make an extremely aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, $5 now is actually worth more than $60 in the next round (which would be worth only about $10 to him due to continued depreciation)
2. Bob's money has lost over 83% of its value, making future rounds nearly worthless for him
3. We only have 3 rounds left after this one, and Bob's position is extremely weak
4. My money maintains full value, so I can continue to push for a highly favorable split
5. The threat of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within the remaining rounds should make this small but immediate payment more attractive to Bob
6. It would be economically irrational for Bob to continue rejecting offers at this point, given the severe depreciation he faces"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's $62 is only worth about $8.32 to him now (13.42% of original value)
2. This is his worst offer yet for me ($38), while his money is worth less than 14% of its original value
3. We have only 2 rounds left, and Bob's position is extremely desperate
4. Bob's offer is becoming increasingly irrational - he's offering me less while his own share becomes nearly worthless
5. With just 2 rounds remaining and Bob's money continuing to depreciate severely, I can make an even more extreme offer next round
6. The threat of both of us getting nothing if we don't reach agreement in the final rounds should make Bob more reasonable in the next round"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth only about 10.7% of its original value and only one round remaining after this, I'll make an extremely aggressive final offer.

{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, $1 now is actually worth more than $62 in the next round (which would be worth only about $6.7 to him due to continued depreciation)
2. Bob's money has lost nearly 90% of its value
3. This is the second-to-last round - if we don't reach agreement in the next round, we both get nothing
4. My money maintains full value, and I'm in an extremely strong negotiating position
5. Bob faces a critical decision: accept $1 with real value now, or risk getting nothing if we fail to agree in the final round
6. Given the extreme depreciation and the risk of getting nothing, even this small amount should be preferable to Bob than continuing to negotiate"
