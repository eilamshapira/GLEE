Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

My proposal: Alice gets $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's consider the inflation. For me, the money is worth 40% less now (2 rounds * 20% per round). For Bob, it's worth 10% less (2 rounds * 5% per round).

To make a reasonable offer, I'll adjust my previous offer, keeping in mind our relative losses.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $650,000 and Bob gets $350,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this. My money is worth about half of what it was, and Bob's is worth about 86% of what it was. Bob is offering $425,000, which adjusted for my inflation is about $217,650 in original-round terms.
