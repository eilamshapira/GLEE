"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that there's a 5% inflation for me in each round, I'll propose an even split which is fair and should be appealing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a perfectly even split of the $10,000. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid any potential loss from continuing to later rounds."
