Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my desired share slightly to try and sway Alice before the inflation eats too much of the pot.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one."

Even though the inflation is hurting, a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome likely at this point.  It's better to take the guaranteed win than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
