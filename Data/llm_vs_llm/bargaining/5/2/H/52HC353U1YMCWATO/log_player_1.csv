"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it more fair. This way, we both get a good share, and we can finish the game early to avoid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll think about making a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own loss due to inflation.

In Round 3, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value for me, and 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value for Bob.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more in your favor, but still reasonable for me considering the inflation.""}"
