"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer, considering the inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because the money will lose value for me with each passing round. I believe this is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for the inflation risk I face if we continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
