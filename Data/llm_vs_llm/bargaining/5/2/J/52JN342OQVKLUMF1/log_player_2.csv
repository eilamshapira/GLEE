"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no cost to rejecting and making a counter-offer. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round when I make the proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 for me and $50 for you, Alice. This is a fair division that benefits both of us equally."
