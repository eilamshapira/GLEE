Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this equally at 50/50. This is fair and with your 20% inflation rate, it's better for you to accept now rather than continuing and losing value.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. With your 20% inflation per round versus my 5%, you're losing value much faster. This 45/55 split favors me slightly but saves you from losing more in future rounds. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth substantially less to you due to your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
