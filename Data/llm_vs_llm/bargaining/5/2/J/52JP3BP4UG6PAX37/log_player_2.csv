"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation effects.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me, so the $100 pot would effectively be worth $95 to me. If I propose a better split next round, I could potentially get more than the $40 currently offered.

However, with the steep 20% inflation for Alice, she has a stronger incentive to settle quickly. I can use this to negotiate a more favorable split if we continue.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressures on both of us, especially Alice's higher 20% inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split this equally at 50/50. This is fair and with your 20% inflation rate, it's better for you to accept now rather than continuing and losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair for both of us. Don't risk losing more value! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $42 out of $100, slightly better than her initial $40 offer. Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1, so this $42 is effectively worth about $37.91 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will increase further. Alice's inflation rate (20% per round) is much higher than mine (5% per round), which means she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement soon.

While $42 is less than the $50 I proposed, continuing to negotiate could result in both of us losing more value due to inflation. However, I think I can still get a better deal since Alice faces much steeper inflation.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. With your 20% inflation per round versus my 5%, you're losing value much faster. This 45/55 split favors me slightly but saves you from losing more in future rounds. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth substantially less to you due to your higher inflation rate.""}"
