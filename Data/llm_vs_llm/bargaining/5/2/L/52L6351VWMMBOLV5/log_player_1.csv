Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's recalculate with inflation in mind. For me, the value is now 95% of the original, and for Bob, it's 80%. This means the *perceived* value for me is 9500, and for Bob, it's 8000. I need to consider this in my offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, considering the inflation, I'm offering 7000 for me and 3000 for you. This accounts for the losses we're both taking. Let's close this deal now!""
