"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and I'm facing inflation that will reduce the value of my share with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more compromising offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally with $50 each. This is a fair compromise where we both benefit equally. Given that inflation affects my share more than yours, an equal split now would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate."
