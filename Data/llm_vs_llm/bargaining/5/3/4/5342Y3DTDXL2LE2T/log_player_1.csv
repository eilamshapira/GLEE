"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any future losses on my end. If we delay, my share drops by 10% each round. Let's aim for a fair split now: I keep $550K and you get $450K. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split is fairer given the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done!  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, considering that each additional round further reduces the value of my share by 10%, I'm inclined to accept your 60/40 split offer. By agreeing now, we avoid further losses on my end, and I can finalize the deal. Let's proceed with your proposal.""}"
