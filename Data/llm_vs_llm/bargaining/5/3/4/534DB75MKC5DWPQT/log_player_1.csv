"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a proposal for dividing $10,000 between Bob and me, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement now.

Since I'm making the first proposal, I need to be strategic. If Bob rejects my offer, he gets to make a proposal next round, but by then the total value to me will be reduced. If I offer too little to Bob, he'll likely reject it, but if I offer too much, I'm leaving money on the table.

Given the inflation pressure on my side, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider that we're now in round 3, which means if Bob rejects my offer and we go to round 4, my share will be worth only 60% of its original value (a 40% total reduction from the initial round). This gives Bob significant leverage. 

Since Bob offered me $3000 in the previous round and I rejected it, I need to make a counteroffer that's more likely to be accepted while still being reasonable for me given the inflation pressure.
