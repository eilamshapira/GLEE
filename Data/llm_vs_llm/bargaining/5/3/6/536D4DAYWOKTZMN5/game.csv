450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to you. If we go to round 3, your $450000 would only be worth $360000 in value to you. This deal maximizes our collective value, as any further delays significantly reduce what you receive.",Bob,2,
