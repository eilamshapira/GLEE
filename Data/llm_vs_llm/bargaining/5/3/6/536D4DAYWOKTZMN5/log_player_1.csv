"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer considering that any delay will hurt me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair split of $450,000, which is close to 50-50. If you reject, the next round will have the money worth 20% less to me, so we both benefit from agreeing now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to you. If we go to round 3, your $450000 would only be worth $360000 in value to you. This deal maximizes our collective value, as any further delays significantly reduce what you receive. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $450,000 at 80% value = $360,000 effective value to me
2. If I reject and propose in next round, any amount I get will be worth only 60% of face value
3. Bob is correct that delays significantly hurt my position due to inflation
4. His offer is reasonable given the circumstances, as waiting another round would likely result in worse outcomes for me
