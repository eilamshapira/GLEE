"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair split of $450000, which is close to 50-50. If you reject, the next round will have the money worth 20% less to me, so we both benefit from agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000.

Important points to consider:
- This is a 45%-55% split in Alice's favor
- If I reject, we go to another round where I make the offer
- There's no inflation penalty for me (0%)
- Alice faces 20% inflation per round

While the offer is reasonable, I can likely get a better deal in the next round since Alice will be more motivated to accept due to her 20% inflation penalty. I believe I can propose a more favorable split for myself.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for Alice's declining value in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to you. If we go to round 3, your $450,000 would only be worth $360,000 in value to you. This deal maximizes our collective value, as any further delays significantly reduce what you receive.""}"
