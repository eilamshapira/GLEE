,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. However, considering the structure of the game where money devalues 5% each round for you but not for me, a slight adjustment seems reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This actually helps us both avoid further devaluation of your share through extended negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me, but a 60/40 split seems too skewed in your favor, especially this early in the game. Let's try to find a more balanced solution. My counter-offer is a 55/45 split in your favor, which acknowledges the inflation but keeps it more equitable.",Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, considering the inflation and to move forward, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor. This way, we both get a reasonable share and can avoid further devaluation of the money. What do you think?",Alice,3,
