Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. However, considering the structure of the game where money devalues 5% each round for you but not for me, a slight adjustment seems reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This actually helps us both avoid further devaluation of your share through extended negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me, but a 60/40 split seems too skewed in your favor, especially this early in the game. Let's try to find a more balanced solution. My counter-offer is a 55/45 split in your favor, which acknowledges the inflation but keeps it more equitable.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
