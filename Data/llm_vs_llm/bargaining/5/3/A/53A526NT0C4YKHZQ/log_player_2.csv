"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50/50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance.

However, I should consider the game dynamics:
- With each round, the money is worth 5% less to Alice but maintains the same value for me
- This means that if we go to later rounds, Alice has more incentive to accept less
- We have 12 rounds maximum

While 50/50 seems fair in a vacuum, the game structure gives me a strategic advantage. Since I don't face depreciation, I could potentially get a better deal in later rounds when Alice's potential gains are worth less to her.

I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges the game dynamics while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. However, considering the structure of the game where money devalues 5% each round for you but not for me, a slight adjustment seems reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This actually helps us both avoid further devaluation of your share through extended negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation and to move forward, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor. This way, we both get a reasonable share and can avoid further devaluation of the money. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $55 and taking $45 for herself. This is more favorable to me than her initial 50/50 split, but not as good as my proposed 60/40 split.

Key considerations:
- Alice's money is already worth 9.75% less to her
- If we continue to the next round, her money will be worth even less
- This gives me increasing leverage in negotiations
- However, there's also risk in prolonged negotiations

While I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting, Alice has moved significantly in my direction. Getting $55 now is guaranteed, whereas pushing further introduces risk.

I'll accept this reasonable compromise.
