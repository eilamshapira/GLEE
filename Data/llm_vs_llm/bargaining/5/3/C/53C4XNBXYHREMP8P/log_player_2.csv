"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $4,000 now vs potential for more but at 90% value next round
5. This isn't a 50-50 split, but it's not terrible considering inflation risk

I'll reject this offer because even with 10% inflation, I can try to negotiate a better deal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that:
1. Money is now worth 90% of original value to me
2. Alice's first offer showed she wants a larger share
3. I should propose something that's attractive enough for Alice to accept while improving my position

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""A more balanced split that's still favorable to you, let's avoid further inflation losses""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,200, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth $3,402 to me
2. This is only slightly better than her first offer ($4,000), and after inflation it's actually worse
3. If I reject and go to next round:
   - Inflation will increase to 29% for me
   - I could make another offer, but the value keeps decreasing
   - We're getting into dangerous territory with inflation

Given that:
- Further rounds will significantly erode my purchasing power
- The difference between offers is getting smaller
- Risk of getting an even worse deal if negotiations continue
