"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a more equitable offer. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount before inflation hits us too hard. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4050 to me
2. If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less due to inflation
3. Bob's offering a fairly reasonable split, and we're already losing value
4. The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get
5. This is a decent offer early in the game
