"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a small premium for me as the first mover."
