"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a fair and reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll aim for a middle ground that could be appealing to both of us, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 evenly between us, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000.

Considering this, Bob's offer gives him $600,000 (at full value) and me $320,000 (due to the inflation effect). This doesn't seem like a fair split, especially since I'm the one affected by the inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I need to make a proposal that takes into account the diminishing value for me but also tries to find a mutually acceptable agreement.

In Round 2, the value for me was 80% of the original. Now, in Round 3, it will be 80% of 80%, which is 64% of the original value. So, if I propose $X for myself, its real value to me is 64% of $X.

To make a fair offer, I should consider that Bob's valuation remains constant, but I need to adjust for my decreasing valuation. Aiming for a compromise, I'll offer slightly more to Bob than I would in an even split, considering my devalued share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This offer gives me $450,000, which, at 64% value, equals $288,000 in real value to me, and gives Bob $550,000. This is a bit more favorable to Bob than an even split would be for me in real terms, but it's a compromise considering the inflation effect on my share."
