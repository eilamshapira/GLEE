"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 equally: $500,000 each. Given that my share devalues by 5% each round, settling now avoids future losses. Let's both secure our gains and agree to a fair division immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your share devalues by 5% each round, I propose a slightly uneven split. This way, we both still receive a substantial amount, and I get a bit more for taking on the uncertainty of your inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
