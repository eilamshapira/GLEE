"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equally: $500000 each. Given that my share devalues by 5% each round, settling now avoids future losses. Let's both secure our gains and agree to a fair division immediately. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
