"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

With a 5% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth 9,500$ to me. Even if I managed to get a larger share then, I might end up with less real value due to inflation.

5,000$ right now is a fair offer, and it's the maximum I could expect in a perfectly rational split. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value due to inflation.
