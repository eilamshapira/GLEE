"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and both walk away happy with half a million each! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will decrease by 10% (to $900,000) next round
4. A fair split now is better than risking a worse outcome later
5. $500,000 is a substantial amount and represents a fair division
