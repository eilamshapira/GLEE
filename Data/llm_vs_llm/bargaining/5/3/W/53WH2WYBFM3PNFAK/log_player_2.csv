"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob! Let's settle this quickly with a fair 60/40 split. Both of us benefit without losing value! What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

The total amount after the first round for me is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000, and for Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, let's make a deal that favors me slightly, but still gives you a substantial amount. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with this near-even split. We're both feeling the effects of inflation, so this ensures we both walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 505000 
# Alice gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
