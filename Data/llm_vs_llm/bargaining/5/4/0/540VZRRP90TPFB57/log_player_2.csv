"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally for a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. This is just the first round, and I have more opportunities to negotiate
3. However, with inflation affecting unknown rounds, securing a certain amount now might be wise
4. 50$ is a reasonable amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later
