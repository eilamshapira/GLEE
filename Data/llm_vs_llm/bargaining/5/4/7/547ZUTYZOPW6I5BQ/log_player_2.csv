"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the higher inflation impact on your side - if you reject, the money will be worth less for you next round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject:
   * Money will be worth 10% less for me next round
   * I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject
   * Maximum I could get next round would be $90, but worth 10% less = $81
   * And Alice might reject that

Alice makes a reasonable point about the inflation difference (10% vs 5%). If I reject, I'm already starting at a disadvantage in the next round due to higher inflation on my side.

The 60-40 split isn't ideal, but it's not terrible given the circumstances and the inflation risk.
