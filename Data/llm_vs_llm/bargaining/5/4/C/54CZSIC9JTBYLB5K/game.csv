714286.0,285714.0,"Hi Bob, considering that further rounds reduce the value of the money (10% for me and 20% for you), I believe this division is fair. By accepting now, you’ll secure a solid 285714—and both of us avoid further discounting. I trust you’ll agree that utility matters more than waiting. Best, Alice.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob,

I know we’re under pressure with the discounting — in this round the amounts will be worth 81% for me and 64% for you if we agree now. I’m proposing a nominal split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. In real terms, that’s about $445500 for me and $288000 for you. While I realize this gives you a bit less than a 50–50 cut, it’s important to note that if we delay further, your share will devalue even more. This offer improves on what you’d likely secure by waiting to propose in the next round, considering the 36% drop on your portion. I hope you see that acting now preserves significantly more value for both of us. Let’s conclude this before the pie shrinks further.

Best,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I'm trying to find a compromise here. Your offer was close, but I need a little more to make it worthwhile. This offer ensures a reasonable split for both of us, even with the discounting.",Bob,4,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob,

Considering the discounting in this round (my amounts are worth 65.61% and yours 40.96% of their nominal values), I propose the following division: I receive $400000 and you receive $600000. In effective terms, that gives me about $262440 (400000 × 0.6561) and you about $245760 (600000 × 0.4096). This offer is designed to match what you might expect if you waited to propose in the next round while still preserving as much total value as possible. I believe it’s a fair compromise under these conditions and a strong alternative to further delay, which only hurts both of our interests.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
