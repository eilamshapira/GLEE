"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates for both of us, which should lead to a fair outcome.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4500, Bob, which is slightly less than half now, but remember that inflation affects you more severely (20% per round vs my 10%). If we keep negotiating, both our shares will be worth less. This is a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer considering our inflation rates and the negotiation history.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

Bob, I'm offering you $4700 now. With each round, inflation is reducing the value more severely for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). If we go another round, your money will be worth even less. This is a reasonable compromise from both our initial offers that accounts for the inflation differential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering our current inflation rates and negotiation pattern.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900}

Bob, I'm offering you $4900 now. At this point, inflation has significantly reduced the value - for you it's already about 59% less than the original value, while for me it's about 34% less. This split is very fair considering our different inflation rates. If we continue to another round, your share will be worth even less due to your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise."
