"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair since inflation affects me, and we both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
