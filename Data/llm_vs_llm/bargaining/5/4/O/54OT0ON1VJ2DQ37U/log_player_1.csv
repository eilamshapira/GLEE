"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly. Considering the inflation, a 55/45 split seems fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
My gain: $450,000 × 0.8 = $360,000 (effective value due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: $550,000 × 0.9 = $495,000 (effective value due to 10% inflation)

If I reject and we go to next round:
- The money will be worth even less (another 20% less for me)
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal
- Bob might reject my next offer, leading to even more value loss

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, getting $360,000 in effective value now is better than risking further depreciation. The difference between our effective gains ($495,000 vs $360,000) is significant, but waiting would likely make things worse for me.
