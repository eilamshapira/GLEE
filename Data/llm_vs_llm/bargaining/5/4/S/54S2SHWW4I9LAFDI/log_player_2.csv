"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given that the money loses 5% of its value for me with each passing round.

If I reject now, we go to the next round where I can make a proposal. However, the $100 would only be worth $95 to me then. So even if I could get more than $45 in the next round, I need to factor in this depreciation.

If I propose a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 worth only $47.50 to me after the 5% inflation. That's better than $45 now.

However, Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more depreciation for me.

Given the asymmetric inflation penalty I face, I think it's better to accept this reasonable first offer.
