"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This would give each of us a fair share to start with. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is completely fair for both of us. Given that I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty each round, this seems like a reasonable compromise. I hope we can agree on this and avoid further depreciation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
