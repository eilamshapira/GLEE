"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This would give each of us a fair share to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to be careful because inflation will reduce the value of the money by 20% for me. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me. To get the same value as the $40 being offered now, I would need to secure at least $50 in the next round.

Given the inflation effect, Alice's current offer of $40 is not that unfair, but I think I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for inflation. If we reject each other's offers, the money will continue to lose value for me, so I should propose a reasonable split that Alice is likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is completely fair for both of us. Given that I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty each round, this seems like a reasonable compromise. I hope we can agree on this and avoid further depreciation of the money.""}"
