Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid unnecessary delays (and my money losing value), I propose we settle now: you get $520,000 and I get $480,000. I believe this fair split benefits both of us and avoids any inflation risks. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation risk is the same for me, I propose a 55-45 split. Let's settle now and avoid further delays. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
