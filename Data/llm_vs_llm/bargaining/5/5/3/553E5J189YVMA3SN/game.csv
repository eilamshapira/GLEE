6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly to start! I'm offering a 60/40 split. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation affecting your share more. What do you think?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's adjust. Considering the inflation impact, I'll offer a 55/45 split this time. I hope this is acceptable.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This should still leave you with a good amount considering the depreciation. Let's settle this round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright, let's go for a straight 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest approach at this point, considering inflation. We both get a good amount, and we can finish the game.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"With inflation hitting your share harder each round, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This still gives you a significant amount, adjusted for the current value. Let's end this soon.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Okay, let's try this. I'll offer a 45/55 split. I'm trying to balance things out with the inflation. I hope you see this as reasonable.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a reasonable amount given the current value. Let's wrap this up.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'll propose a 40/60 split now. I'm getting concerned about running out of time and the impact of inflation. This is a better offer, I think.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"With only a few rounds left and the heavy impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 75/25 split in my favor. This still gives you something significant considering the current value. Let's finalize this soon.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Okay, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our shares. I'll offer a 35/65 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing if we run out of time. Let's take this deal.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"This is our last round, and with inflation severely impacting your share, I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. It's better than nothing for both of us. Let's agree and end this game.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
