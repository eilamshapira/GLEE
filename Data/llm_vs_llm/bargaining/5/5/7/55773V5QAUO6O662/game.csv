550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any delay and the detrimental effects of inflation on my share, I propose we settle now. I would receive $550000 while you get $450000. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both if we act swiftly. What do you say?",Alice,1,

55000.0,945000.0,"Bob, I realize that with every delay my share loses 10% of its value, and your bargaining power increases in later rounds. To preempt further erosion and to give you a slightly better immediate effective payoff than waiting until round 4, I’m offering you $945000 while I take $55000. This way, given the current 20% discount on my side (making my effective gain $44000) and your implicit discount of about 10% this round (yielding an effective $850500), you’re getting just a bit more than what you could secure by postponing. I believe this offer reflects the cost of delay for both of us and helps us settle promptly. What do you think?",Alice,3,
