"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any delay and the detrimental effects of inflation on my share, I propose we settle now. I would receive $550,000 while you get $450,000. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both if we act swiftly. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation impacts. This offer is fair, considering we both want to maximize our gains without delaying further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55000, ""bob_gain"": 945000, ""message"": ""Bob, I realize that with every delay my share loses 10% of its value, and your bargaining power increases in later rounds. To preempt further erosion and to give you a slightly better immediate effective payoff than waiting until round 4, I’m offering you $945,000 while I take $55,000. This way, given the current 20% discount on my side (making my effective gain $44,000) and your implicit discount of about 10% this round (yielding an effective $850,500), you’re getting just a bit more than what you could secure by postponing. I believe this offer reflects the cost of delay for both of us and helps us settle promptly. What do you think?""}"
