Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round further devalues your money. If you reject and wait until round 3, you'll be the proposer but you'll be forced to give nearly everything to me to get my agreement, leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now and secure your share before further discounting hits. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is not on your side—the more rounds we delay, the more your share gets crushed by inflation (now worth only 51.2% of its face value). If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5, but you’ll be forced to concede nearly every dollar to me so I’ll accept, leaving you practically with nothing. Accept 1 dollar now to secure something rather than risk ending up empty-handed.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is now crushing your share even more—every dollar you wait for is worth only about 32.8 cents in real value. If you reject this offer, you'll enter round 7 where you'll be forced to propose, but you'll end up conceding nearly all the money to me because I don't suffer any devaluation. I'm offering you $1 nominal (worth about 33 cents now), which is strictly better than the zero you can expect if we delay further. Accept this offer now and preserve what little value remains for you.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

I'm offering you $1 now—it's far better than the even smaller real value you'd get by waiting for the next round.
