"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation that Alice will suffer, otherwise, with each passing round, Alice will have less and less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every extra round further devalues your money. If you reject and wait until round 3, you'll be the proposer but you'll be forced to give nearly everything to me to get my agreement, leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now and secure your share before further discounting hits.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hurting me, but I still need a reasonable share. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? It's better than nothing for both of us, and avoids another round of devaluation for me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, time is not on your side—the more rounds we delay, the more your share gets crushed by inflation (now worth only 51.2% of its face value). If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5, but you’ll be forced to concede nearly every dollar to me so I’ll accept, leaving you practically with nothing. Accept 1 dollar now to secure something rather than risk ending up empty-handed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is killing me, but 1 dollar is unacceptable. How about we meet in the middle from last round and do 52/48. It is beneficial to both of us, as neither of us are losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your effort, the current offer gives me only $48 whereas if we proceed another round—as I'll have the proposal power—I can secure nearly the entire $100. Given that my funds remain at full value and your funds suffer even more devaluation, it’s in my best interest to move on. Therefore, I must reject this offer.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is now crushing your share even more—every dollar you wait for is worth only about 32.8 cents in real value. If you reject this offer, you'll enter round 7 where you'll be forced to propose, but you'll end up conceding nearly all the money to me because I don't suffer any devaluation. I'm offering you $1 nominal (worth about 33 cents now), which is strictly better than the zero you can expect if we delay further. Accept this offer now and preserve what little value remains for you.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know I've been stubborn, and the inflation has hurt me badly. But I'm offering a 50/50 split now. It's the fairest offer I can make. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while a 50/50 split might seem fair at nominal values, the reality is that your share today is worth significantly less due to inflation. If I reject this offer and propose in the next round, I can secure nearly the entire sum for myself without any loss in value, while your share will devalue even further. For these reasons, I must reject your 50/50 proposal.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, the situation is only getting worse for you. With each round, your share loses actual value while mine remains intact. I'm offering you $1 now—it's far better than the even smaller real value you'd get by waiting for the next round. Accept this offer to secure what little value remains before it evaporates completely.""}"
