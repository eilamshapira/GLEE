"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Current offer: I get $45, Alice gets $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * My $100 will be worth $95 (5% less)
   * Alice's $100 will be worth $90 (10% less)
3. So next round, even if I propose a better split for me, the total value will be less
4. $45 now is better than potentially getting $50-60 of depreciated money next round

This is actually a pretty fair offer considering I can make the first counter-offer if I reject. But the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive.
