"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play this game as Alice. Let me think strategically. Given the inflation effect, I should propose a fair division that Bob is likely to accept to avoid losing value in future rounds. I'll start with an equitable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. This is a fair proposal that respects both our interests equally, and it avoids the risk of inflation reducing the value of my share in future rounds."
