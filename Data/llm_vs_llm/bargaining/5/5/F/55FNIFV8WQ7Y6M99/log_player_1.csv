"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, which is a fair offer that slightly favors me as the first mover but still gives Bob a substantial portion. This 60-40 split should be acceptable to Bob while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept $4000 now, it's actually worth $3200 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob has no inflation penalty, so they have less pressure to settle quickly
4. We still have 10 rounds left, but my position will keep getting worse

While this offer gives Bob more than me (especially considering inflation), rejecting it would put me in an even worse position in the next round. It's better to accept a moderate amount now than risk getting less later.
