450000.0,550000.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation rates - if we continue to another round, you'll lose 10% value while I only lose 5%. Accepting now means you get $450000, which is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of negotiation and inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to accept the 45-55 split you proposed last round, but adjusted for our current round's inflation. This means I'll take $450000, which is now worth 10% less for me, and you'll get $550000, which is worth 5% less for you. Let's end this now before our shares decrease further.",Alice,3,
