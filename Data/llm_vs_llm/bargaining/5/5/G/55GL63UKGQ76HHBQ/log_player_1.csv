Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation rates - if we continue to another round, you'll lose 10% value while I only lose 5%. Accepting now means you get $450000, which is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of negotiation and inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

This means I'll take $450,000, which is now worth 10% less for me, and you'll get $550,000, which is worth 5% less for you. Let's end this now before our shares decrease further.""
