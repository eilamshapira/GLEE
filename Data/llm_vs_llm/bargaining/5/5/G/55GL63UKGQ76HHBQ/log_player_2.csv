"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we can end the game now without any losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. If I reject and make my own offer next round, I need to account for 5% inflation on my side.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value to me would be $950,000 (5% less), and for Alice it would be $900,000 (10% less). This means I could potentially offer a split that gives me more than $500,000 while still being acceptable to Alice.

However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value lost to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates (5% for me, 10% for Alice), I'll make an offer that recognizes this asymmetry while still being fair enough that Alice would likely accept rather than continuing to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation rates - if we continue to another round, you'll lose 10% value while I only lose 5%. Accepting now means you get $450,000, which is worth more than what you might get after further rounds of negotiation and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to accept the 45-55 split you proposed last round, but adjusted for our current round's inflation. This means I'll take $450000, which is now worth 10% less for me, and you'll get $550000, which is worth 5% less for you. Let's end this now before our shares decrease further. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $550,000, which is exactly what I proposed in round 2.

Due to inflation, the current $550,000 is worth 9.75% less to me than the original value in round 1. So the real value to me is approximately $496,375.

If I reject and go to round 4, the total money would be worth even less due to further inflation. I would lose another 5% value, and Alice would lose another 10% value.

Since Alice has accepted the split I proposed in the previous round, and further negotiation would likely result in more value lost to inflation for both of us, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
