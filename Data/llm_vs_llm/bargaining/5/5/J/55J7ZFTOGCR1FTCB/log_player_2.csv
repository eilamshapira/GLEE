"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a substantial $450000 while keeping $550000 for myself. This is a reasonable split that saves us both time and ensures we both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. If I reject and go to the next round, the inflation factor means the total amount will be worth 20% less to me, so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 in the next round from my perspective.

If I reject, I would make the next offer, but the maximum I could get would be worth 20% less to me. Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, the inflation would significantly reduce my potential gain.

$450,000 now is better than a potentially higher percentage of a 20% devalued pot. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a substantial amount.
