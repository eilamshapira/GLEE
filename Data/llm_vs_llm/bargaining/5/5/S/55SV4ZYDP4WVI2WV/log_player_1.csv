"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $100 in round 1 is now worth $80 to me (100 - 20% = 80). I'd effectively be getting 60 in round 1. This offer gives me 45. Therefore, I should reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3. Remember, inflation is eating away at my share! My $100 in round 1 is now only worth $64 (100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 64), and I will propose the division based on that value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
