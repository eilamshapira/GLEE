"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that is fair but also accounts for the fact that inflation affects me more than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This slightly favors me to compensate for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
