"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $45, keeping $55 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty for Alice (but not for me), any money Alice gets next round will be worth less to her.

In the next round, I could offer her something like $52-53, which after the 5% inflation would be worth about $49.50 to her - less than she'd get now. Since this would be rational for her to accept and would give me $47-48, rejecting this offer makes sense.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a strategic counter-offer considering the 5% inflation penalty that affects Alice but not me.

If I offer Alice $53, due to the 5% inflation, it will be worth approximately $50.35 to her. This is less than the $55 she would have gotten in round 1, but still a significant amount that should be rational for her to accept. This way, I get $47 which is better than the $45 she initially offered me.

{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53}

I propose this split because it's a win-win situation - I get more than her initial offer, while she still gets a reasonable amount that's worth accepting given the inflation penalty she faces."
