"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the 20% depreciation per round for me. Since Bob doesn't face depreciation, he might be incentivized to delay, but a fair initial offer could prevent that.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it, considering that waiting would reduce my buying power significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $300,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $240,000
* If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
* If Bob rejects my counter-offer in round 3, we go to round 4 where my gains would be worth 60% less

Given the significant depreciation I face and the risk of Bob continuing to reject offers (since he faces no depreciation), I should accept this offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, waiting would only weaken my position further.
