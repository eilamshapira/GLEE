"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. Since this is the first round, I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty for each round I delay.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value would be worth 10% less to me. While I could propose a more favorable split, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that $40 is a substantial portion of the total, I'll accept this offer.
