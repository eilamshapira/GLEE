"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $40 while she gets $60. Despite her message about ""fair share,"" this is actually not an equal division of the $100. I get less than half, while she gets more.

Since we're taking turns making offers, if I reject this one, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round. I believe I can propose a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal split which seems fair since we're both participating equally in this game. This way we both walk away with the same amount.""}"
