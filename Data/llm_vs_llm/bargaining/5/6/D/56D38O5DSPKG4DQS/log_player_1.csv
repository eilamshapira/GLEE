"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that balances fairness with the consideration of inflation affecting my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's reasonably fair while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round. I'm offering you a substantial portion while keeping enough to make it worthwhile for me."
