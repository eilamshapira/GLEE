Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We both deserve an equal share. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation affects my gains by 10%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
