"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I take 80% and you get 20%. We can adjust in the next rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's first offer. She's proposing I get 20% ($200,000) while she gets 80% ($800,000). This is far from an equal split, and I need to remember that with each round, inflation reduces the value of my share by 10%. 

Given this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I believe I can negotiate for a better division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We both deserve an equal share. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation affects my gains by 10%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
