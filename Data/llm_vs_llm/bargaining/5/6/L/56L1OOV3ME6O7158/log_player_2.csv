"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, any future gains will be worth 20% less to me. Even if I could negotiate for more in the next round, the 20% inflation penalty makes rejection risky.
