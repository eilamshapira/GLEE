"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer that considers our decreasing value of money over time, while trying to be fair.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor because the money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). This makes the present more valuable for you than future rounds. This is a fair first offer given the asymmetric inflation rates.""
