"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor because the money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). This makes the present more valuable for you than future rounds. This is a fair first offer given the asymmetric inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
