"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to maximize my potential gain, but I also need to be realistic to avoid rejection and the ensuing inflation. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a starting point. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a relatively fair offer, considering I'm the one making the initial proposal, and that accepting this is better than risking a 20% loss of value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4444 
# Bob gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The total value is still $10,000, but the real value is less than round 1. Bob's offer is 4444 for me and 5556 for him. Let's analyze:

*   **My previous offer:** I wanted $6000 in Round 1. With inflation, getting $6000 in Round 2 is equivalent to getting $6000 / 0.8 = $7500 in Round 1.
*   **Bob's current offer:** $4444 is equivalent to $4444 / 0.8 = $5555 in round 1.

While it's lower than what I initially wanted, waiting for the next round means another 20% inflation, so it may not be a good decision.

Decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
