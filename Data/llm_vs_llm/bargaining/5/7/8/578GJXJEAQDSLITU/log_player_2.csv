"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50. Fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

A 50/50 split would give me $500,000 in round 1. If I reject and we go to round 2, any amount I receive would be worth 20% less due to inflation. So if I were to get even $600,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $480,000 to me after inflation.

Given that:
1. The first offer is quite fair
2. Inflation will eat into my gains in future rounds
3. There's uncertainty about Alice's future offers
4. We risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

It's rational to accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
