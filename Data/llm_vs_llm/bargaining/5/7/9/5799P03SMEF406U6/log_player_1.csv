"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me and the limited number of rounds. To start, I'll make a generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My money is worth 10% less, so receiving $550,000 in round 1 was equivalent to receiving $495,000 now (550000 * 0.9 = 495000). Bob is offering $500,000 now, which is slightly better than my adjusted offer from last round. Given that it's still early in the game, I'll accept.

""decision"": ""accept""
