"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in later rounds. To maximize my gain while also making the offer acceptable to Bob (given his inflation rate), I will propose a relatively generous split in this first round.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a split where I receive $450,000 and he receives $550,000. The key here is to consider the impact of future inflation. For me, the value of money remains constant. For Bob, it's depreciating by 10% each round.

If I reject this offer, I risk getting less in future rounds due to the increasing number of rounds.

Let's analyze: If I accept, I get $450,000. If I reject, I need to make an offer in round 3. The amount available is still $1,000,000, but the game is more risky.

Therefore, to avoid further risk, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
