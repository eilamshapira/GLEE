"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering that inflation affects you more than me, so this division accounts for the time value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more accommodating offer considering the inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and you get $48. Since inflation reduces your money's value by 20% each round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement sooner. This is a compromise that gives you more than my previous offer, and I hope we can agree on this fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced offer considering the increasing inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a perfectly even split where I get $50 and you get $50. This is a completely fair division that gives us equal amounts. With inflation continuing to reduce the value of your share, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. I hope we can agree on this equitable arrangement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the significant inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose I get $45 and you get $55. I've reduced my share significantly from my initial offer. With the substantial inflation (over 67% already and increasing), the actual value you'd receive is diminishing rapidly. This offer gives you the majority of the money, and I think it's fair given our situation. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds reduce the effective value for you even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm making a generous offer considering the extreme inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I propose I get $40 and you get $60. I'm giving you the majority of the money. With inflation now reducing your value by almost 80%, we're running out of rounds, and further delays will only hurt both of us. This offer gives you a substantial advantage in the nominal amount, which helps offset the inflation effect. Let's reach an agreement now rather than risk getting nothing in the end."
