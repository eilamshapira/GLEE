While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, the rapid inflation means I need to aim for a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time."

I'm starting to get very concerned about the shrinking value of the money. While not ideal, accepting 60% now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
