"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's do 55/45. It accounts for inflation, especially for you, Alice, and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation penalty for me, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $4500 I'd receive is effectively worth $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 to me.

Given this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation penalty, which is now 20% + 20% = 36% less for me (since it's cumulative), I'll make a new offer.

The effective value of the money for me is now 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, so I'll try to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's adjust the split to reflect the changing value!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting you more. I offer a 60/40 split in my favor to compensate. This is the fairest deal we'll get. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the 48.8% inflation penalty for me, the $4000 I'd receive is effectively worth $4000 * (1 - 0.488) = $4000 * 0.512 = $2048 to me.

While Bob's offer may seem reasonable at first, the inflation penalty significantly reduces the value of the money I'd receive. However, I must consider that the penalty will only increase in subsequent rounds, further reducing the value of any potential gain.

Given this, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer, as it may be the best deal I can get under the current circumstances.
