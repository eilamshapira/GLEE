"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the risk of inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45, as I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty if Bob declines and we move to the next round. This offer gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against inflation risk."
