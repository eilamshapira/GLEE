"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make it fair and simple. We each take $500000. How does that sound? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, I can make the next offer
2. The money devalues faster for me (10%) than for Alice (5%) each round
3. We have a limited number of rounds (12)

Given that the devaluation rate works against me more than Alice, delaying might not be in my best interest. A 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable, as any delay will result in both of us getting less value.
