"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a good chunk to start. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me (I'll only get 90% value)
   * For Alice, it will be worth 95% value
   * But I'll get to make the next proposal

The current split (40/60) isn't particularly favorable to me. Since I'll have the advantage of making the next proposal and Alice's discount rate is lower than mine, I could potentially get a better deal even accounting for the 10% depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth 90% to me and 95% to Alice. I should propose a deal that's good enough for Alice to accept (considering her 5% depreciation if she rejects) while maximizing my gain.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since time affects both of us negatively, let's make a deal now. This split gives you $4,500 which is worth more now than a larger amount in the next round due to depreciation.""}"
