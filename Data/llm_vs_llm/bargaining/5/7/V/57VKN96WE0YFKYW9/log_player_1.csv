"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of a discounted alternating‐offer game (with a 5% loss of value each round and 12 rounds total), the subgame perfect equilibrium yields a very uneven split in Round 1. In equilibrium, if you (Alice) make the first offer then Bob’s continuation value (what he could secure as proposer in Round 2) comes out to roughly 76.43% of the current $1,000,000. To make Bob indifferent between accepting your offer now and waiting to propose next round, you must offer him about 76.43% of the total in Round 1. That leaves about 23.57% for you.

Thus, a proposal in Round 1 that reflects this equilibrium is approximately:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 235720.94,
  ""bob_gain"": 764279.06
}

(These amounts are approximate; any offer extremely close to these numbers should be acceptable in equilibrium.) 

Here is the JSON message: 

{""alice_gain"": 235720.94, ""bob_gain"": 764279.06}"
