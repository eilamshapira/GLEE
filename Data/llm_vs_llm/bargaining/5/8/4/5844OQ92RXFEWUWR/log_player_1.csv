"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair and balanced offer to divide the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint outcome, especially considering that if we drag this negotiation into future rounds, inflation will reduce the total value available to both of us."
