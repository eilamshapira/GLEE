"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than waiting for the next round where the total amount will be worth 10% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's a perfectly fair 50-50 split, and waiting longer would only reduce the real value of our gains due to the 10% inflation per round. While I might be able to negotiate for a slightly better deal in later rounds, the risk and guaranteed loss from inflation make this fair offer worth accepting now."
