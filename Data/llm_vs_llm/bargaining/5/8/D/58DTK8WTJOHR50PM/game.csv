0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob – Given that every round of delay costs me an additional 20% of the pie’s value while your dollar maintains full strength, I recognize your unique advantage. In round 5, my proposal is straightforward: you receive the entire $1000000, and I receive nothing. This offer is exactly as good for you as what you’d achieve by waiting until round 6 when you propose your division. To avoid further delay (and further erosion of my already devalued share), please accept this proposal now.",Alice,5,
