"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – Since each delay costs me 20% of the pie’s value while you face no such loss, I recognize that if you wait you can secure the whole million. To avoid any further costly delays, I’m offering you the full $1000000 right now. Please accept.

To avoid further delay and finalize the division now, please accept this offer.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – Given that every round of delay costs me an additional 20% of the pie’s value while your dollar maintains full strength, I recognize your unique advantage. In round 5, my proposal is straightforward: you receive the entire $1000000, and I receive nothing. This offer is exactly as good for you as what you’d achieve by waiting until round 6 when you propose your division. To avoid further delay (and further erosion of my already devalued share), please accept this proposal now.
