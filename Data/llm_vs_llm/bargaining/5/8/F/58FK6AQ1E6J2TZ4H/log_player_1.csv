"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The total amount is now worth less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), 5% less: 100 * 0.95 = 95
For Bob, 20% less: 100 * 0.8 = 80

Bob's offer:
I get 40, which is worth 40 * 0.95 = 38
He gets 60, which is worth 60 * 0.8 = 48

I don't think this is a fair offer, considering I'm the one who made a reasonable proposal in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now worth even less:
For me (Alice), 5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2: 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25
For Bob, 20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2: 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 64

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. The money is losing value fast. This is a better deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation.

The total amount is now worth less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), 5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, and 5% less in Round 3 (but it was my turn, so only 2 rounds of inflation for me, and then this round): 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 85.74, but since it is 14.26% less: 100 * 0.8574 = 85.74
For Bob, 20% less in Round 1, 20% less in Round 2, and 20% less in Round 3: 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 51.2, but since it is 48.8% less (1 - 0.512):  100 * 0.512 = 51.2

Bob's offer:
I get 45, which is worth 45 * 0.8574 = 38.58
He gets 55, which is worth 55 * 0.512 = 28.16

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now worth even less:
For me (Alice), 5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, and 5% less in Round 4: 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 81.46
For Bob, 20% less in Round 1, 20% less in Round 2, 20% less in Round 3, and 20% less in Round 4: 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 40.96

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time and money. Let's make a deal before it's too late. This offer is more in my favor, but it's still better than getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop messing around. We're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation.

The total amount is now worth less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), 5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, 5% less in Round 4, and 5% less in Round 5 (but it was my turn, so only 2 rounds of inflation for me, and then this round, and the previous rounds): 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 77.38, but since it is 22.62% less: 100 * 0.7738 = 77.38
For Bob, 20% less in Round 1, 20% less in Round 2, 20% less in Round 3, 20% less in Round 4, and 20% less in Round 5: 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 32.77, but since it is 67.23% less (1 - 0.3277):  100 * 0.3277 = 32.77

Bob's offer:
I get 50, which is worth 50 * 0.7738 = 38.69
He gets 50, which is worth 50 * 0.3277 = 16.385

Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob, a 50/50 split is actually in my favor. I think it's a good idea to accept this offer, as the difference in value is substantial, and I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation.
