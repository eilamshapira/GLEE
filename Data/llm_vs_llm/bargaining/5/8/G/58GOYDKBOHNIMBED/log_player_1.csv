"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both face inflation, and waiting will reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is a factor. My offer reflects the diminishing value, so let's try a more equitable split. This offer is 45/55, and I hope you'll accept it this time. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $550,000 is now worth effectively $440,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% less)
3. The split is relatively fair, and waiting would only decrease the value further
4. Bob has made a reasonable compromise from the initial offer
