Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, time is money 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 48, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is approximately 48 * 0.81 = 38.88.

Given this, I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing, and it's affecting me more than Alice. I'll try to make a more generous offer to Alice, hoping she'll accept it.
