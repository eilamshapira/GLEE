550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You face 20% depreciation per round while I face 5%, so taking this first deal avoids significant loss for you. This is a generous offer given your higher inflation rate.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm facing a higher inflation rate, so I need to ensure I secure a fair amount. This offer reflects that.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. You're facing 20% inflation per round while I'm only facing 5%. By round 4, your money will be worth less than 50% of its original value. My offer gives you $400000 right now, which is worth much more than waiting another round. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation pressures.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, the inflation is starting to hit hard.  Let's split the money evenly to minimize our losses. This is the fairest solution given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and with each round, your money loses 20% of its value. At this point, your $350000 now is worth more than $500000 two rounds from now. I'm facing much lower inflation at only 5% per round. The longer we negotiate, the worse deal you'll get due to our inflation rate difference. This offer is economically rational given our constraints.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm willing to concede to a larger share for you, but I need to ensure I get at least $400000 to make this worth it for me.",Bob,6,
