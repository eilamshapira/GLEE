""bob_gain"": 450000,

""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. You're facing 20% inflation per round while I'm only facing 5%. By round 4, your money will be worth less than 50% of its original value. My offer gives you $400,000 right now, which is worth much more than waiting another round. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation pressures.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and with each round, your money loses 20% of its value. At this point, your $350,000 now is worth more than $500,000 two rounds from now. I'm facing much lower inflation at only 5% per round. The longer we negotiate, the worse deal you'll get due to our inflation rate difference. This offer is economically rational given our constraints.""}"

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
