"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You face 20% depreciation per round while I face 5%, so taking this first deal avoids significant loss for you. This is a generous offer given your higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. You're facing 20% inflation per round while I'm only facing 5%. By round 4, your money will be worth less than 50% of its original value. My offer gives you $400000 right now, which is worth much more than waiting another round. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation pressures. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and with each round, your money loses 20% of its value. At this point, your $350000 now is worth more than $500000 two rounds from now. I'm facing much lower inflation at only 5% per round. The longer we negotiate, the worse deal you'll get due to our inflation rate difference. This offer is economically rational given our constraints. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
