"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My Offer's Impact:** Since I rejected the first offer, and due to inflation, my money is now worth less. I need to calculate how much the 40$ I'm offered is actually worth. The original $100 is now worth $100 * (1 - 0.20) = $80 for me.
*   **Calculating the new value:** My offered gain is 40$. Thus it is 40/80 = 0.5 (50%) of the original value.

Given the conditions, I will accept the offer.
