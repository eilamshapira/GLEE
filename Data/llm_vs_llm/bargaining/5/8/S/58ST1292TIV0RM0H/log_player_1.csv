"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split: $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties and should be acceptable to Bob. If he declines, the next round's money will be worth 5% less to me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000 (worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value)
2. He wants $550,000 (worth 80% of original value for him)
3. This is fairly close to a 50-50 split when accounting for our respective inflation rates
4. If I reject, next round my money will be worth even less (90% of original value)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further value loss makes this a reasonable offer
