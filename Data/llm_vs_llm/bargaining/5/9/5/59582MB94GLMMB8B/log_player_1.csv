"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, accepting this now maximizes your value. If we go to another round, your $5000 would be worth only $4000 to you in perceived value. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
