"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a generous offer, let's end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $4,000 while she takes $6,000 out of our $10,000 total.

Given that inflation affects Alice (her money is worth 20% less each round) but doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), I have an advantage in negotiation by waiting for future rounds. If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-proposal that gives me more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation penalty Alice faces while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, accepting this now maximizes your value. If we go to another round, your $5,000 would be worth only $4,000 to you in perceived value. This is a fair deal for both of us.""}"
