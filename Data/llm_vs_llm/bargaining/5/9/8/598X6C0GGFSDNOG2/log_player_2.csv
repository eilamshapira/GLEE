Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. I need to account for the significant inflation I'll experience if we go further rounds. I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me, but still gives Alice a good chunk to incentivize her to accept.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 4. Inflation is starting to bite. I need to be more careful. Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, but I need to get a worthwhile amount for myself. I'll try a slightly more conciliatory offer, but still prioritize my gains given the inflation. My money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, while Alice's money is worth 14.26% less.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, this is getting risky. The inflation is really hurting me now. I need to try and close this deal. I will try to make a deal that's only slightly better for me than Alice's last offer.
