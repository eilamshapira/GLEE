"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite favorable to her, as she's suggesting she gets 80% of the money while I only get 20%. Given that we have 12 rounds and the money loses 20% value each round, I should consider whether I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, recognizing that we both lose if we delay too long due to the 20% inflation each round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money evenly at $5,000 each. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective outcome and avoids the risk of continued negotiation reducing the total value."
