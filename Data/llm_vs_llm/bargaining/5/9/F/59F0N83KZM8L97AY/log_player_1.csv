"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split considering the 10% per round inflation that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor because I need to account for the possibility of future rounds where my money will be worth less due to inflation. If we can agree now, we both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid any inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... Bob is offering a 50-50 split, but due to inflation, my $5000 is actually only worth $4500 to me in this round. Since Bob rejected my initial offer which was fairly reasonable, and given that future rounds will only decrease the value of my share further, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in later rounds.
