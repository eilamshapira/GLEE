"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I get 600k and you get 400k. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 5%
3. While 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, it's not terribly unfair
4. Rejecting means the next pool would be $950,000

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, as even with the 5% reduction, I could propose a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but not too aggressive to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's better than losing value to inflation by continuing to negotiate.""}"
