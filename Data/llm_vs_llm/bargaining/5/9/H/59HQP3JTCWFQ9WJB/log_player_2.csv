"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.
2. If I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round.
3. The money doesn't lose value for me due to inflation (0% effect).
4. This is a decent offer, but I could potentially get more by making a counter-proposal.
5. However, Alice might reject my counter-proposal, leading to further rounds and uncertainty.

Given that:
- The offer gives me a substantial amount ($400,000)
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable proposal from me
- Further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome
- The first offer is often a good indicator of the negotiation range

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being diplomatic:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both walk away equally satisfied.""}

This proposal is strategic because:
1. It's a perfectly fair split that's hard to argue against morally
2. It improves my position from the previous offer
3. The message is cordial and appeals to fairness
4. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to negotiate
5. If Alice rejects this, she might appear unreasonable"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money!  I'll meet you in the middle, but we need to close this deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000
2. I now know that Alice is affected by inflation (9.75% loss since round 1)
3. Her $550,000 is actually worth about $496,375 to her due to inflation
4. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $450,000 maintains full value
5. Alice's message suggests she's concerned about the inflation impact
6. She's moved significantly from her initial position

Given that:
- Alice is under inflation pressure while I'm not
- She's showing willingness to compromise
- Further rounds will decrease her money's value even more
- I could try for more, but she might become more defensive
- This is a significant improvement from her first offer

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is good enough considering my strategic advantage, and continuing might risk losing this favorable position."
