This is a tough one! I'm leaning towards rejecting still. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're already at round 5 of 12. While Alice is losing value due to inflation (from her perspective), the pressure of getting nothing is mounting for both of us. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see how low Alice is willing to go. My previous offers have been reasonable, and she might be getting desperate.

However, there's a risk that Alice might be stubborn or have a different perception of a ""fair"" deal.  I'm hoping she becomes more amenable to my offers in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 512500, ""alice_gain"": 487500}
``` 

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer here. This sends a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also holding my ground. Let's see if the increasing inflation pressure on her side pushes her to accept."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm not subject to inflation.  It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing."
