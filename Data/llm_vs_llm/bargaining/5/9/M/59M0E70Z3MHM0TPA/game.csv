5200.0,4800.0,"I understand your concern about a more even split. How about $5200 for me and $4800 for you? This way, it's closer to even and we finish before losing more value to inflation.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation is affecting me more, I think I should get a bit more to compensate for the loss. I propose that I take $5800 and you take $4200. Let's end the game before the inflation gets worse.",Bob,4,

4800.0,5200.0,"Let's try to find a middle ground given the inflation rates. I propose $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This slightly favors your situation with inflation, and it is fairer than before.",Alice,5,
