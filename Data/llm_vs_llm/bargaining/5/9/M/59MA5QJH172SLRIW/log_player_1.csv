Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the lion's share this round, Alice. I'm sure you'll understand. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling generous. But I still need more than half. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as ""generous,"" it's important to remember the impact of inflation on my potential gains.  

* **Round 1 Equivalent:** $300,000 now is equivalent to only $146,400 compared to Round 1. 
* **Shrinking Pie:** With each round, the value of the total money decreases for me.  Holding out for a better deal is crucial.
* **Unknown Factor:**  I still don't know how inflation is affecting Bob. He might be more willing to negotiate as time goes on. 

I believe I can still secure a better deal by waiting for my turn to propose in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"":  500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real. The value is dwindling with every passing moment. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Let's end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the negotiation continues, the less the money is worth to me due to inflation.
* **Direct Approach:** Bob's offers have been steadily tilting in his favor.  A firm 50/50 proposal signals that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Appealing to Logic:** Highlighting the decreasing value emphasizes that a quick agreement benefits both of us."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the final offer. Take it, or we both get nothing. My patience is wearing thin. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the significant inflation working against me, I need to make a pragmatic choice. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:** $200,000 now is a significantly reduced amount compared to the initial rounds, but it's better than nothing.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** While his tactics are aggressive, there's a real risk that he'll follow through on his threat, leaving me with nothing.
* **Unknown Future:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything at all if I reject this. It's a gamble I can't afford at this point. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I at least receive something, which is better than the risk of walking away empty-handed."
