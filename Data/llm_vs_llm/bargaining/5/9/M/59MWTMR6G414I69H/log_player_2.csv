"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, the actual value of the offer for Bob is now:

4500 * (1 - 0.36) = 4500 * 0.64 = 2880

And for Alice:

5500 * (1 - 0.0975) = 5500 * 0.9025 = 4963.75

So, taking inflation into account, the offer is essentially:

# Bob gain: 2880
# Alice gain: 4963.75

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation, the actual value of the money for Bob is now worth 51.84% less than in the first round.

So, if Bob wants to ensure a fair split in real value, he should ask for more than half of the money.
