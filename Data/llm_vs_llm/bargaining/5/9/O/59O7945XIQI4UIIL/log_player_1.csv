"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation is only affecting me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

I'm offering Bob $400,000. I'm keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm prioritizing securing a reasonable amount early, given the inflation that I am affected by. I consider that offering Bob 40% of the initial amount is a fair starting point, increasing the probability that he accepts the offer."
