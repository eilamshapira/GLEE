Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 5%), we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing a 55-45 split that's still fair but acknowledges our different positions. This way we both walk away with a good outcome without risking further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
