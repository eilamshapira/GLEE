"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. 50-50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation factors. A 50-50 split gives me $5,000 now, which is fair in absolute terms. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases 5% for me and 20% for Alice.

The offer is reasonable, but since inflation affects Alice more significantly than me (20% vs 5%), I might have more leverage in later rounds. However, there's also risk in prolonging negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 5%), we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing a 55-45 split that's still fair but acknowledges our different positions. This way we both walk away with a good outcome without risking further depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but a 55-45 split is too steep. Let's compromise at 48-52. This way, we both acknowledge the inflation but still keep it relatively fair. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's counteroffer. She's now offering me $5,200, which is slightly less than my previous offer but still better than her initial 50-50 split. 

Given that:
1. Inflation affects Alice much more severely (36% loss already vs my 9.75%)
2. We've already used 3 of our 12 rounds
3. Her offer is reasonably fair
4. Further delays would reduce both our payouts

This seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges my slightly stronger position while still being fair.
