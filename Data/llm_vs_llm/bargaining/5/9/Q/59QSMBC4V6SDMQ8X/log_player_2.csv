"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6000, you get $4000.  It's in your best interest to accept before inflation eats into your share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $8000 * 0.8 = $6400
   * But Alice would likely reject an extremely unfair offer

While the offer isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable starting point. If I reject, I'll lose 20% purchasing power, and Alice has no inflation pressure, giving her a stronger negotiating position.
