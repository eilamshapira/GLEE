"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

60-40 split in Alice's favor is not a very balanced proposal. Given that rejecting means I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be reduced by 20%, I should calculate:

If I reject:
- Total pot next round: $80
- I could propose a more favorable split
- Even a 50-50 split would give me $40, same as current offer
- I could propose getting more than 50%

However, if I keep rejecting, the pot will keep shrinking and we might both end up with less. The current offer of $40 is not terrible.

I'll reject this time to try for a better split next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is now my turn to propose, I'll aim for a more favorable split but not too extreme to increase chances of acceptance. Since the pot is now worth $80 (due to 20% inflation), I need to be strategic.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which would still leave Alice with a decent amount.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'll add a brief explanation: ""I propose a 60-40 split which is fair and gives us both a substantial portion."""
