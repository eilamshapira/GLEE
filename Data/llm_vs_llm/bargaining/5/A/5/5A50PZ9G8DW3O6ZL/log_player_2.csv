"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering a 40/60 split in her favor
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. The current offer gives me $4000, while if I wait one round, even a perfect $5000/5000 split would only be worth $4750 to me due to inflation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, accepting now gives me a guaranteed $4000, and waiting would likely result in less value due to inflation, even if I get a better nominal split.
