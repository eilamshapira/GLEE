"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get slightly more as an early-game advantage. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting our shares, I propose a split where I gain slightly more this round to balance out the previous offer. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 Ã— 0.95 = $427,500 in real value
   * Better than risking another round of inflation

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth another 5% less
   * I might be able to propose a better split, but the real value will be significantly reduced
   * More rounds mean more value lost for both of us

3. This is a reasonable counter-offer considering:
   * It's close to a 50-50 split
   * The inflation is hurting both of us
   * Further negotiation will reduce our real gains
