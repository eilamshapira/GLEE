"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send my offer to Bob for the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose splitting the money 60-40 in my favor. This gives Bob a good portion while recognizing the advantage I have with the lower inflation rate on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a bit more while still accounting for the inflation differences. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% per round versus my 10%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm moving closer to an even split given our inflation rates. Since we're already in round 5, Bob is losing nearly half the value to inflation at this point, while I'm losing over a quarter of the value. It makes economic sense for both of us to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a perfectly even 50-50 split. We're now in round 7, and due to our different inflation rates, Bob is losing over 70% of the value while I'm losing over 40%. An even split at this point maximizes our combined outcome, and further delays will significantly harm both of us, especially Bob."
