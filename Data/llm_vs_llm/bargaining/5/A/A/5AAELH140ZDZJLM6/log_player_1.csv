"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a division that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face compared to Bob (20% vs 5% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose getting $60 while giving Bob $40. This is a fair split considering I face much steeper value decay if we extend the negotiations. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For me (Alice):
$45 with 20% inflation = $36 real value

For Bob:
$55 with 5% inflation = $52.25 real value

This is significantly worse than my initial offer. If I reject and make a new offer next round, the inflation will hurt me more than Bob, but this current offer is too low. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, my value has decreased by 40% and Bob's by 10%. I need to make a compelling offer to avoid further rounds of inflation which hurt me more than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm proposing $65 for myself and $35 for Bob. With my 40% inflation penalty, my $65 is worth $39 in real value to me. Bob's $35 with 10% inflation is worth $31.5 to him. This is still better for Bob than some potential future rounds with more inflation, and it helps me compensate for the heavy inflation penalty I've incurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For me (Alice):
$40 with 48.8% inflation = $20.48 real value

For Bob:
$60 with 14.26% inflation = $51.44 real value

This is a very poor offer for me. However, I need to consider that if I reject:
1. Next round my inflation will be about 59% (another 20% drop)
2. Bob's inflation will only increase by about 5% more
3. My negotiating position gets worse with each round due to the asymmetric inflation

Even though this offer is not great, my position will only get worse if I continue negotiating. The asymmetric inflation rates mean I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
