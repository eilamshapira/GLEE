"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that acknowledges both the time pressure and the inflation factor affecting me. Since I'm losing 10% value each round, I should aim for a fair but decisive first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable balance that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, while still offering Bob a substantial portion. This offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk going to the next round, where although he could propose a better split for himself, the delay would reduce the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfavorable for me. With the 10% inflation penalty, I would only get $27 in effective value (30 * 0.9), while Bob would get $70. I'll reject and make a new proposal in the next round, even though I'll face a 20% total inflation penalty then. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm now facing a 20% inflation penalty on my share, I need to adjust my strategy. Any amount I receive will be worth only 80% of its nominal value to me.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my nominal share to 65 to compensate for the inflation effect (65 * 0.8 = 52 in effective value for me). This still leaves Bob with $35, which is a reasonable amount. If Bob rejects this, he needs to consider that further delays will continue to reduce the effective value of my share, making it harder to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 27.1% inflation penalty, I would get $29.16 in effective value (40 * 0.729), while Bob gets $60. While this isn't ideal, if I reject and continue to the next round:
1. I'll face a ~35% inflation penalty
2. Even if I propose a higher split in my favor, Bob is likely to reject again
3. We're already in round 4 of 12, and the inflation penalty is getting serious

It's better to secure this amount now than risk getting even less value in later rounds or potentially nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within 12 rounds."
