"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. My money is worth 10% less now, meaning I'll actually be getting the equivalent of 900,000 * (my_share) if I were to convert it back to the worth of round 1. In this scenario, I'm being offered $450,000. My worth, relative to the original value, is $450,000 / 0.9 = $500,000.

Since I'm only getting $450,000 (worth of $500,000 in round 1), but this offer is still more than what I'd get in the next round, I should accept.
