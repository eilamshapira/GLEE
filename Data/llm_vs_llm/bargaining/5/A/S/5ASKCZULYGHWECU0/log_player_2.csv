"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you rejected the even split, I'm proposing a bit more for me this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Taking a deal significantly worse than an even split after only two rounds, even with inflation, is a bad strategy. I need to show Alice I'm willing to play a longer game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be reasonable. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting further apart. I'm willing to take a bit more this time, but I hope we can end this soon. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting now is the most logical choice, even if it's not ideal."
