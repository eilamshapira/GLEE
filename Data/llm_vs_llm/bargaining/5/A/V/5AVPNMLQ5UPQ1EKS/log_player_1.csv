"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose you get $200,000 and I keep $800,000. Accepting now avoids any inflation loss for both of us (especially on my side). Looking forward to your prompt agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This is a much more equitable distribution than your initial offer. Consider it carefully before accepting. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
