""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that with inflation, waiting costs me 10% each round, so it's better for both of us to agree early. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover.""}"

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given that I'm now making the proposal. Let's settle this quickly to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see the impact inflation is having on you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 50-50 split. This is a fair and equal division that benefits us both, considering the urgency to settle before the money loses more value for you. Let's agree on this and end the game.

# Bob gain: 50
