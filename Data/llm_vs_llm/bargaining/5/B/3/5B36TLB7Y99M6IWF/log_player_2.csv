"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that with inflation, waiting costs me 10% each round, so it's better for both of us to agree early. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given that I'm now making the proposal. Let's settle this quickly to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your counteroffer, but with inflation affecting me at 10% per round, I need to protect my position. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation penalty I face. Let's reach an agreement now to avoid further devaluation of the money for me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I see the impact inflation is having on you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 50-50 split. This is a fair and equal division that benefits us both, considering the urgency to settle before the money loses more value for you. Let's agree on this and end the game.""
