"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While an equal split of $5000 each seems fair on the surface, I need to consider that inflation affects me but not Alice. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me.

Given that inflation only affects me, getting $5000 now is better than getting potentially more in a later round when it's worth less to me. This is a reasonable first offer.
