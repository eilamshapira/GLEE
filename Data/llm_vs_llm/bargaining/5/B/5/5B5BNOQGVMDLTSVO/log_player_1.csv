Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}

I'm accepting Bob's offer, though not ideal.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly each round. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for me. There's a good chance his next offer will be even less favorable. 
* **""Final Compromise"":**  This phrasing suggests he might be less flexible in future rounds.

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now avoids further losses due to inflation and the risk of an even worse deal."
