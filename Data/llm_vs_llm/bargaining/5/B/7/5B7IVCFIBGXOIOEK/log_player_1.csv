"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split 55-45. It's crucial we agree quickly because of the inflation, and this offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is too favorable for Bob, and even with inflation, I can still make a better offer in the next round. I'll propose something more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split my way. With inflation affecting both of us, we need to reach an agreement soon, and this is a balanced offer that works for both parties.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm proposing 52-48.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that inflation is eroding the value. Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation is starting to significantly impact both our potential gains, and this split is reasonably fair. It's better to secure this deal now than risk further value erosion through more rounds of negotiation."
