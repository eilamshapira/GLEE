"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split my way. With inflation affecting both of us, we need to reach an agreement soon, and this is a balanced offer that works for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's the same split I offered in Round 2.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** While Alice claims inflation affects us both, I'm the only one explicitly experiencing the devaluation. Her offer suggests she might be less impacted by inflation than I am. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Time is working against me more than her. By rejecting, I'm increasing the pressure for a more favorable deal in later rounds. 

I need to aim for a better split in the upcoming rounds to compensate for the inflation impact on my end."

This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that inflation is eroding the value. Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
