Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, accepting $35 is less than the potential $44 I could gain if Alice accepts my previous offer of $55 (with the 36% inflation factored in).  I need to try and push Alice closer to a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 

This is my final offer. If Alice rejects this, she is risking getting even less in further rounds as inflation eats away at my potential gains, making me less likely to accept anything other than an even split."
