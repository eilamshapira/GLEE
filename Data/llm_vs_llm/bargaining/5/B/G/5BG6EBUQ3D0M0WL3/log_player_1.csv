"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I'll send my offer in the specified JSON format. Given the inflation, I need to try and secure a reasonable amount for myself early.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think about this. If I reject, the value of the money will decrease again.

My current value of money is 80% of the original. Bob is offering me $50. That means I'm effectively getting $50 * 0.8 = $40 in real terms.

If I reject, the value drops to 64% of the original. I don't know Bob's inflation rate, so I need to make a decision based on my own diminishing returns. $40 is a decent amount considering the circumstances.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
