"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account Bob's 20% per round inflation penalty. Since Bob faces declining value in later rounds, I'll offer a reasonable split now.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair offer considering Bob's money will be worth less if he rejects and we move to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $450,000, which has full value for me
2. Bob wants $550,000, which is actually worth $440,000 to him due to 20% inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 20%
4. We still have many rounds left, so I have leverage to get a better deal
5. $450,000 is less than my initial offer, and I believe I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob has rejected my first offer and I rejected his, I'll adjust my strategy. Bob's money is now worth 40% less to him in this round, so he should be more motivated to accept a reasonable offer now.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose I get $650,000 and Bob gets $350,000. This $350,000 is actually worth only $210,000 to Bob now due to 40% inflation. If he rejects this, his value will decrease even further in the next round, so this should be more appealing to him than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $500,000, which has full value for me
2. Bob wants $500,000, which is actually worth only $256,000 to him due to 48.8% inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 5 where I can make a new offer, and Bob's value will decrease even more
4. We have many rounds left, and Bob's position is getting weaker due to compounding inflation
5. $500,000 is still less than what I believe I can get, given Bob's worsening position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 59% less to him (compounding 20% inflation over 4 rounds), and he's still trying to negotiate, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. Due to inflation, Bob's $300,000 is only worth about $123,000 to him now. If he rejects this, his value will decrease even further, making future negotiations even less favorable for him. This should be an increasingly attractive offer given his rapidly declining purchasing power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $550,000, which has full value for me
2. Bob wants $450,000, which is actually worth only $147,465 to him due to 67.23% inflation
3. We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob's value continues to decrease rapidly
4. Bob's position is getting increasingly desperate due to the compounding inflation
5. $550,000 is still significantly less than my last offer of $700,000, and given Bob's weakening position, I can likely get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Bob's money is now worth about 73.8% less (compounding 20% inflation over 6 rounds). His continued rejection of higher offers shows he might be hoping I'll cave, but his position is becoming increasingly untenable.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. Due to inflation, Bob's $200,000 is only worth about $52,400 to him now. If he continues to reject, his value will decrease even more drastically. Given that we're in round 7 of 12, and his money is losing value rapidly, this should be becoming a more appealing offer despite the lower nominal amount."
