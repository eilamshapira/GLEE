"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While an even split seems fair, I need to consider the 10% inflation effect on my gains if I reject. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced to 90$. Given this information, accepting 50$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more in later rounds after inflation.
