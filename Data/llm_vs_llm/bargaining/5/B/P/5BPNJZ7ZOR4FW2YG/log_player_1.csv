Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,""bob_gain"": 50,""message"": ""Let's split it evenly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 5% value each round, this split is actually fair when accounting for the time value of money. You'll get 45$ now, which is worth more than 50$ in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
