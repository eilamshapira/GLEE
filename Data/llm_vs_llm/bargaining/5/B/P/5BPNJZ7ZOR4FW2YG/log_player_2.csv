"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate.
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round where Alice's portion would be worth 5% less to her.
4. This gives me negotiating leverage to potentially get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a more favorable split, considering the inflation factor.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, I can use this to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 5% value each round, this split is actually fair when accounting for the time value of money. You'll get 45$ now, which is worth more than 50$ in future rounds.""}"
