"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
3. Alice has no depreciation penalty, so she has less pressure to accept early
4. $4,000 now is better than potentially getting more later due to the depreciation
5. However, 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems a bit unfair given we're starting fresh

I'll reject this offer since we're in round 1 and I can make a counter-proposal for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that time pressure affects me more than Alice:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid the depreciation by agreeing early.""}

My reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable
2. If Alice rejects, the next round will have my money worth 20% less
3. This proposal shows I'm willing to be fair rather than greedy
4. Since Alice has no depreciation penalty, she might be more willing to accept a fair split now rather than negotiating further"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the depreciation, I think this split is more favorable for both of us, don't wait for further losses 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $3,500, which due to 19% depreciation is actually worth $2,835 to me
2. This is worse than her initial offer of $4,000
3. If I reject, next round will have 29% depreciation for me
4. Alice seems to be leveraging my time pressure by offering even less
5. She's likely to continue this strategy as she has no depreciation penalty

However, given the steep depreciation rate and the fact that I need to act quickly:
- Next round, even if I got $4,000, it would be worth only $2,840 to me
- Alice knows she has the advantage and is unlikely to offer better terms
- Further negotiations might lead to even worse outcomes for me

While this isn't ideal, the depreciation makes waiting risky.
