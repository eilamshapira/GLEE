"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game of dividing $100, considering that there's an inflation effect of 10% each round for me.

For my first offer, I want to propose a fair split that Bob is likely to accept, since waiting could cost me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the $100, which seems fair to both parties. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease for me due to inflation, so I believe this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Bob has rejected my fair 50-50 split and is now offering me $45 while taking $55.

For me, due to inflation, money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. If I reject and we go to round 3, it will be worth 20% less.

For Bob, money is apparently worth 20% less in this round, which explains why he's asking for more.

If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $45 with a 10% inflation penalty, so it's effectively worth $40.50 to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, inflation will reduce my gains further, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer.
