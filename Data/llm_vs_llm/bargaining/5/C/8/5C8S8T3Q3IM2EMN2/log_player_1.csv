"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if negotiations continue. Since I'd lose 10% value each round if Bob declines, I'll aim for a slightly higher portion while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small buffer against potential inflation if we need more rounds. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it."
