"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet. 
Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my 4500$ would effectively become 3600$.

While the split isn't perfectly equal, getting 4500$ now is better than risking a lower effective value in the next round, even if I could potentially negotiate for more.
