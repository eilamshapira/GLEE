"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite unbalanced, giving her 70% of the total amount. Additionally, I need to consider the impact of inflation in future rounds. If I reject and we go to round 2, the total value for me decreases by 20%, while for Alice it only decreases by 5%. Given this asymmetric inflation, waiting too long will disadvantage me more than Alice.

However, I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, even accounting for some inflation loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more equitable offer, accounting for the inflation impact. Since the money is now worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice, I need to be strategic with my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I get 55% and Alice gets 45%. This is more balanced than her initial proposal, and considering Alice would face a 5% inflation penalty if she rejects, this offer should be reasonable for her. It gives her a decent portion while allowing me to recover more than what was initially offered."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's new offer gives me 40% of the total, which is better than her initial 30% offer. However, I need to carefully consider the inflation effects.

At this point, the money is worth 36% less to me than in round 1. If I reject and we go to round 4, it would be worth even less (about 49% less than round 1). Meanwhile, Alice is only facing 9.75% inflation currently, which would increase to about 14.3% in the next round.

Given this significant asymmetric inflation that disadvantages me more severely, and the improved offer from Alice, accepting now is likely better than continuing negotiations where my position weakens more rapidly than Alice's.
