"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$, which means I would get 40% while she gets 60%. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. The risk is that Alice might then reject my offer, and the negotiation could continue with potentially worse outcomes.

Given that 400,000$ is still a significant sum and that prolonging the negotiation carries risk, I will accept this offer.
