8333.33,1666.67,"Hi Bob, as we're both aware the value of money drops with each passing round – 5% for me and 20% for you. By accepting this first‐round offer, you'll secure $1666.67 immediately rather than risk even steeper losses later. I’m proposing that I take $8333.33 and you get $1666.67. I believe this division is fair given our different discount factors, and I hope you agree that acting now is in both our best interests.",Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I understand the money loses value over time, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split - $6000 for you and $4000 for me. This ensures a fairer outcome given the depreciation we both face. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer. Considering the depreciation factors – my share would have an effective value of $6000 × 0.95 = $5700 in round 1 dollars, and if I were to hold out for a counterproposal in the next round, the further discount would leave me with a significantly smaller effective amount. I believe that accepting your 60/40 split now is in both our best interests to preserve value, so let's close this deal!",Alice,2,accept
