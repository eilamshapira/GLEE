"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we're both aware the value of money drops with each passing round – 5% for me and 20% for you. By accepting this first‐round offer, you'll secure $1666.67 immediately rather than risk even steeper losses later. I’m proposing that I take $8333.33 and you get $1666.67. I believe this division is fair given our different discount factors, and I hope you agree that acting now is in both our best interests. 
# Bob gain: 1666.67 
# Alice gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice makes a compelling argument, her offer significantly undervalues my share, especially considering the rapid depreciation of the money for me. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I understand the money loses value over time, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split - $6000 for you and $4000 for me. This ensures a fairer outcome given the depreciation we both face. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}"
