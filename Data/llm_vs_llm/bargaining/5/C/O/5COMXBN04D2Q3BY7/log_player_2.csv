"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $40 and she gets $60 out of the $100.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me (so the $100 becomes worth $95 to me) and by 20% for Alice (so it becomes worth only $80 to her).

Given the significant inflation penalty Alice faces (20%), I'm in a stronger negotiating position if we go to another round. I could likely propose a better split for myself in the next round, and Alice would have incentive to accept because the money is rapidly losing value for her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 2, I'll consider the inflation effects strategically. Alice faces a much steeper inflation penalty (20% per round) compared to my 5%, which puts me in a stronger position.

If Alice rejects my offer now, she'll face a 20% reduction in the money's value in the next round, meaning the $100 would only be worth $80 to her. This gives me leverage to propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it rational for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives Alice $40 now, which is better than risking further rounds where her share would be worth even less due to her high inflation rate. The division is fair considering our different inflation rates and the game dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering a 50-50 split ($50 each). Due to inflation:
- For me, my $50 is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so equivalent to about $45.13 of original value
- For Alice, her $50 is worth 36% less than in round 1, so equivalent to about $32 of original value

If I reject this offer and we go to round 4:
- My inflation would increase to approximately 14.75% (another 5%)
- Alice's inflation would increase to approximately 56% (another 20%)

Given that:
1. Alice has significantly improved her offer from $40 to $50 for me
2. Alice is already facing substantial inflation penalties
3. Further rounds will continue to erode the total value for both of us
4. A 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms
