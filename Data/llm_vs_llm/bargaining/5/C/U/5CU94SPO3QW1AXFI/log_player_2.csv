"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the inflation effect. She's offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me.

Given this information, I should carefully evaluate whether accepting $40 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round but with the 20% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer considering the inflation effect I'm experiencing. Since the money is now worth 20% less to me in this round, I should aim for a fair division that accounts for this.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm experiencing 20% inflation each round, so I need a slightly higher amount to compensate for the decreased value. This is a fair split considering my inflation constraint.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your inflation, this is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering my inflation situation.

In round 1, Alice offered me $40. I rejected it.
Now in round 3, Alice is offering me $43, but with 36% inflation for me, this $43 is actually worth $43 Ã— (1-0.36) = $27.52 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even higher inflation (likely around 50% from the original value), making any potential gains worth significantly less to me.

Since Alice's current offer of $43 (worth $27.52 to me after inflation) is worse than her initial offer of $40, and the situation will only get worse with more rounds due to increasing inflation, I should accept this offer.
