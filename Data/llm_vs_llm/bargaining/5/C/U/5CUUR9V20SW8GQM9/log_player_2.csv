"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which means she would get 90% of the total amount. While $100,000 is a significant sum, the division seems quite uneven.

Since this is only the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I believe I can propose a more balanced division if I reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
