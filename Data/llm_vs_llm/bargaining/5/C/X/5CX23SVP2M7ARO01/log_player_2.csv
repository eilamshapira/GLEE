"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly! I'm offering you 10% and keeping the rest. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of 10% ($1,000) is too low for a fair division. Since I am Bob, I will make a counter-proposal in the next round. Even with the 5% inflation penalty per round, I can propose a more equitable split that would still give me a better outcome than accepting just $1,000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally and can conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
