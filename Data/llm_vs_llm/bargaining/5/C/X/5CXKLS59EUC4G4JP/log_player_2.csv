"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that Alice rejected a highly favorable offer last time.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Alice gets $40. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a good portion while still leaving Alice with a significant amount. I need to be mindful that if Alice rejects this, we'll go to another round where the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept $40 now, due to the 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about $36.10 to me
2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
   - The inflation will increase to about 15%
   - I could make another offer, but Alice has shown she won't accept offers too favorable to me
   - We might end up in a cycle where the money becomes worth less and less to me

Given this, I should accept this offer now before inflation reduces the value further.
