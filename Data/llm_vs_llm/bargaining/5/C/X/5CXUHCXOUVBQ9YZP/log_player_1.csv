"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000, keeping in mind that money loses 10% value for me and 20% value for Bob each round we delay.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion of the money ($480,000) while keeping slightly more for myself ($520,000). This is a fair split given the circumstances, and accepting now means we both get maximum value since inflation will reduce our gains in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're in a pattern where we're each asking for slightly more than half. Let me propose a perfectly even split that should be acceptable to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a completely fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $500,000. Since inflation is affecting both of us with each passing round (10% for me, 20% for Bob), it makes sense to agree quickly rather than continuing to haggle over small differences, as we both lose value with each rejection."
