550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose 52% for me, 48% for you. With inflation, I need a slightly larger share. This is a good deal for both of us!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, I understand you want more. However, even with the 15% inflation you face, my offer of 400000$ is still worth 340000$ to you. This is a fair offer given the circumstances, and we should conclude this quickly before inflation reduces the value further for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I am offering you 450000$. Inflation is hurting me, and I need to consider that. Let's finalize this with 55% for me and 45% for you. We are running out of time.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, with the current inflation rate of 27.1% affecting your gains, you need to be realistic. Even with this split, you'll get about 255000$ in effective value. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce your value even further. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, inflation is destroying my gains. I need 60% to make this worthwhile. This is the best offer you'll get. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the current inflation rate of 40.95% affecting your gains, your aggressive stance isn't helping either of us. Even with a 300000$ offer, any further delay will only reduce your effective value more. This offer gives you about 177000$ in real value now - if you wait, it will only get worse. Accept this and we can both walk away with something meaningful.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I need 650000$. Inflation is killing me. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, with inflation at 52.17%, your last demand of 650000$ would only be worth 310895$ to you in real terms. My offer of 250000$ may seem small, but any further delay will devastate your purchasing power even more. We only have a few rounds left - let's be rational and conclude this now before inflation erodes your value completely.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I need 700000$. This is my absolute final offer. You're being unreasonable. Take it now!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, let's be completely clear about the math. With 61.26% inflation, your last demand of 700000$ would only be worth 271180$ to you. We have only one round left after this. My offer of 200000$ might seem low, but any further delay will only destroy more of your purchasing power. Take this offer now, or we risk both walking away with nothing in the final round.",Alice,11,
