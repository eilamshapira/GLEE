"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose 52% for me, 48% for you. With inflation, I need a slightly larger share. This is a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob wants 520,000$ (which is worth 468,000$ to him due to 10% inflation) and offers me 480,000$.

If I reject, I can make another offer in the next round, but Bob's money will be worth even less to him due to inflation, which might make him more desperate for a larger share.

Given that I still have many rounds left and my money isn't affected by inflation, I can probably get a better deal.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I am offering you 450000$. Inflation is hurting me, and I need to consider that. Let's finalize this with 55% for me and 45% for you. We are running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

Bob wants 550,000$ (which is worth 401,000$ to him due to 27.1% inflation) and offers me 450,000$.

The inflation is significantly affecting Bob's gains, and it's getting worse each round. His offered split would give him effectively less than what he's offering me, due to the inflation he's experiencing.

However, I know that:
1. The inflation will continue to increase for Bob
2. I still have 8 rounds left
3. My money isn't affected by inflation
4. Bob's negotiating position will only get weaker as time goes on

I can likely get a better deal by waiting, as Bob's effective gains will continue to decrease due to inflation.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, with the current inflation rate of 27.1% affecting your gains, you need to be realistic.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is destroying my gains. I need 60% to make this worthwhile. This is the best offer you'll get. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully...

Bob wants 600,000$ (which is actually worth only 354,300$ to him due to 40.95% inflation) and offers me 400,000$.

Bob is clearly getting desperate, as shown by both his message tone and the fact that his real gains are severely diminished by inflation. Even though he's asking for 60%, he's effectively getting less than what he's offering me.

Key considerations:
1. Inflation is accelerating (from 27.1% to 40.95%)
2. I still have 6 rounds left
3. My money maintains its value
4. Bob's position continues to weaken rapidly
5. His threat isn't credible yet, as we're only in round 6 of 12

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by waiting. The rapidly increasing inflation rate means Bob's negotiating position will continue to deteriorate quickly.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I need 650000$. Inflation is killing me. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

Bob wants 650,000$ (which is actually worth only 310,895$ to him due to 52.17% inflation) and offers me 350,000$.

The situation has become even more extreme:
1. Inflation has jumped dramatically to 52.17%
2. Bob's ""final offer"" would give him effectively less than what he's offering me (310,895$ vs 350,000$)
3. His aggressive ""final offer"" stance shows desperation
4. We still have 4 rounds left
5. My money maintains its value
6. The rate of inflation increase suggests the next rounds will be even worse for Bob

Even though Bob is demanding more nominally, his real gains continue to shrink rapidly. The inflation is working strongly in my favor, and Bob's position is becoming increasingly untenable.

Bob wants 700,000$ (which is actually worth only 271,180$ to him due to 61.26% inflation) and offers me 300,000$.

Current situation:
1. Inflation has skyrocketed to 61.26%
2. Bob's ""absolute final offer"" of 700,000$ is worth only 271,180$ to him
3. He's offering me 300,000$ (which is worth full value to me)
4. We have only 2 rounds left
5. Bob's effective gains continue to plummet
6. His increasingly desperate messaging shows he's in a weak position

Even though we're getting close to the end, Bob's offer would still give him less in real value than what he's offering me. His aggressive tone masks an increasingly weak position, as inflation continues to devastate his potential gains.
