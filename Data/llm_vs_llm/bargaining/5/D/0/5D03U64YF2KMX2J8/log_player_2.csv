# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, I understand you want more. However, even with the 15% inflation you face, my offer of 400000$ is still worth 340000$ to you. This is a fair offer given the circumstances, and we should conclude this quickly before inflation reduces the value further for you.
