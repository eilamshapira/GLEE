Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is a fair split given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right about being reasonable, accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less than if we split evenly after another round or two. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share while there's still a decent amount of value left."
