52.0,48.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is better than waiting. This split gives you almost half the money without any loss to inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I rejected your offer because I think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more. If you accept now, we both avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I've considered your counteroffer and am proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and time is working against both of us with our inflation rates. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less due to inflation. A 50-50 split right now is the fairest solution.",Alice,3,
