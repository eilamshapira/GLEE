"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob in Round 1 that considers the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is better than waiting. This split gives you almost half the money without any loss to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more. If you accept now, we both avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your counteroffer and am proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and time is working against both of us with our inflation rates. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less due to inflation. A 50-50 split right now is the fairest solution.""}"
