Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, it's still tilted in her favor considering the inflation is hitting me harder. I'll hold out a bit longer hoping for a better offer or to make a more compelling counter-offer."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is starting to hurt, but Alice's offer is getting worse for me! It seems she might be less affected by inflation than I am. I need to push for a better split soon before the money value diminishes further."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The writing is on the wall. Alice is barely budging, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains.  This offer is far from ideal, but it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in a few rounds."
