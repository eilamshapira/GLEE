525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where you get $475000 and I get $525000. This is actually fair because money is worth 5% less to you each round, so if you reject this and we wait, we both lose value. This split maximizes our combined utility.",Alice,1,

520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about maximizing utility, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split. How about we try $480000 for me and $520000 for you?  It's still a good deal for you considering the depreciation.",Bob,2,
