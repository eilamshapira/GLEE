"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer that considers the inflation factor for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where you get $475,000 and I get $525,000. This is actually fair because money is worth 5% less to you each round, so if you reject this and we wait, we both lose value. This split maximizes our combined utility.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about maximizing utility, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split. How about we try $480000 for me and $520000 for you?  It's still a good deal for you considering the depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
