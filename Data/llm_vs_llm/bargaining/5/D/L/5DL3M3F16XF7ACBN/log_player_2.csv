"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where you get $475000 and I get $525000. This is actually fair because money is worth 5% less to you each round, so if you reject this and we wait, we both lose value. This split maximizes our combined utility. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
