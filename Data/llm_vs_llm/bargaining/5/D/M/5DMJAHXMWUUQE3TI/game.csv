60.0,40.0,Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for both of us to avoid the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to the middle and still a decent deal considering the inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation is hitting you too, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Look, Alice, this back and forth is pointless. We both lose out with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. Let's end this here.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
