Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the game, considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. Since inflation will affect me with each passing round (reducing the value by 5% per round), it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division is fair and reasonable for both of us."
