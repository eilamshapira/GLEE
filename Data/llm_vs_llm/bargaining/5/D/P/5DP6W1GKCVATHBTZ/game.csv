600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, since we both face inflation but yours is higher at 20% vs my 5%, we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you 400k which is fair considering our different positions. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. Let's settle now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, you're right, we should settle quickly. But, I'm losing more money each round. I'm offering you 400k, which is still a substantial amount. If we can agree, we both walk away with something, but the longer we wait, the less we both get. Let's be smart and secure a good deal now.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider our positions rationally. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 5%, delaying hurts you much more. If we don't agree now and this continues another round, your 600k would be worth only 384k to you, while my original 400k offer would still be worth 361k to me. This 550k/450k split is a fair compromise that recognizes your higher inflation pressure. Let's finalize this deal now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
