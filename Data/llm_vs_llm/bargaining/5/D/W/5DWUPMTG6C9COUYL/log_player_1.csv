Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the amount equally to ensure fairness for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since waiting another round would make your share worth 20% less, this offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than getting $5000 next round (which would only be worth $4000 to you due to the 20% depreciation). This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
