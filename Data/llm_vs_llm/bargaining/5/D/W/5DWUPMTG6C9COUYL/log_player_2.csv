"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the amount equally to ensure fairness for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, while mine keeps its full value, I have an advantage in negotiations. If we go to the next round:
- I can offer a split that gives me more
- Whatever amount Alice gets will be worth 20% less to her
- This puts pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal

With this leverage, I should be able to get a better deal than a 50-50 split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since waiting another round would make your share worth 20% less, this offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than getting $5000 next round (which would only be worth $4000 to you due to the 20% depreciation). This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""}"
