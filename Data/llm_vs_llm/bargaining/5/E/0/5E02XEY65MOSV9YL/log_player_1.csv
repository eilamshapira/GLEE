"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more fair, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 45 for me and 55 for him, and considering the inflation that affects his gain, I'll try to make a more appealing offer for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Equal split, best for both before inflation hurts more!""}"
