"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation affecting my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share taking into account the devaluation of your share over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4,500, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $4,275
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any money I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's position is getting stronger with each round due to inflation only affecting my share
4. While the split isn't ideal, getting $4,275 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation
