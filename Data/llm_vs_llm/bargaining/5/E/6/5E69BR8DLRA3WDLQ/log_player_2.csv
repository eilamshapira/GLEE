"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $500,000 for me
2. If I reject and wait for next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * My $500,000 would become worth $400,000 in the next round
   * Even if I propose a better split for myself, the inflation penalty makes it less attractive

While a 50-50 split might seem fair, knowing that inflation will reduce my purchasing power in future rounds makes this offer quite attractive. I should accept now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
