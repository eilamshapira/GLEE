Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 40/60 split? This seems a bit more balanced, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impacts, I propose a 45/55 split to ensure a fairer distribution before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still not in my best interest to accept. The inflation is hurting him more than me, and I'm willing to bet he'll get more desperate and offer a better deal in the upcoming rounds."
