"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the value decrease due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I accept now:
- I get $400,000 at full value
- Alice gets $600,000

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But my money will be worth 20% less
- Alice's money will only be worth 5% less
- The $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 to me next round

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the inflation penalty for rejecting is quite severe for me (20% vs Alice's 5%). If I reject, I'd need to get significantly more money next round to make up for the 20% loss, and Alice would likely reject that.

Given the asymmetric inflation penalties and the decent amount offered, I'll accept.
