"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My proposal is that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think strategically here.

*   **Current Situation:** Bob's offering a 50/50 split. My money is still worth the same, but Bob's is worth 20% less to him.

*   **Future Considerations:** If I reject, I'll have to make another offer in the next round, and the value of my potential winnings *could* decrease due to inflation. I also don't know how Bob values money after inflation.

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal from my perspective, it's a decent starting point, and the risk of losing more value in future rounds is significant. I don't want to get greedy and risk ending up with nothing.
