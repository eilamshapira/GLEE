490000.0,510000.0,"Let's go with a more balanced split. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me since I face 5% inflation per round, but you still get a substantial amount. This is fair and efficient - accepting now maximizes our total value before further inflation.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"I understand we both face inflation, with yours being significantly higher at 36% per round compared to my 5%. This means delays are much costlier for you. This 55-45 split in my favor is actually generous considering our different inflation rates - if we delay further, your portion loses much more value than mine. Let's finalize now to maximize our combined value.",Bob,4,
