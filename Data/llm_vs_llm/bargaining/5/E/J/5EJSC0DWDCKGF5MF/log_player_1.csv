Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go with a more balanced split. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me since I face 5% inflation per round, but you still get a substantial amount. This is fair and efficient - accepting now maximizes our total value before further inflation.

# Bob gain: 510000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both face inflation, with yours being significantly higher at 36% per round compared to my 5%. This means delays are much costlier for you. This 55-45 split in my favor is actually generous considering our different inflation rates - if we delay further, your portion loses much more value than mine. Let's finalize now to maximize our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
