"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would receive $400,000.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to the 5% inflation, the money would be worth less to me in the next round - the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me.

If I propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd be offering myself $475,000 (50% of $950,000). This is better than the current $400,000 offer, assuming Alice accepts.

Given that I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for inflation:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, 
""alice_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Let's go with a more balanced split. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me since I face 5% inflation per round, but you still get a substantial amount. This is fair and efficient - accepting now maximizes our total value before further inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering inflation, let's meet closer to the original 60-40 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully:

Alice is now offering me $420,000, which is better than her initial $400,000 offer but less than my counter of $510,000.

Important new information: Alice faces 36% inflation per round, which is much higher than my 5% inflation. This explains why she's motivated to reach a deal.

If I reject this offer and we go to round 4:
- For me, the money would be worth about 14.75% less than round 1 (another 5% drop from current 9.75%)
- For Alice, the money would be worth about 56% less than round 1 (another 20% drop from current 36%)

This suggests Alice is under much more pressure to settle. In the next round, I could reasonably ask for a better split.

Given these inflation asymmetries and the fact that I can likely get a better deal in the next round:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I understand we both face inflation, with yours being significantly higher at 36% per round compared to my 5%. This means delays are much costlier for you. This 55-45 split in my favor is actually generous considering our different inflation rates - if we delay further, your portion loses much more value than mine. Let's finalize now to maximize our combined value.""}"
