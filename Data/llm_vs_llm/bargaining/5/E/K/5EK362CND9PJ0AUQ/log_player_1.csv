"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Bob, I’m offering you $3200 now while I keep $6800. Since any delay costs you 10% per round—the value you’d get next round will be lower—this deal guarantees you the full value now. I believe this is a fair split considering our different devaluation rates. What do you say to settling the matter immediately?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 10% devaluation per round for me, I'm making a more balanced offer. If you accept, we both get a significant amount. If not, the value for me decreases, so it's in your interest to negotiate sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for you in round 2 seems fair at first glance, I know that waiting into round 3 will allow me to propose a division that better accounts for the fact that your money will depreciate even more. Given that my share’s value remains constant while yours diminishes further with each round, I believe I can secure a more advantageous deal for myself by negotiating in the next round. Therefore, I must reject this offer.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9700, ""bob_gain"": 300, ""message"": ""Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 4—but by then your share suffers an extra 10% discount, and you'll be forced to give me almost everything because I can always wait without any loss. Accepting $300 now ensures you get a positive amount while waiting only reduces your effective value even more. I believe this is the smartest move for both of us given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your strategy, but I'm not willing to give up so much value. Given the 10% devaluation per round, my share is already significantly reduced. This offer is more reasonable, considering I've already lost nearly 20% of the potential value. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I acknowledge that your offer attempts to balance the effects of inflation, yet by accepting it, you'd be getting $4000—whose effective value is already diminished by about 27%. Meanwhile, my share remains undiminished at $6000. If we move to round 5, I get to propose a division where your share will be even more devalued (roughly 34.39% less than face value), which gives me greater leverage. For these reasons, I'm inclined to reject your offer and prepare a proposal for round 5.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6900, ""bob_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Bob, we’re now in round 5 where your money’s value is reduced to about 65.61% of its face value. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 6—but then your share will shrink further (to roughly 59.05% of face value). To spare both of us from further losses, I’m offering you $3100 now. That means you secure an effective value of about $2034, which is likely better than what you could guarantee by waiting. I believe this is a fair compromise given the discount you're facing. What do you say?""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're halfway through the rounds, and the devaluation is severely impacting my potential gain. I'm proposing an equal split, considering the diminishing value of my share. If you reject, you risk me having to make more aggressive offers in subsequent rounds to compensate for the loss. Let's split it evenly and avoid further uncertainty.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt at balance, but given that your share’s actual value is now only about 59% of its face value while mine remains intact, I believe we can both improve our outcomes by waiting another round. By moving to round 7, I can propose terms that better account for this growing disparity—terms that will ensure you’re not forced into a more drastic position later while allowing me to capture a fairer share of the current full dollars.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2710, ""bob_gain"": 7290, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 7 your money is now worth only about 53.14% of face value. If you reject this offer, you’ll propose in round 8, where—after careful backward calculation—you’d secure an effective payoff equivalent to receiving 8100 face dollars in round 8, which translates to about $3874 once discounted. By accepting this offer, you get 7290 face dollars in round 7, which at the current discount (0.531441) gives you exactly $3874 in effective value. I’m offering you exactly what you’d be able to guarantee by waiting, while I preserve as much value as possible. I believe this is the logical outcome if we’re both rational—please accept.""}"
