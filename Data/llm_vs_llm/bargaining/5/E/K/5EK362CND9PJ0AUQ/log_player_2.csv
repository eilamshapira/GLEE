"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I’m offering you $3200 now while I keep $6800. Since any delay costs you 10% per round—the value you’d get next round will be lower—this deal guarantees you the full value now. I believe this is a fair split considering our different devaluation rates. What do you say to settling the matter immediately? 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money devalues by 10% for me each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the 10% devaluation per round for me, I'm making a more balanced offer. If you accept, we both get a significant amount. If not, the value for me decreases, so it's in your interest to negotiate sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 4—but by then your share suffers an extra 10% discount, and you'll be forced to give me almost everything because I can always wait without any loss. Accepting $300 now ensures you get a positive amount while waiting only reduces your effective value even more. I believe this is the smartest move for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300 
# Alice gain: 9700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the devaluation, I need to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value for me.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your strategy, but I'm not willing to give up so much value. Given the 10% devaluation per round, my share is already significantly reduced. This offer is more reasonable, considering I've already lost nearly 20% of the potential value. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we’re now in round 5 where your money’s value is reduced to about 65.61% of its face value. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 6—but then your share will shrink further (to roughly 59.05% of face value). To spare both of us from further losses, I’m offering you $3100 now. That means you secure an effective value of about $2034, which is likely better than what you could guarantee by waiting. I believe this is a fair compromise given the discount you're facing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 3100 
# Alice gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant devaluation of my potential share, I need to make a strong offer to protect my interests.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, we're halfway through the rounds, and the devaluation is severely impacting my potential gain. I'm proposing an equal split, considering the diminishing value of my share. If you reject, you risk me having to make more aggressive offers in subsequent rounds to compensate for the loss. Let's split it evenly and avoid further uncertainty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, in round 7 your money is now worth only about 53.14% of face value. If you reject this offer, you’ll propose in round 8, where—after careful backward calculation—you’d secure an effective payoff equivalent to receiving 8100 face dollars in round 8, which translates to about $3874 once discounted. By accepting this offer, you get 7290 face dollars in round 7, which at the current discount (0.531441) gives you exactly $3874 in effective value. I’m offering you exactly what you’d be able to guarantee by waiting, while I preserve as much value as possible. I believe this is the logical outcome if we’re both rational—please accept. 
# Bob gain: 7290 
# Alice gain: 2710
