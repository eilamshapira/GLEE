"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since I want to be fair but also optimize my gain, I'll propose a slight advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging that I'm making the first move in our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is experiencing inflation while I'm not. Since his money is worth 10% less each round, I should factor this into my proposal. Let me make a slightly more balanced offer.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than my previous offer, recognizing that we should try to reach an agreement soon since inflation is affecting his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice the inflation for Bob is increasing significantly - it's now at 27.1% from the first round. Bob seems to be trying to get a better deal, but with each round, his share becomes less valuable to him due to inflation. I should propose an offer that acknowledges this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

This is a very fair offer considering that inflation isn't affecting my share but is significantly reducing the value of Bob's portion. It would be in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000
