"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $5000 for you, $5000 for me. With the risk of inflation in later rounds, settling now seems optimal. Looking forward to your thoughts, Alice. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer.

She's proposing an equal split of $5,000 each, which is fair. Since there's no inflation for me across rounds (0% as mentioned in the rules), I don't lose value by waiting. However, reaching the 12-round limit would give us both nothing, so there is some risk in rejecting perfectly fair offers.

Given that this is a fair 50-50 split and there's no strategic advantage for me to wait, I'll accept this offer.
