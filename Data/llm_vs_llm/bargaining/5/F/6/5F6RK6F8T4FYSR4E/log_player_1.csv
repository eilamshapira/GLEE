"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I need to make a proposal for dividing $10,000, considering the inflation rates. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Slightly Favorable to Me:** I'm asking for a bit more than half initially. This is because I want to start with a position that gives me some leverage, but not be so greedy that Bob immediately rejects it.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** I'm offering Bob $4500. He knows the money will be worth 10% less to him next round. Therefore, this offer needs to be tempting enough for him to consider accepting it now.
*   **Time Pressure:** We have 12 rounds. While this seems like a lot, the declining value of the money makes each round costly, especially for Bob.

I await Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has rejected my initial offer and now made a counter-offer of $5000 each. Let's analyze this, keeping inflation in mind.

*   **My perspective:** If I accept, I get $5000. If I reject, I have to make another offer next round, and I still get 100% of the money offered to me.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob's money is already worth 10% less than in Round 1. If he rejects this round, his value depreciates again.
*   **Strategic considerations:** The fact that Bob is offering an even split in Round 2 is interesting. It might indicate he's playing cautiously or trying to anchor the negotiation at $5000. However, he also knows time is against him.

Given the above analysis, I'll accept his offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to squeeze more out of Bob, the risk of further rounds, especially with his decreasing payout value, makes it less appealing. $5000 in round two isn't a bad outcome, especially considering there are 12 rounds! I am happy with a 50% split."
