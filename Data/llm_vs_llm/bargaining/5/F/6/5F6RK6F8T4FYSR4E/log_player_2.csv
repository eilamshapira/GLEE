"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't quite fair, especially considering I'll face 10% inflation in each round while she won't. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2.

Let me evaluate: $4500 now versus potentially more if I negotiate, but with the risk of diminishing returns due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation risk I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable for both of us. Since I face inflation with each passing round and you don't, this equal division recognizes our mutual interest in reaching an agreement quickly."
