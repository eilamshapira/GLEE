"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 5% value each round. Since I'm making the first offer, I should propose something fair but advantageous to me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable 60-40 split
2. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth 5% less in the next round
3. It gives Bob a significant portion while still being favorable to me"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $525,000 (which maintains its full value for me)
2. Bob keeps $475,000 (which is actually worth $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250 to him due to 5% inflation)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - My money maintains its value
   - But there's risk Bob rejects again

This is actually a reasonable offer. While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, Bob's offer gives me more than my initial proposal ($525K vs $600K), and the risk of continued negotiation might not be worth it.
