"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage, but I still want to make a reasonable offer to avoid too many rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split considering that if Bob rejects, their next round's money will be worth 10% less, so they should carefully consider accepting this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob offered me $4500, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $5500, but for them it's actually worth $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 due to 10% inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I still have 10 rounds left
4. Since I have the advantage of no inflation impact, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my first offer of 60-40 and their money is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly but still try to be reasonable to avoid too many rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I'm offering Bob $3500, which for them is worth $3500 * 0.8 = $2800 due to 20% inflation. While this might seem like I'm taking more, in real value it's more balanced since I'm accounting for Bob's inflation penalty. This is still better for Bob than letting the negotiations drag on for more rounds where their money would be worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $4200, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $5800, but for them it's actually worth $5800 * 0.729 = $4228.2 due to 27.1% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I still have 8 rounds left
4. Bob's actual value from this deal ($4228.2) is now lower than what I would get ($4200)
5. However, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting, given my stronger negotiating position due to no inflation impact

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 34.39% less (compounded 30% plus 10% this round), I'll make an offer that appears more aggressive but actually represents a fair real value considering Bob's inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

Let's break down the real value of this offer:
- My $7000 is worth full value
- Bob's $3000 is worth $3000 * 0.6561 = $1968.30 due to 34.39% inflation

While the nominal split might look uneven at 70-30, given the inflation effect on Bob's share, they should consider accepting this offer because:
1. Further delays will make their money worth even less
2. The real value gap is less extreme than it appears
3. They still get a meaningful amount in real terms"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $4000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $6000, but for them it's actually worth $6000 * 0.5905 = $3543 due to 40.95% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I still have 6 rounds left
4. Bob would actually get less real value ($3543) than I would ($4000)
5. Given that I can still make better offers and Bob's position is weakening with each round due to inflation, I should reject this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob's money now worth 46.86% less (compounded previous 40.95% plus 10% this round), I'll make an offer that reflects this reality while still giving Bob a reasonable real value to consider.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

Let's analyze the real value of this offer:
- My $7500 is worth full value
- Bob's $2500 is worth $2500 * 0.5314 = $1328.50 due to 46.86% inflation

While this 75-25 split might look aggressive, I'm making this offer because:
1. Bob's continued rejections are significantly hurting their own position due to inflation
2. The real value gap is less extreme than the nominal split suggests
3. Further delays will only make Bob's position worse
4. We still have 5 rounds left, but it's in both our interests to conclude this soon"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $3800, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $6200, but for them it's actually worth $6200 * 0.4783 = $2965.46 due to 52.17% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I still have 4 rounds left
4. Bob would get less real value ($2965.46) than I would ($3800)
5. Given that I'm being offered less than previous rounds while my negotiating position is getting stronger (due to Bob's increasing inflation penalty), I should reject this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob's money now worth 56.95% less (compounded previous 52.17% plus 10% this round), I'll make an offer that reflects my very strong negotiating position while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Let's analyze the real value of this offer:
- My $8000 is worth full value
- Bob's $2000 is worth $2000 * 0.4305 = $861 due to 56.95% inflation

While this 80-20 split might look severe, I'm making this offer because:
1. Bob's continued rejections have severely weakened their position
2. Even though the nominal amount for Bob is lower, the real value difference from their last offer isn't as dramatic due to inflation
3. We only have 3 rounds left after this
4. If Bob rejects this, their next round's money will be worth even less
5. We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid both getting nothing after round 12"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $3500, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $6500, but for them it's actually worth $6500 * 0.3874 = $2518.10 due to 61.26% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make another offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - Only 2 rounds remain after this
4. Bob would get less real value ($2518.10) than I would ($3500)
5. This offer is worse for me than previous offers, while my negotiating position has only gotten stronger
6. Even though we're getting close to the deadline, I still have enough rounds to make a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only 2 rounds remaining and Bob's money now worth 65.13% less (compounded previous 61.26% plus 10% this round), I need to make a strong but potentially final offer that Bob should seriously consider to avoid getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

Let's analyze this offer:
- My $8500 is worth full value
- Bob's $1500 is worth $1500 * 0.3487 = $523.05 due to 65.13% inflation

While this 85-15 split looks extreme, this is a critical moment because:
1. Only 1 round remains after this
2. If we don't reach agreement in the next round, both get nothing
3. Even this reduced amount for Bob is better than getting nothing
4. Bob's counteroffer in the final round would be worth even less due to additional inflation
5. It's in both our interests to conclude this now rather than risk total failure

I'm making this aggressive offer because the time pressure and inflation have maximized my negotiating leverage, and Bob needs to seriously consider accepting to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this final offer carefully:

1. Bob offers me $3000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $7000, but for them it's actually worth $7000 * 0.3138 = $2196.60 due to 68.62% inflation
3. This is the final round - if I reject, both of us get nothing
4. Getting $3000 is better than getting nothing

While this isn't the best offer I've received during negotiations, and I have maintained a stronger position throughout due to no inflation impact, the alternative to accepting is getting nothing at all. The threat of mutual destruction makes this a forced choice.
