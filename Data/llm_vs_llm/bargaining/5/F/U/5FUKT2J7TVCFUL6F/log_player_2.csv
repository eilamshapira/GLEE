"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
* However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me in the next round
* $4,000 now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
* A guaranteed $4,000 is reasonable rather than risking getting less in future rounds
