"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair. As Bob, I should propose a more balanced split in the next round, considering that while inflation will reduce the value by 5% for me, we still need to reach a reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can conclude the deal before inflation reduces the value further.""}

The 50-50 split is fair and standard in many negotiations. Given that I'm facing 5% inflation per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, but I also can't accept an extremely unfair offer like the previous 90-10 split. A balanced proposal gives us the best chance to reach an agreement quickly."
