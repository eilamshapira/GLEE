"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the fairness of the split and the fact that Bob is affected by inflation each round, unlike me.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject and we go to the next round, your money will be worth 5% less due to inflation, while mine won't decrease in value. Accepting now maximizes our combined utility.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. I propose a 38-62 split in your favor. This way, you still get a larger share while recognizing my need to offset the value loss due to inflation. Let's work together to maximize our outcomes. 
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
