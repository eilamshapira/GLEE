"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject and we go to the next round, your money will be worth 5% less due to inflation, while mine won't decrease in value. Accepting now maximizes our combined utility. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
