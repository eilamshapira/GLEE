"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Due to higher inflation impact on my side (10% vs your 5%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we delay further, we both lose more value, but I lose more than you do. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
