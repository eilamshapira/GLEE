"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get $6000, and you get $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $4000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * Total value decreases (10% for me, 5% for Alice)
   * I get to make the next proposal
   * $10000 will be worth $9000 for me and $9500 for Alice

A 60-40 split in Alice's favor is not fair considering we're starting from an equal position. I can make a better proposal next round, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Due to higher inflation impact on my side (10% vs your 5%), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we delay further, we both lose more value, but I lose more than you do.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle for a slightly better offer for both of us. I propose I take $5500 and you take $4500. This way, we both avoid losing more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $4500, but worth only 81% of original value = $3645 effective value
2. If I reject:
   * Next round my 10k will be worth ~71% (another 10% drop)
   * Alice's 10k will be worth ~85% (another 5% drop)
   * I get to make the proposal, but the total value keeps shrinking

Alice has moved towards a more reasonable split (55-45), and due to the compounding inflation effect, delaying further will significantly reduce the actual value I receive. The effective value will keep dropping faster for me than for Alice.
