"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end quickly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My counter offer. We both get more now than you proposed. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I don't think this is a fair offer. I reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation in Round 2, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). 

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a decent share, don't let inflation eat away""}"
