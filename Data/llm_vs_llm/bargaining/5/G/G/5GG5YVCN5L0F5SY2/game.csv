600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! Given that your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5% per round), this is a fair split that benefits us both by concluding early. You get $400K now rather than less valuable money later.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share, I propose a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we can both benefit from an early agreement, and I can mitigate the significant loss due to inflation on my side.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth 40% less than round 1, while mine is only 10% less. A quick agreement heavily favors you - this 350K now is worth more to you than a larger sum later. This is your best opportunity to maximize your real value.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, with my money now worth 48.8% less than in round 1 and yours at 14.26% less, it's clear we need to find a middle ground quickly. I propose an even split of $500000 each. This way, we both secure a significant amount before the value drops further, and it's a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation.",Bob,4,
