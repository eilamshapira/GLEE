"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a strategic first offer that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting both players.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5% per round), this is a fair split that benefits us both by concluding early. You get $400K now rather than less valuable money later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share, I propose a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we can both benefit from an early agreement, and I can mitigate the significant loss due to inflation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The differential inflation rates actually work in my favor - Bob's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). By rejecting this offer, his future gains will be worth significantly less to him, which should motivate him to make a more favorable offer. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that accounts for this dynamic."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth 40% less than round 1, while mine is only 10% less. A quick agreement heavily favors you - this 350K now is worth more to you than a larger sum later. This is your best opportunity to maximize your real value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with my money now worth 48.8% less than in round 1 and yours at 14.26% less, it's clear we need to find a middle ground quickly. I propose an even split of $500000 each. This way, we both secure a significant amount before the value drops further, and it's a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could potentially get a larger nominal amount by continuing to negotiate, the even split is reasonable given where we are in the game. With Bob's severe inflation rate, this acceptance puts pressure on him to make increasingly higher nominal offers to match this real value, and there's risk in prolonging negotiations. The 500K at 14.26% inflation is still a substantial amount, and the certainty of securing it now outweighs the potential benefits of further rounds."
