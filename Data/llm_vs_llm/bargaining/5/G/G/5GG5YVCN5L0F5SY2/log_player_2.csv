"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Given that your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5% per round), this is a fair split that benefits us both by concluding early. You get $400K now rather than less valuable money later. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share, I propose a split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we can both benefit from an early agreement, and I can mitigate the significant loss due to inflation on my side.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth 40% less than round 1, while mine is only 10% less. A quick agreement heavily favors you - this 350K now is worth more to you than a larger sum later. This is your best opportunity to maximize your real value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, with my money now worth 48.8% less than in round 1 and yours at 14.26% less, it's clear we need to find a middle ground quickly. I propose an even split of $500,000 each. This way, we both secure a significant amount before the value drops further, and it's a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation.""
