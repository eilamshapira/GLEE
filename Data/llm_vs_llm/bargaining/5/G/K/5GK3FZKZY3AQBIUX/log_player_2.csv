"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split closer to the middle to account for the decreasing value. This offer benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think getting slightly more than you is fair. Let's settle on this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking inflation into account, getting $45 now is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round.  It's not ideal, but the value of the money is rapidly decreasing."
