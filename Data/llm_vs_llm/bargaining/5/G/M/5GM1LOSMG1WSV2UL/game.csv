60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 10% depreciation per round, accepting now is better than counter-offering.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but considering the inflation affects me, I think a 50-50 split is more fair. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be strategic. If you reject this, your next offer will be worth even less due to inflation. This 65-35 split is actually better for you than waiting, as future rounds will reduce your money's value by 10% each time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the impact of inflation on me, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, I can compensate for the loss due to inflation, and we can both walk away with a fair share.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, you've already lost over 27% to inflation. If we continue this pattern, you'll lose even more. This 70-30 split gives you $30 now, which is worth more than a larger number later due to your 10% per round inflation. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
