Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but considering the inflation affects me, I think a 50-50 split is more fair. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic. If you reject this, your next offer will be worth even less due to inflation. This 65-35 split is actually better for you than waiting, as future rounds will reduce your money's value by 10% each time.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation on me, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, I can compensate for the loss due to inflation, and we can both walk away with a fair share.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, you've already lost over 27% to inflation. If we continue this pattern, you'll lose even more. This 70-30 split gives you $30 now, which is worth more than a larger number later due to your 10% per round inflation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
