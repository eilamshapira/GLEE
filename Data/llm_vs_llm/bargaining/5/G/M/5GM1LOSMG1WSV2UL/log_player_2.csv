"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 10% depreciation per round, accepting now is better than counter-offering. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I understand Alice's perspective, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement given the inflation affect me. Let's continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but considering the inflation affects me, I think a 50-50 split is more fair. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic. If you reject this, your next offer will be worth even less due to inflation. This 65-35 split is actually better for you than waiting, as future rounds will reduce your money's value by 10% each time. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not equitable given the inflation impact on me. Let's continue negotiating to find a better solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the impact of inflation on me, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, I can compensate for the loss due to inflation, and we can both walk away with a fair share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've already lost over 27% to inflation. If we continue this pattern, you'll lose even more. This 70-30 split gives you $30 now, which is worth more than a larger number later due to your 10% per round inflation. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the impact of inflation, accepting Alice's offer now seems to be the best choice to minimize further losses. Let's conclude the game with this agreement."
