"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair starting point considering the impact of inflation on me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Considering the initial amount is $10,000 and it's now worth 10% less for me, the effective amount for me is $9,000.

To make a fair proposal, I'll aim for a split that reflects the reduced value for me. I propose a 50/50 split of the effective amount for me, which is $9,000, but since the actual amount is $10,000, this translates to me getting $4,500 and Alice getting $5,500. However, to account for the potential difference in inflation effects and to make the proposal more appealing, I'll slightly adjust it in my favor, considering I'm making the offer in this round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle with me getting 5800 and you getting 4200. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, the actual value of $4200 for me is actually less due to the 19% reduction. This means the $4200 is worth approximately $3400 to me (since 19% of $4200 is $798, so $4200 - $798 = $3402).

Given this significant reduction in value for me and comparing it to Alice's offer, I need to weigh the potential benefits of continuing versus accepting this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is worth 19% less for me and considering Alice's previous offers and rejections, I need to make a strategic decision. Since Alice's gain is worth 36% less, she might be more inclined to accept an offer that secures her a larger share of the diminishing value.

However, I must prioritize my own position, considering the inflation effect on me. The effective amount for me, after two rounds of inflation (10% each round), is worth approximately 81% of the original (1 - 0.10 = 0.90, and then 0.90 - 0.10*0.90 = 0.81, or 81% of the original value).

I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the reduced value for both of us but leans towards securing a better deal for myself, given the uncertainty of Alice's inflation rate impact beyond the stated 36% reduction.
