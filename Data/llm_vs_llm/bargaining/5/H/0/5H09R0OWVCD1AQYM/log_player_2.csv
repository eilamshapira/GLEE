"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, it's beneficial for both of us to agree early. This is a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that time costs me more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $450,000, which is 45% of the total
2. If I reject and propose next round, my money will be worth 20% less
3. My $450,000 in next round would effectively be worth $360,000
4. Even if I proposed a better split next round, the 20% inflation would eat into my gains
5. While the split isn't 50-50, it's reasonably close, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation pressure, this is actually a decent offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting now the more prudent choice.
