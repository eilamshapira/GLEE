"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject this offer:
1. I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
2. But the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. The current offer is a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered ""fair""
4. If I reject, my $500,000 would effectively become $475,000 next round

Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation. The current 50-50 split is quite reasonable, and the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive than risking future rounds.
