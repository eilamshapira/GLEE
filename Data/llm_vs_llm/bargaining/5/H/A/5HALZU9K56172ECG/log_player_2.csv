"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a proposal
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * $4000 now is better than $5000 in the next round (after 20% depreciation)

While an even 50-50 split might seem ""fair"", considering the asymmetric inflation rates (20% vs 10%), accepting a 40-60 split in the first round is actually a reasonable deal. If I reject, any future gains would be significantly devalued.
