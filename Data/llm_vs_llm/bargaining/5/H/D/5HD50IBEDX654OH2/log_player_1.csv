Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know time is money—even more for me with that pesky 5% inflation per round. Since if you were to reject and propose in the next round you could claim almost the entire $10000 (and your money might not be discounted at all), I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer. I’m giving you the full pot now to avoid any further devaluation on my side. Let's end this quickly and fairly for you. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
