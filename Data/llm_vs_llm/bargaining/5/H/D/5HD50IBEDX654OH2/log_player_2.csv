Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 0, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know time is money—even more for me with that pesky 5% inflation per round. Since if you were to reject and propose in the next round you could claim almost the entire $10,000 (and your money might not be discounted at all), I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer. I’m giving you the full pot now to avoid any further devaluation on my side. Let's end this quickly and fairly for you.""}"
