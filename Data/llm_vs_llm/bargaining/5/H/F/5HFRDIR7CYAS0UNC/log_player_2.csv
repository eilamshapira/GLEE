"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this easy and split it evenly, 50-50. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $5000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth less than $9500 (10000 * 0.95)
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The 50-50 split is a fair offer, and considering the inflation penalty, trying to negotiate for more could actually result in less value for me. Even if I got a larger share next round, the 5% inflation would eat into those gains.
