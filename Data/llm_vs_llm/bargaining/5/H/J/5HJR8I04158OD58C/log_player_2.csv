"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I take $400,000 while she takes $600,000.

Given that inflation doesn't affect me (0%), but affects Alice by 20% each round, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting earlier offers. If we go to the next round, Alice's share will be worth less to her, while mine retains full value.

By rejecting now, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2 that might be more favorable to me. Alice will be under more pressure to accept since her money is losing value with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now I'll make my counter-offer. Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round for her share, I should propose a division that acknowledges this dynamic while being fair enough that she's likely to accept.

Given that we're now in round 2, if Alice rejects my offer, her potential gains in future rounds will be worth even less to her. I'll offer a more balanced split that still favors me slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a reasonable improvement for me compared to her initial offer, while still giving Alice a substantial amount that's worth more to her now than waiting for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has improved her offer to me from round 1, now offering me $450,000 instead of $400,000.

Let's analyze:
- We're in round 3 now
- Alice's money is worth 36% less to her than in round 1
- My money maintains its full value
- If I reject, I can make another offer in round 4, but Alice's inflation will increase to about 49% (1-(0.8^3))
- Alice is now offering me 45% of the total

Given that Alice is facing significant inflation and has improved her offer, but still proposing a split in her favor, I think I can do better by rejecting this offer and proposing a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 4, Alice's inflation has increased further - her money is worth about 49% less than in round 1 (1-(0.8^3)). If we continue to the next round, it will be worth even less to her.

Since Alice rejected my previous offer of 55/45 split, I'll adjust slightly to make it more appealing while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering $580,000 for myself and $420,000 for Alice. This is a reasonable proposal considering the inflation pressure Alice is facing. If she rejects this, her future gains will be worth significantly less due to the compounding inflation effect, so this should be an attractive option for her to end the negotiation now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering an even 50/50 split of $500,000 each. This is a significant improvement from her previous offers.

Key considerations:
- We're in round 5
- Alice's money is now worth 59.04% less to her than in round 1
- My money maintains full value
- Alice has moved from 60/40 to 55/45 to now 50/50
- If I reject, we move to round 6 where I can make another offer
- With each round, Alice's inflation increases (about 67% by round 6)

Given that Alice has now offered me an equal split despite her severe inflation penalty, and considering we have 7 rounds remaining with increasing pressure on her, this seems like a reasonable offer but I can still potentially do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 6, and Alice's inflation penalty is even higher - her money is now worth about 67% less than in round 1 (1-(0.8^5)). This gives me significant leverage.

Since Alice's last offer was a 50/50 split, and she rejected my previous offer of 58/42, I'll propose a division that's more favorable to me but still reasonable given her increasing inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Alice. Given that we're in round 6 and Alice faces significant inflation on her share, this should be an attractive option for her. The longer we negotiate, the less valuable any amount becomes to her, while my value remains constant. This offer gives her a substantial amount that's worth more to her now than potentially more money in later rounds."
