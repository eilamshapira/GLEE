I propose to take $990,000 and give Bob $10,000. This ensures I get the lion's share while leaving him with a small amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a shame that Bob rejected my generous offer.  But in round two, he's offering me a 50/50 split. I don't know what his inflation situation is, but a half-million dollars is a lot of money, and I can't risk losing more due to inflation.  

Let's accept this offer."
