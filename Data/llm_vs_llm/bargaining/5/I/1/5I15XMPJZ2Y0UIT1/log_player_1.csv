"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less to me, the value of the money decreases with each round.

My available money is $100 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.

So if I receive 50$ in this round, that is worth 50 * 0.9 = 45$ of the original value.

I'll respond with:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, the value of the money is decreasing for me. My money now is worth $100 * (1 - 0.10) * (1 - 0.10) = $81 of original value

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the current value of the money for me. The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 72.9% of its original value.

Therefore, my $45 is worth $45 * 0.729 = $32.805 of the original value.

I'll respond with:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 5. Let's calculate the reduced value of the money. Each round the value is 10% less than before. The current value of my money now is $100 * (1 - 0.10)^4 = $65.61 of the original value.

Here is my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
