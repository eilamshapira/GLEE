"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. While I understand you wanted a larger share, an equal division is the most equitable solution. Please consider that I'm facing 20% inflation each round, so if you reject this fair offer, I'll have to propose an even more imbalanced split in your favor next round due to my declining purchasing power. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
