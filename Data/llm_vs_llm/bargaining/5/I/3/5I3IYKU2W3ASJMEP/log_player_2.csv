"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she keeps $900,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning any amount will be worth less to me.

However, $100,000 is only 10% of the total amount, which seems quite low. Since I get to make the next offer if I reject, and the inflation only affects me (not the total pot), I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation pressure I'm under while still seeking a fairer split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. While I understand you wanted a larger share, an equal division is the most equitable solution. Please consider that I'm facing 20% inflation each round, so if you reject this fair offer, I'll have to propose an even more imbalanced split in your favor next round due to my declining purchasing power.""}"
