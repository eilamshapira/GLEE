"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while she takes $60. If I reject, we move to the next round, but my money will be worth 20% less, while hers only decreases by 5%.

In the next round, I could offer something better for myself, but the total value to me would be at most $80 ($100 Ã— 0.8). So I could potentially get more than $40, but I need to weigh the risk.

Given the steep inflation penalty for me (20% per round) compared to Alice's 5%, delaying too much would hurt me significantly. This first offer of $40 isn't terrible considering our differential inflation rates.
