"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from delaying. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject this offer, I'll have a chance to make my own proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me.

If I reject now and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, even if I ask for 50-50 ($5,000 each), my $5,000 would be worth $4,500 after inflation. That's only $500 more than what I'm being offered now, and Alice might reject my offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

The guaranteed $4,000 now seems better than the uncertain prospect of getting more in future rounds with inflation penalties.
