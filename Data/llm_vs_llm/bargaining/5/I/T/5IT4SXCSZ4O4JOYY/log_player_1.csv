"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us each round. Since I'm going first, I'll try to propose a fair split while also considering the future value loss.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
