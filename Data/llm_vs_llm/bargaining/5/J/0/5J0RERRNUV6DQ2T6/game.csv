6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). If we go to round 2, your $4000 would only be worth $3200 to you, while my share would still be worth $5700. Let's agree now and both walk away with more value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable, given the current value of the money. If we delay further, the value will decrease significantly for both of us. Let's settle on this offer to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we both lose value. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Due to the 20% inflation rate on your side versus my 5%, each round costs you much more than me. This 55-45 split in my favor is economically rational - your $4500 now is worth more to you than $5500 would be after another round of 20% devaluation. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's split the money evenly. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, it's time to settle and walk away with a fair share. Further delays will only reduce our gains.",Bob,4,
