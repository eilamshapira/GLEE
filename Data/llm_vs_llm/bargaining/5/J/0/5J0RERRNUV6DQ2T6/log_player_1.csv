"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). If we go to round 2, your $4000 would only be worth $3200 to you, while my share would still be worth $5700. Let's agree now and both walk away with more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable, given the current value of the money. If we delay further, the value will decrease significantly for both of us. Let's settle on this offer to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we both lose value. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Due to the 20% inflation rate on your side versus my 5%, each round costs you much more than me. This 55-45 split in my favor is economically rational - your $4500 now is worth more to you than $5500 would be after another round of 20% devaluation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the money evenly. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, it's time to settle and walk away with a fair share. Further delays will only reduce our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
