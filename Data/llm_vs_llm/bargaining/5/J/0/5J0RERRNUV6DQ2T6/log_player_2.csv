"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). If we go to round 2, your $4000 would only be worth $3200 to you, while my share would still be worth $5700. Let's agree now and both walk away with more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, I need to act quickly. For Alice, it loses 5% of its value each round.

My offer is a 55-45 split in my favor, considering the decreasing value of money.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable, given the current value of the money. If we delay further, the value will decrease significantly for both of us. Let's settle on this offer to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we both lose value. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Due to the 20% inflation rate on your side versus my 5%, each round costs you much more than me. This 55-45 split in my favor is economically rational - your $4500 now is worth more to you than $5500 would be after another round of 20% devaluation. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I need to make a more competitive offer.

The money I gain is now worth 36% * (1 + 0.2) = 51.6% less than in the first round (20% decrease in round 1 and another 20% decrease in round 2 and 20% of the remaining 64% in round 3, which is roughly 36% total, and then another 20% in this round, for a total of 51.6% decrease, but I will calculate the exact decrease for the next rounds), but for simplicity, I will calculate it as follows:
 Round 1: 10000 
 Round 2: 10000 * 0.8 = 8000 
 Round 3: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400 
 Round 4: 6400 * 0.8 = 5120

For Alice, it's worth 9.75% * (1 + 0.05) = 14.51% less than in the first round (5% decrease in round 1 and another 5% decrease in round 2 and 5% of the remaining 95% in round 3, which is roughly 9.75% total, and then another 5% in this round, for a total of 14.51% decrease, but I will calculate it as follows):
 Round 1: 10000 
 Round 2: 10000 * 0.95 = 9500 
 Round 3: 9500 * 0.95 = 9025 
 Round 4: 9025 * 0.95 = 8573.75

My offer is a 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's split the money evenly. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, it's time to settle and walk away with a fair share. Further delays will only reduce our gains.""}"
