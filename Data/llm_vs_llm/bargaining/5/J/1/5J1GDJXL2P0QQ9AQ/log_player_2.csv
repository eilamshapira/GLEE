"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, am offered $40, and Alice is getting $60. Before considering inflation, this doesn't seem terrible, but I need to account for the reduced value of the money as the rounds go on. If I reject this offer, I will be the proposer next round, but the total value will be less.

Since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet. However, if I reject, the next round *will* have inflation. It's a decent offer, not overly greedy on Alice's part.
