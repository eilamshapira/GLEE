"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6428.57 
# Alice gain: 3571.43 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $6,428.57 (about 64.3%) and keeping $3,571.43 (about 35.7%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me ($9,000 effective value)
   * The money will be worth 20% less to Alice ($8,000 effective value)
   * I get to make the next offer

While this is a decent offer giving me the majority share, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round since:
1. Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%)
2. I'll have the power to make the next offer
3. The current offer, while good, isn't overwhelmingly generous

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
1. The money is now worth 10% less to me ($9,000 effective value)
2. The money is worth 20% less to Alice ($8,000 effective value)
3. Alice will likely reject if I'm too greedy
4. If Alice rejects, we'll lose another 10%/20% in value

I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer than Alice's initial one, but not so aggressive that she's likely to reject:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This gives me 70% of the pot while leaving Alice with a reasonable 30%. Given the faster depreciation of value for Alice, she should be motivated to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation."
