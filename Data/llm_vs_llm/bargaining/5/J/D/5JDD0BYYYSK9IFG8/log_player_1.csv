"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair and strategic first offer considering the 10% inflation penalty I face in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable division for me since I face 10% inflation each round, while you don't. This is actually fair when accounting for that disadvantage. If we delay too long, we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair, and we both get a good amount. We don't want to risk losing more value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to get more than half because I lose 10% value each round while you don't. An even split isn't actually fair given this disadvantage. If we go through all rounds, I'll lose significantly more. This is a reasonable adjustment for the inflation I face.""}"
