"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable division for me since I face 10% inflation each round, while you don't. This is actually fair when accounting for that disadvantage. If we delay too long, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's fair, and we both get a good amount. We don't want to risk losing more value with each round.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to get more than half because I lose 10% value each round while you don't. An even split isn't actually fair given this disadvantage. If we go through all rounds, I'll lose significantly more. This is a reasonable adjustment for the inflation I face. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
