"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This seems fair to both of us, and we can avoid the 10% inflation penalty by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $50, which is an equal split. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the total $100 will be worth only $90 to me in the next round. Even if I were to propose taking all $90 for myself (which Alice would likely reject), I'd still be worse off than accepting $50 now.
