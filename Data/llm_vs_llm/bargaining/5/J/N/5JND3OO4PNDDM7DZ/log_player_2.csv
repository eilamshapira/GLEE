"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's work together and secure this division. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000
- That's only 20% of the total amount
- If I reject, the total amount will be worth 10% less ($900,000), but I can make my own proposal
- I believe I can get a fairer split by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the need for cooperation:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we can both walk away happy.""}"
