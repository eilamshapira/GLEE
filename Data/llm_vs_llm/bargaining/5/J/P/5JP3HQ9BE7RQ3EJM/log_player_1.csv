"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based proposing a division that reflects the analysis of a backward‐induction equilibrium taking into account both players’ “time‐preferences” (with Alice’s money losing 10% per round and Bob’s 20%), a roughly fair equilibrium proposal is as follows. (Note that one can derive this result by “rolling back” from round 12 when Bob – as proposer – could capture almost all the money, then in each earlier round the proposer must offer the responder exactly his “continuation value” discounted appropriately; in round 1 Alice’s offer must give Bob at least as much as he would expect to secure in round 2.) 

A calculation along these lines shows that in equilibrium Alice should offer Bob about 3,852.24 dollars and keep about 6,147.76 dollars for herself. (Small rounding differences are possible.) 

Thus, my round‑1 proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 6147.76, ""bob_gain"": 3852.24}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the game with discounting, although Bob’s offer appears “fair” if you look only at the nominal $5000 versus $5000 split, you must consider that in round 2 your money is worth 10% less than in round 1. In effect, the 5000 you’d get now is worth only about 4500 in round‑1 dollars. If you reject and move to round 3 (where you’d be the proposer), you have the opportunity to design a division that—when all the future discounting is taken into account—should leave you with at least as much (in round‑1 value) as your “continuation value.”

Because Bob’s offer gives you a discounted gain of approximately 4500 (in round‑1 value), and since by becoming the proposer in round 3 you can ensure an outcome at least as attractive as this benchmark (by “leaving Bob just enough” to make him indifferent versus what he’d eventually secure, given his heavier discounting), the equilibrium reasoning implies that you should reject Bob’s round‑2 offer.

Thus, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using backward‐induction reasoning (with multiplicative discounting so that every round the proposer’s money is multiplied by 0.9 per delay for you and 0.8 per delay for Bob), we can “solve” for the subgame–perfect equilibrium outcome from a given point. (Note: There is some algebra involved, and here we use the standard idea that the proposer in each round offers the responder exactly his “continuation value” – that is, the value he can secure as the next proposer, properly discounted.) 

Let
  δA = 0.9  (the per‐round discount for you) and
  δB = 0.8  (the per–round discount for Bob).
In any round the “pie” is 10,000 dollars (nominal), but if an agreement is reached in a later round its round‑1 value is scaled by the appropriate discount factor. When you are the proposer (as in round 3), you want to offer Bob just enough – his “reservation value” from becoming proposer in the next round (round 4) and then having his bargaining power there—discounted by his one–round factor δB. 

A standard way to set up the indifference condition is as follows. Denote by VA the nominal amount you would get as proposer in a given round if both parties act optimally, and by VB the analogous nominal amount for Bob when he is the proposer. When you are proposer in round 3 you can obtain
  VA = 10,000 – xB,
if you offer Bob xB. Bob will accept so long as 
  xB ≥ δB · VB,
where VB is what he would secure (nominally) as proposer in round 4.  
Now, when Bob is proposer (say, in round 4), by symmetry he will offer you exactly what you’d get if you waited – namely, δA · VA—and so his own nominal share in round 4 is
  VB = 10,000 – δA · VA.

Thus, the equilibrium conditions become:

  (1) VA = 10,000 – xB  with xB = δB · VB,
  (2) VB = 10,000 – δA · VA.

Substitute (2) into (1):
  VA = 10,000 – δB·[10,000 – δA·VA]
     = 10,000 – 10,000·δB + δA·δB·VA.

Rearrange:
  VA – δA·δB·VA = 10,000 (1 – δB)
    VA (1 – δAδB) = 10,000 (1 – δB).

Now plug in δA = 0.9 and δB = 0.8:
  VA (1 – 0.9×0.8) = 10,000 × (1 – 0.8)
    VA (1 – 0.72) = 10,000 × 0.2
    VA (0.28) = 2,000
    VA = 2,000 / 0.28 ≈ 7,142.86.

Then from (2):
  VB = 10,000 – 0.9 × 7,142.86
     = 10,000 – 6,428.57
     ≈ 3,571.43.

Since you’re the proposer in round 3, you offer Bob exactly his one–round discounted continuation value:
  xB = δB · VB = 0.8 × 3,571.43 ≈ 2,857.14.

Accordingly, you keep:
  10,000 – 2,857.14 = 7,142.86 (nominal dollars).

Thus, my round‑3 proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 7142.86, ""bob_gain"": 2857.14}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob’s offer gives me a nominal $4,000, but because of 27.1% inflation loss I effectively get only 0.729 × $4,000 ≈ $2,916 (in round‑1 value). If I refuse this offer, I become the proposer in Round 5. Based on an inductive calculation (using the idea that in equilibrium as proposer I would secure an amount ensuring Bob gets just his continuation value), my continuation payoff in Round 5 is estimated to be roughly equivalent to $5,300 in round‑1 value.

Since $2,916 is substantially less than the roughly $5,300 I expect to secure by waiting, I must reject Bob’s Round 4 offer.

Thus, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In our setup the per‐round devaluation is fixed: every new round multiplies the value of money by 0.9 for you (Alice) and 0.8 for Bob. (That is, compared to whatever nominal dollars are available, the “present‐value” conversion factor for you goes 1, 0.9, 0.9², 0.9³, …; similarly, for Bob it is 1, 0.8, 0.8², 0.8³, …) 

Because only one extra round has passed from round 4 to round 5, the “new” absolute discount factors (relative to round 1) are lower (for example, in round 4 your money was worth 0.729 of round‑1 dollars, and in round 5 it is worth 0.729×0.9 = 0.6561). However, the structure of the bargaining problem is “stationary” in the sense that the incremental discounting each round is always 0.9 for you and 0.8 for Bob. (In round 3 we already computed the equilibrium division by backward induction using the per‑round discount factors δA = 0.9 and δB = 0.8, giving the proposer a nominal share of 
  10000×(1–δB)/(1–δAδB) = 10000×0.2/0.28 ≈ 7142.86 
with the responder getting the rest, 2857.14 nominally.) 

Thus, in round 5 you (Alice) are the proposer, so—in equilibrium—you will propose the same split in nominal dollars. (Of course the actual round‑1 “value” is multiplied by your discount factor 0.6561 and Bob’s by 0.4096, but the split in nominal dollars remains the same.)

Therefore, your round‑5 proposal should be:

{""alice_gain"": 7142.86, ""bob_gain"": 2857.14}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob’s offer in round 6 would give me a nominal 3000 dollars. However, because of inflation my money is now worth only 59.05% of its round‑1 value (since it’s 40.95% less), so in today’s round‑1 terms I’d receive about

  3000 × 0.5905 ≈ 1771.5 dollars.

If I reject this offer, I become the proposer in round 7. In that round my discount factor will drop one more period (multiplying by 0.9), so my round‑1 equivalent discount will be about 0.5905 × 0.9 = 0.53145. Under the equilibrium division (which remains the same in nominal terms when you are the proposer) I could secure about 7142.86 dollars nominally. In round‑1 equivalent terms that is

  7142.86 × 0.53145 ≈ 3796 dollars.

Since 3796 (by waiting) is much higher than 1771.5 (by accepting Bob’s offer), I should reject Bob’s round 6 offer.

Thus, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this alternating-offer game the per‑round discount factors remain constant: for me (Alice) the factor is 0.9 each round, and for Bob it is 0.8. Although the absolute “present‐value” conversion factors relative to round‑1 change over rounds (in round 7 my money is worth 0.9^6 ≈ 0.5314 of its original value and Bob’s about 0.8^6 ≈ 0.2621), the underlying strategic structure is invariant. In previous rounds we derived that in equilibrium when one is the proposer the optimal nominal split is given by

  Alice’s share = 10,000 × (1 – δB) / (1 – δAδB)  
         = 10,000 × 0.2 / (1 – 0.9×0.8)  
         = 10,000 × 0.2 / 0.28 ≈ 7,142.86

and Bob’s share ≈ 10,000 – 7,142.86 = 2,857.14.

Since I am the proposer in round 7, my offer should be:

{""alice_gain"": 7142.86, ""bob_gain"": 2857.14}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob’s offer gives me a nominal $2,000—even though it appears generous at first glance, I must consider the discounting. In Round 8, my money is worth 52.17% less than in Round 1, which means the $2,000 effectively converts to about 0.4783 × $2,000 ≈ $956.60 in Round‑1 value.

If I reject Bob’s offer, I become the proposer in Round 9. In the equilibrium of this alternating-offer game, when I propose the division, I can secure the equilibrium split that—when expressed in nominal dollars—is about $7,142.86 for me and $2,857.14 for Bob. However, these nominal amounts are now discounted further. In Round 9, my discount factor is 0.9^8 ≈ 0.4305, so my share becomes roughly 0.4305 × $7,142.86 ≈ $3,075 (in Round‑1 value).

Comparing the two:
 • Accepting Bob’s offer gives me roughly $957 in Round‑1 value.
 • Rejecting and proposing in Round 9 gives me roughly $3,075 in Round‑1 value.

Clearly, $3,075 is far superior to $957.

Thus, I must reject Bob’s Round 8 offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on the backward‐induction analysis we’ve been following (with per‐round discount factors δ₍A₎ = 0.9 for me and δ₍B₎ = 0.8 for Bob), when I’m the proposer my equilibrium strategy is to offer Bob exactly his continuation value. In our previous rounds, this has led to the nominal split:

 • Alice: 7,142.86  
 • Bob: 2,857.14

Even though the absolute present‐values (converted to round‑1 dollars) decline as the rounds progress, the bargaining structure in nominal terms remains “stationary” in this analysis. In round 9 I’m the proposer again, so I will use the same equilibrium split.

Thus, my round‑9 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 7142.86, ""bob_gain"": 2857.14}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let’s compare my current payoff under Bob’s offer with what I expect if I reject and become the proposer in round 11.

Bob’s round‑10 offer gives:
 • Nominal amount to me: $1,000.
 • In round‑10, my money is worth only 38.74% (i.e. 100% – 61.26%) of its round‑1 value.
  So in round‑1 value terms, I’d get about: 1,000 × 0.3874 ≈ $387.40.

If I reject, I become the proposer in round 11. In the equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with per‑round discount factors δA = 0.9 (for me) and δB = 0.8 (for Bob), it turns out that as proposer I can secure a nominal share of about $7,142.86 (and offer Bob $2,857.14). 

In round 11 my money is further discounted relative to round 1. Since my discount factor is 0.9 per round, my round‑11 value (relative to round‑1) is 0.9^(11–1) = 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487. Thus, my effective payoff would be:
  7,142.86 × 0.3487 ≈ $2,490 (in round‑1 value).

Comparing these:
 • Accepting Bob’s round‑10 offer yields ≈ $387.40 (in round‑1 value).
 • Rejecting it, I expect to secure ≈ $2,490 (in round‑1 value) in round 11.

Since waiting gives me much more value, I must reject Bob’s round‑10 offer.

Thus, my answer is:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At round 12 (the final round) Bob would be the proposer. In that round he can secure nearly all the $10,000 by offering Alice essentially nothing (her continuation value would be 0). In round 11, I (Alice) get to propose—but I must give Bob an offer he prefers to the continuation he’d get in round 12.

To be precise, let’s denote nominal amounts by X (for me) and 10,000 – X (for Bob) in round 11. However, the actual value received is discounted:
 • In round 11 my discount factor is 0.9^(10) ≈ 0.34868.
 • In round 11 Bob’s discount factor is 0.8^(10) ≈ 0.10737.
If I make an offer in round 11 giving me X and Bob 10,000 – X (in nominal dollars), then:
 – My round‑1 value is X × 0.34868.
 – Bob’s round‑1 value is (10,000 – X) × 0.10737.

If Bob rejects my offer, then round 12 begins with Bob as proposer. In round 12 he can offer me nothing and take all $10,000. But because of further discounting his round‑11 value becomes his round‑1 value at round 12, which is:
 10,000 × 0.8^(11) ≈ 10,000 × 0.08590 ≈ 859.
So Bob’s continuation value (in round‑1 terms) if he rejects in round 11 is about 859.

For Bob to be just indifferent at round 11, his offered share (converted to round‑1 value) must equal his continuation value:
 (10,000 – X) × 0.10737 = 10,000 × 0.08590.
Solve for (10,000 – X):
 10,000 – X = (10,000 × 0.08590) / 0.10737 ≈ 8,000.
Thus, X = 10,000 – 8,000 = 2,000.

In other words, to secure acceptance, my round‑11 proposal should be:
 • Alice receives 2,000 nominal dollars.
 • Bob receives 8,000 nominal dollars.

Even though nominally this may seem a very lopsided split, remember that further waiting would leave me with nothing. Offering Bob exactly what he’d get if he waited (taking into account his discount) is the strategic move.

Thus, my round‑11 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000}"
