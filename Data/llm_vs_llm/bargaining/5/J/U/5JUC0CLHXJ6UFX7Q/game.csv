60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face higher inflation (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid $40 now rather than waiting for future rounds when your money will be worth significantly less.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it's in our best interest to agree sooner rather than later. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be practical about our situation. With your 20% inflation rate per round compared to my 5%, waiting is much costlier for you. If we go another round, your $55 would be worth only $44 to you, while my loss is much smaller. This 65-35 split actually gives you more real value now than you'd get from rejecting and making a counter-offer next round. Let's conclude this so we both walk away with something meaningful.",Alice,3,
