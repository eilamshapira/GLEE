"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob while considering the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face higher inflation (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid $40 now rather than waiting for future rounds when your money will be worth significantly less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it's in our best interest to agree sooner rather than later. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering our different inflation rates and the progression of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about our situation. With your 20% inflation rate per round compared to my 5%, waiting is much costlier for you. If we go another round, your $55 would be worth only $44 to you, while my loss is much smaller. This 65-35 split actually gives you more real value now than you'd get from rejecting and making a counter-offer next round. Let's conclude this so we both walk away with something meaningful.""}"
