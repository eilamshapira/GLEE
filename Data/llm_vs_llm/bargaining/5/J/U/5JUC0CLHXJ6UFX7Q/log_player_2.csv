"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face higher inflation (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid $40 now rather than waiting for future rounds when your money will be worth significantly less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is now $80 (100 * 0.8). However, for the proposal, I'll still use the original $100 as the base.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it's in our best interest to agree sooner rather than later. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about our situation. With your 20% inflation rate per round compared to my 5%, waiting is much costlier for you. If we go another round, your $55 would be worth only $44 to you, while my loss is much smaller. This 65-35 split actually gives you more real value now than you'd get from rejecting and making a counter-offer next round. Let's conclude this so we both walk away with something meaningful. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
