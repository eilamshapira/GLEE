6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, let's avoid any delays and the risk of inflation by settling now. I propose a split where I receive $6000 and you get $4000. I believe this division is fair given that we both benefit from concluding the deal immediately. I look forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be fair and split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Accepting this offer will ensure we both walk away with a reasonable amount, considering the inflation risk.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of an equal split. However, considering that my share won’t suffer any inflation while yours is discounted by 10% this round, I believe there's an opportunity for a mutually beneficial adjustment if we continue. I look forward to proposing my offer in Round 3!",Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 3 the clock is ticking and further delay continues to cost you due to inflation. Recall that while my share stays constant, your share loses value with each round. In light of this, I’m offering a split where I receive $6500 and you receive $3500. Granted, your $3500 is worth less now, but I believe this deal offers you a better alternative than risking even more devaluation in subsequent rounds. Let’s wrap this up now so we both avoid further losses. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I think we should find a middle ground. I'm offering $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the risks. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to strike a middle ground. However, given that my share maintains its full value while yours continues to depreciate, accepting $4500 now doesn't serve my long‐term interests. I believe that by moving to the next round, I can propose a structure that better reflects the current conditions and secures a superior outcome for me. Let's continue negotiating toward a division that acknowledges these differences.",Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob, as we reach Round 5 the inflation's bite on your share has grown even more severe—your dollars are now worth approximately 35% less than in Round 1. With this in mind, I’m proposing a division that reflects the current state of affairs: I receive $7000 while you obtain $3000. I understand this may seem steep, but given that any delay further diminishes the value of your portion, this offer is, in effective terms, far more favorable than waiting for a subsequent round. I hope you see the wisdom in locking this in now and spare us both further loss.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I see that you are taking advantage of the inflation effect on me. However, I also have to think about my own benefit. I propose I get $6000 and you get $4000. This still gives you a significant amount and allows us to wrap this up before the money loses even more value for me.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, while I appreciate your urgency in trying to close the deal, your current offer gives me only $4000. Since my share isn’t affected by inflation and remains at full value, I believe I can secure a much better outcome in the next round. I must decline your proposal and will be sending my offer in Round 7. Thank you for understanding.",Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter Round 7 the inflation impact on your share deepens further—by now, each dollar you receive is roughly 46-47% less valuable than in Round 1. My share, however, holds its full worth. Given this widening gap, I’m proposing a division where I take $7500 and you get $2500. I realize this might seem lopsided at first glance, but in effective real terms, your portion would be worth far less if we delay any further. Accepting this offer now would be the most rational way to safeguard as much of your value as possible. I hope you see the benefit and agree to conclude our deal here.",Alice,7,
