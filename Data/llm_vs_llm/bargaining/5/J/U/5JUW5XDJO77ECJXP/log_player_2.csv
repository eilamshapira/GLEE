Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 3 the clock is ticking and further delay continues to cost you due to inflation. Recall that while my share stays constant, your share loses value with each round. In light of this, I’m offering a split where I receive $6500 and you receive $3500. Granted, your $3500 is worth less now, but I believe this deal offers you a better alternative than risking even more devaluation in subsequent rounds. Let’s wrap this up now so we both avoid further losses. Looking forward to your acceptance!

# Alice gain: 6500

I'm offering $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the risks. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we reach Round 5 the inflation's bite on your share has grown even more severe—your dollars are now worth approximately 35% less than in Round 1. With this in mind, I’m proposing a division that reflects the current state of affairs: I receive $7000 while you obtain $3000. I understand this may seem steep, but given that any delay further diminishes the value of your portion, this offer is, in effective terms, far more favorable than waiting for a subsequent round. I hope you see the wisdom in locking this in now and spare us both further loss.

# Alice gain: 7000

However, I also have to think about my own benefit. I propose I get $6000 and you get $4000. This still gives you a significant amount and allows us to wrap this up before the money loses even more value for me.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter Round 7 the inflation impact on your share deepens further—by now, each dollar you receive is roughly 46-47% less valuable than in Round 1. My share, however, holds its full worth. Given this widening gap, I’m proposing a division where I take $7500 and you get $2500. I realize this might seem lopsided at first glance, but in effective real terms, your portion would be worth far less if we delay any further. Accepting this offer now would be the most rational way to safeguard as much of your value as possible. I hope you see the benefit and agree to conclude our deal here. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500
