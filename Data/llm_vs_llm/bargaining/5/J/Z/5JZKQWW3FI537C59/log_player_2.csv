"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split this fairly 50/50. This way we both win the same amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by finishing early. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface, giving us each $5,000.

I need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, the money is worth 20% less to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to get more than $6,250 to beat the current $5,000 offer (because $6,250 after 20% inflation equals $5,000).

Given that we have a total of 12 rounds and the inflation penalty compounds, it's risky to reject a reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the 50/50 split is fair and allows us both to avoid inflation losses.
