"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good chunk upfront. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 35% of the total. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. 

Let me think through this carefully. If I reject, I can make a more favorable proposal next round, but I need to account for the 20% depreciation on my end and 10% depreciation on Alice's end. I would need to secure significantly more than $350,000 in the next round to offset this depreciation.

Since the money is worth 20% less to me in the next round, I'd need to get at least $437,500 in the next round to match what I'm being offered now ($350,000 รท 0.8 = $437,500). That would be 43.75% of the total, which might be a difficult negotiation given the asymmetric depreciation rates.
