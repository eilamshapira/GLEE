"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation per round for me and 10% for Alice, waiting could be risky. If I reject:
- Next round my $40 would be worth $32 (20% less)
- Her $60 would be worth $54 (10% less)

While I could try to negotiate for more, the steep inflation rate for me (20%) means I lose more value by waiting. $40 right now is better than potentially getting a bit more but heavily discounted.
