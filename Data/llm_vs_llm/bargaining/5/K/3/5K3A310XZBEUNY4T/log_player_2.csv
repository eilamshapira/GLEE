"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. We both get a good amount, and we can avoid a long negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice's offer gives me $4,500, which is slightly less than half. If I reject and we go to the next round:
1. I get to make a counter-offer
2. But the money will be worth 5% less for me (so $9,500 total value)
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

While $4,500 is less than half, it's still a decent offer. If we keep negotiating, the inflation will reduce the real value of any future deal for me. Also, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer in the next round.
