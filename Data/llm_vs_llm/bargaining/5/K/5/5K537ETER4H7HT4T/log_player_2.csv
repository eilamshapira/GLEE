"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I take $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. If I were to get even a 50-50 split in the next round, that would be $450,000, which is better than the $400,000 I'm being offered now.

Given that I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round and potentially secure a better deal even after accounting for inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm experiencing and provides both of us with a good outcome.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that's favorable to both of us. If we continue to another round, the total value drops for me, and you might end up with less as well depending on your inflation rate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is now offering me $430,000, which is $30,000 more than her initial offer.

Due to inflation in round 3, my money is worth 19% less than in round 1. If I accept the $430,000 now, its effective value to me is $430,000 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $348,300.

If I reject and go to round 4, the inflation will increase further, making the entire pot worth even less to me. Additionally, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better split in the next round.

Since Alice has moved in my direction and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation of value in another round.
