Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's make this a true partnership with an equal split. We both walk away with the same amount, minimizing any worry about inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
