"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I would get $28.57
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. That means in the next round, the $100 pot would effectively be worth $80 to me
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, I need to consider that Alice might reject
5. $28.57 now is better than risking a smaller amount later
