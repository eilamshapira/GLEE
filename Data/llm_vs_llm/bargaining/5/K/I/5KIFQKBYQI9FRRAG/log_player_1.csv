"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to start with, but I need to consider that I'll lose 10% of the value with each passing round if we don't agree now.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest an equal split of the money, which is fair for both of us. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation with each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe an equal division respects both our interests."
