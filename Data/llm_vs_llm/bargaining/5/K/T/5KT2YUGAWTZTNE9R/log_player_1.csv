"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I understand I'm playing as Alice, and I need to consider that:
1. Each round decreases the money's value by 10% for me and 5% for Bob 
2. We have 12 rounds maximum
3. If we don't agree, we both get nothing

Given this, I'll make a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a good portion while keeping a fair share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still very reasonable for Bob. If he rejects, he'll face a 5% depreciation on his next proposal, which means he would need to offer significantly more to achieve the same value for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $480,000 × 0.9 = $432,000 (effective value due to 10% inflation)
   * Bob gets $520,000 × 0.95 = $494,000 (effective value due to 5% inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have further inflation (20% total for me, 10% for Bob)
   * I get to make the next offer
   * But the decreasing value might make it harder to get a better deal

Given that:
* The split is relatively fair (48/52)
* The inflation rates are working against me more than Bob
* We still have many rounds left, but waiting will reduce value for both
* The effective value I'm getting is still substantial

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's reasonably fair and the inflation penalty makes waiting for a better deal potentially costly for me."
