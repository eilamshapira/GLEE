"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $100, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money with each round. It's Round 1, so I should aim for a fair split that Bob is likely to accept to avoid the risk of losing value later.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Explanation: I'm proposing Alice gets $55 and Bob gets $45.  This gives me a slight advantage, but hopefully not so much that Bob rejects it outright. I'm prioritizing securing a deal in Round 1 to avoid the significant loss in value in later rounds."
