"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current value for me (Bob): $45
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * The money will be worth 5% less to Alice
3. This is a fairly balanced offer (45/55 split)
4. The risk of continued negotiation could lead to worse outcomes due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a 50/50 split, the inflation penalty means I might end up with less value in subsequent rounds. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me 45% of the pot.
