"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally for fairness. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. If I reject, the value will decrease by 20% for me but only 5% for Alice in the next round.

If I accept now:
- I get $50
- Alice gets $50

If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less to me, so $80 would only be worth $64 to me. Meanwhile, Alice's discount is only 5%.

Since this is a fair initial offer and rejecting would put me at a disadvantage due to the higher inflation rate for me, I should accept.
