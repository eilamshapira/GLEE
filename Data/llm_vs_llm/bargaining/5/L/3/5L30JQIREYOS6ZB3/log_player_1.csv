"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to divide the $1,000,000, considering that with each passing round, the money loses more value (10% for me, 5% for Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I believe this is a fair first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. The split is reasonable given that Bob has less devaluation pressure than I do, which gives him some advantage in later rounds. I'm offering him a substantial amount that's close to half the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a revised offer, taking into account that each round makes the money less valuable for both of us, but more so for me (10% loss per round for me vs. 5% for Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced than my first proposal, giving Bob a slightly better deal while still ensuring I get a fair share. Since we're now in round 3, and the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to round 1, we both have incentives to reach an agreement soon rather than continuing to negotiate."
