55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $45. This gives you a good starting point, and we avoid losing value to inflation. Let's secure some money now!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to reach a deal quickly. I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45, which is better for you than continuing to the next round where your money loses more value. This is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my previous offer was a reasonable starting point. Now that we are in round 3, and I face a higher devaluation, I'll meet you halfway from my original offer and yours. I offer $52 for me and $48 for you. This is fair, and avoids further losses for both of us.",Alice,3,
