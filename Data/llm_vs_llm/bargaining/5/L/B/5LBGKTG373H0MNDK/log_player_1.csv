Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $45. This gives you a good starting point, and we avoid losing value to inflation. Let's secure some money now!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to reach a deal quickly. I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45, which is better for you than continuing to the next round where your money loses more value. This is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my previous offer was a reasonable starting point. Now that we are in round 3, and I face a higher devaluation, I'll meet you halfway from my original offer and yours. I offer $52 for me and $48 for you. This is fair, and avoids further losses for both of us.""
