"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $45. This gives you a good starting point, and we avoid losing value to inflation. Let's secure some money now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and the inflation rates. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, which means she takes $55.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be reduced by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. This gives me some negotiating leverage since Alice faces higher inflation.

In the next round, the $100 would be worth $95 to me, but only $80 to Alice. This means I could potentially negotiate a better share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to reach a deal quickly. I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45, which is better for you than continuing to the next round where your money loses more value. This is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my previous offer was a reasonable starting point. Now that we are in round 3, and I face a higher devaluation, I'll meet you halfway from my original offer and yours. I offer $52 for me and $48 for you. This is fair, and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $48 out of $100, which is better than her initial offer of $45.

Current situation:
- We're in Round 3
- My inflation penalty is 9.75% (so $48 is worth approximately $43.32 in original value)
- Alice's inflation penalty is 36% (so her $52 is worth approximately $33.28 in original value)

If I reject and we go to Round 4:
- My inflation would increase to about 14.26% (5% more)
- Alice's inflation would increase to about 48.8% (20% more)
- The deal would continue to devalue more significantly for Alice

Alice has moved from $45 to $48 for me, which shows willingness to compromise. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, accepting now gives me a reasonable share while avoiding further devaluation.
