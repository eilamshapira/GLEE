Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for the next rounds where the impact of inflation will be more significant for Alice. She might offer a more reasonable split for us. If the offer is good in the next round, I might accept it, because waiting for later rounds will also affect our gains due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

With this offer, considering the inflation, Alice would still get more money than the offer I rejected, and I would get a larger share as well. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer. If not, we can always reconsider in the next rounds based on the impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer considering the inflation:

* For Bob: 4000 * (1 - 0.2649) = 2939.64
* For Alice: 6000 * (1 - 0.7379) = 1577.46

Although Alice's offer might seem fair at first, considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a much better deal than her. However, if I wait for the next round, Alice's share will be worth even less due to the higher inflation rate for her. Let's reject this offer and make a more reasonable proposal in the next round, considering the impact of inflation for both parties.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, considering the inflation:

* For Bob: 5500 * (1 - 0.2649) = 4044.57
* For Alice: 4500 * (1 - 0.7379) = 1184.59

This offer seems reasonable considering the inflation rates. Let's see if Alice accepts it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer considering the inflation:

* For Bob: 5000 * (1 - 0.3366) = 3316.70
* For Alice: 5000 * (1 - 0.8322) = 833.50

Considering the inflation, I'm getting a much better deal than Alice with this offer. Since we only have a few rounds left and the impact of inflation will be more significant for both parties, it's better to accept this offer and secure my gains.
