"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a more balanced split. I propose 55/45. This is a fair compromise, and we can secure a good amount before inflation impacts us further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
