"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair, appealing offer to Bob that he would likely accept, while still ensuring a good outcome for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. Equal division seems fair and reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is seeking more than an equal share, which suggests he may be accounting for his inflation penalty. Let me make a more strategic offer that acknowledges this factor while still being fair to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split to account for Bob's inflation concern while still ensuring a reasonable outcome for myself."
