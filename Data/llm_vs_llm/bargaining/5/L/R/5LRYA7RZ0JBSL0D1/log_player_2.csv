Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split accounts for the time value of money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try again. This is still a good deal for you, considering how much I lose with each passing round.  Let's not waste any more time. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one, considering the money is now worth less. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the lost value on my end.  Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting desperate here with this inflation! This is my final offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Take it or leave it, and let's both salvage something from this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best move at this point. The money continues to lose value with each passing round, and there's a real risk of ending up with an even worse deal if I continue to reject her offers."
