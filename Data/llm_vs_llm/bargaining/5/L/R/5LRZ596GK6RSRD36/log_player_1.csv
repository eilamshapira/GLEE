"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good portion, but slightly favoring me since I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair offer considering I moved first and I face inflation risk in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I'll get $55, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $49.5 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 20% less
- Given the inflation rates and that we have limited rounds, accepting a reasonable offer early is better
- $49.5 in real value is still a decent amount, and fighting for more might lead to worse outcomes
