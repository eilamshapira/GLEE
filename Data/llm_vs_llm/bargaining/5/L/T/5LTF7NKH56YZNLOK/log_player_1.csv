"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair and generous offer to Bob, taking into account the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $5,500 while giving Bob $4,500, which is a reasonable split considering I face a 10% penalty each round if we don't reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
