"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer does give me a substantial amount ($4500), I should consider whether I can secure a better deal in the next round. However, I need to weigh this against the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, potentially leading to a worse outcome.

Given that there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no cost to me for rejecting and making a counter-offer. I could propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This gives each of us an equal share of the $10,000."
