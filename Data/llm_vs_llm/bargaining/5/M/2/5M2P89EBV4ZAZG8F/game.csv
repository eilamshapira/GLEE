56.0,44.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hurting your share valueâ€”even more as rounds continue. To avoid more erosion of your funds, I propose a near-split: you get $56 (worth about $35.84 at current value) and I get $44. It's very close to the previous offer you made, but if you wait, your effective amount might drop further. Let's end this round now.",Bob,4,
