Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that time works against us (especially for me because of inflation), I propose a split that slightly favors me. Let's settle quickly and avoid further delays where the stakes might change. What do you think?

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is hurting your share valueâ€”even more as rounds continue. To avoid more erosion of your funds, I propose a near-split: you get $56 (worth about $35.84 at current value) and I get $44. It's very close to the previous offer you made, but if you wait, your effective amount might drop further. Let's end this round now. 
# Alice gain: 56 
# Bob gain: 44
