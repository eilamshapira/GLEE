"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair by dividing the $100 equally between us. We both get $50. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. An equal split of $50 each seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, if I reject:
   - Next round my $50 would be worth $47.50
   - Making a more aggressive offer might cause Alice to reject
   - This could lead to a cycle of rejections where we both lose value

Given these factors, accepting a fair 50-50 split in the first round seems like the most rational choice. The inflation penalty makes delaying risky.
