4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your offer. However, considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split. This accounts for the diminishing value of the money over time. This is the best I can do.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your consideration of inflation, but a 55/45 split still seems a bit steep given the circumstances. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, considering the inflation effects on both of us, how about a 48/52 split? This way, we both adjust to the decreasing value but still maintain a sense of fairness.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, the inflation is hitting us both hard. I understand you're aiming for fairness, but my gains have already diminished significantly. I propose 5800 for me and 4200 for you. This is my final offer. Let's not lose more to inflation.",Bob,4,
