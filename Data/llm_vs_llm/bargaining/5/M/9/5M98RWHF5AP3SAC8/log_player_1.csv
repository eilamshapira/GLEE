"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a division that considers both our interests, accounting for the higher inflation penalty I face (20% vs 10%).

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair 60-40 split that gives both of us a substantial amount
2. Since I face higher inflation (20% vs 10%), getting a larger share now is reasonable
3. It leaves Bob with a significant $4,000, which should be appealing enough to accept rather than risk inflation penalties"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $4500, which due to 20% inflation is actually worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
3. While I could counter-offer, Bob's inflation penalty is lower (10%), so they have less pressure to accept quickly
4. We have limited rounds, and prolonging negotiations reduces value for both of us
5. $3600 in real value is still a significant amount, and better than risking further devaluation
