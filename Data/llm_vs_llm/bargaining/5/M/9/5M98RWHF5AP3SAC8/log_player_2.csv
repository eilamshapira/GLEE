"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
The value of the money for Alice after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000

Considering this, my offer for round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
