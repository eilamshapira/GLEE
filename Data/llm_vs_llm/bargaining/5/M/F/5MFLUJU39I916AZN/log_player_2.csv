"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a pretty fair offer from Alice. I would get $520,000 (52%) while she gets $480,000 (48%). 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning my $520,000 would effectively become worth $416,000. Even if I tried to ask for more in the next round, the inflation penalty would likely make me worse off.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and inflation will hurt my position if I delay, I should accept.
