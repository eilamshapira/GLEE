Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, and we can both walk away with significant amounts before inflation reduces our total. Let's end this now with equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
