"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000, suggesting it's a fair ""60-40 split"" in her favor.

While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, I should consider that:
1. This is only the first round
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The 10% inflation penalty means next round we'd be dividing $900,000
4. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer

I believe I can get a more equitable split, so I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.
