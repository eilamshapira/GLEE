4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 20% each round, accepting this offer now maximizes our collective value. If we go another round, the $10000 will only be worth $8000 to you, meaning even a 50/50 split next round would give you less than my current offer. This is a fair deal given our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
