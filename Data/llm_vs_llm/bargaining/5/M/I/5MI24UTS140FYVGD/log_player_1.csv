"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 20% each round, accepting this offer now maximizes our collective value. If we go another round, the $10000 will only be worth $8000 to you, meaning even a 50/50 split next round would give you less than my current offer. This is a fair deal given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
