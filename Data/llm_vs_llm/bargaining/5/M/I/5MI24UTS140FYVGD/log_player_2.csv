"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair offer, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Let's avoid further inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I take $4,000 while she takes $6,000.

I should remember that inflation affects Alice but not me - with each round, the money is worth 20% less to her, while it maintains full value for me. This gives me some negotiating advantage.

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round. Since Alice faces inflation, she'll value the total amount at only 80% in the next round, so I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

Given these considerations, I'll reject her initial offer to pursue a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that leverages my advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 20% each round, accepting this offer now maximizes our collective value. If we go another round, the $10,000 will only be worth $8,000 to you, meaning even a 50/50 split next round would give you less than my current offer. This is a fair deal given our different inflation rates.""}"
