"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, considering that delay will cost me 10% per round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $40.50
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value loss

Given these considerations, I'll accept Bob's offer. Getting $40.50 in effective value now is better than risking further depreciation.
