Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you receive the entire $1000000 right away. Since every extra round slashes my share by 20% while you’re not affected at all, waiting doesn’t improve your position—in fact, by postponing you’d only delay an outcome you're guaranteed as proposer. Please accept this offer and let’s finish quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
