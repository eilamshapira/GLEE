4000.0,6000.0,"Since your money loses 20% value each round, this 4000$ now is worth more than a larger amount later. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Considering my loss, meet in the middle",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"With 44% inflation on your side, this 3000$ now is worth more than 5800$ in future rounds. Time is not on your side, and this is still a substantial amount. Let's conclude this deal now.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"Still willing to compromise, don't push too hard",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Given the 67% inflation on your side, this 2500$ now is worth much more than a larger amount later. Further delays will only reduce your buying power more significantly. This is still a meaningful amount for you, and we should conclude this now before inflation erodes your share further.",Bob,6,

5400.0,4600.0,"Getting desperate, but still want a fair share",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"With almost 79% inflation on your side, this 2000$ now is worth more than your requested 5400$ would be worth next round. You've mentioned desperation, and the math is clear - waiting longer will only hurt you more. This offer gives you real value now rather than rapidly diminishing value later.",Bob,8,
