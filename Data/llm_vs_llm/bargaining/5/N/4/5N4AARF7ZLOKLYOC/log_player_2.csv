"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. This is not an equal split, and given that:
1. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Alice's money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't
3. We have plenty of rounds left

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making my own proposal next round. When Alice's share loses 20% value next round, she might be more inclined to accept a more favorable split for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I should propose a split that accounts for this while still being reasonable enough for her to accept. Her 6000$ from last round would now be worth 4800$ to her, so I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this 4000$ now is worth more than a larger amount later. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering my loss, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me 4200$ (up from her initial 4000$)
2. Her 5800$ is actually worth only 3712$ to her (5800$ * 0.64) due to the 36% inflation on her side
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (44% less than initial)
4. However, I can still get a better deal since I have the advantage of no inflation on my side

Given that:
- I'm not affected by inflation
- There are still 9 rounds left
- Alice's position weakens each round
- The increase from 4000$ to 4200$ is minimal

I believe I can get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, Alice's money has lost 44% of its value, which means she should be more inclined to accept a deal sooner rather than later. I'll propose a split that recognizes this reality while still being acceptable enough for her to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""With 44% inflation on your side, this 3000$ now is worth more than 5800$ in future rounds. Time is not on your side, and this is still a substantial amount. Let's conclude this deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, don't push too hard 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is offering me 4400$ (a small increase from previous offers)
2. Her 5600$ is only worth 2294.4$ to her (5600$ * 0.4096) due to 59.04% inflation
3. She's warning me not to push too hard, but I still have the stronger position
4. We're in round 5 of 12, so there's still time
5. Each round makes her position significantly weaker while not affecting mine

Given that:
- The offer is still not reflecting the severe inflation impact on her side
- I have no inflation pressure
- We still have 7 rounds left
- Her money will be worth about 67% less next round

I believe I should continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth 67% less than the initial value, I need to make an offer that's compelling enough for her to accept while taking advantage of my stronger position. She's shown some flexibility in increasing my share, so I'll propose a split that strongly favors me but still leaves her with a meaningful amount.

{""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Given the 67% inflation on your side, this 2500$ now is worth much more than a larger amount later. Further delays will only reduce your buying power more significantly. This is still a meaningful amount for you, and we should conclude this now before inflation erodes your share further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze the current situation:
1. Alice is offering me 4600$ (only 200$ more than last time)
2. Her 5400$ is only worth 1414.6$ to her (5400$ * 0.2621) due to 73.79% inflation
3. She admits she's ""getting desperate"" which strengthens my position
4. Her money will be worth about 79% less next round
5. I still have no inflation pressure

Even though she's showing signs of desperation, she's not making offers that reflect the severe inflation impact on her side. With her money rapidly losing value and my position remaining strong, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has lost nearly 79% of its value and she's admitted desperation, I'll make an offer that heavily favors me while still leaving her enough to make acceptance a rational choice. Any further delays will drastically reduce her buying power.

{""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""With almost 79% inflation on your side, this 2000$ now is worth more than your requested 5400$ would be worth next round. You've mentioned desperation, and the math is clear - waiting longer will only hurt you more. This offer gives you real value now rather than rapidly diminishing value later.""}"
