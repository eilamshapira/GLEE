"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
2. But the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
3. Alice has no time pressure (0% depreciation)

Current offer value for me: $50
Next round maximum possible value for me: $95 * 0.95 = $90.25

Since I can potentially get more even with the 5% depreciation, and Alice might be willing to accept less than 50% to avoid further rounds, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I should propose an offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept. Given that:

1. The money is worth 5% less to me each round
2. Alice has no depreciation pressure
3. Alice might reject if the offer is too unfair
4. We both get nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is more advantageous than the previous 50-50 offer but not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Let me add a brief explanation to Alice: ""I propose a 60-40 split, which gives both of us a significant portion while acknowledging the time pressure I'm under due to depreciation."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her initial offer from 50 to 53 for me
2. Due to 9.75% depreciation, this $53 is actually worth: $53 * 0.9025 = $47.83 to me
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   * Depreciation will be 14.5%
   * Maximum possible value for me: $100 * 0.855 = $85.50

Alice has made a modest concession, but due to the depreciation, I'm actually getting less real value than in her first offer. However, the depreciation is getting significant, and continuing to reject offers will rapidly decrease the real value I can receive.

Given that Alice seems to be making small incremental concessions and has no depreciation pressure, it's unlikely I'll get a much better deal. The risk of further depreciation outweighs the potential gains from continuing negotiation.
