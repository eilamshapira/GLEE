"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1, in JSON format:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I must decide whether to accept Bob's offer, considering the inflation's impact on my gains.

*   **My gain (nominal):** $4500
*   **Inflation:** 10% reduction in value from Round 1.
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 1:** $1
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 2:** $0.90

To determine if I should accept, let's consider what my $4500 is worth in the context of Round 1:

$4500 * 0.90 = $4050 (equivalent value in Round 1)

In Round 1, I proposed to gain $6000 and now I would gain less than that. This is not ideal. However, I still have 10 rounds to play.
So I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for round 3, keeping in mind the impact of inflation on my gains. My previous offer was rejected, but it's important to remember that the money I receive is worth less now.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer in Round 4.

*   **My nominal gain:** $4200
*   **Inflation:** 27.1% reduction in value from Round 1. (This means my money is worth 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% of its original value.)
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 1:** $1
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 4:** $0.729

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in terms of Round 1:

$4200 * 0.729 = $3061.80

In round 1, I would have earned $6000.
Now I would earn less than half of that. But if I reject the offer, in the next round my share will have even lower value.
So I will reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for round 5. Considering that the money I receive is worth less now due to the continued effect of inflation, I will adjust the offer accordingly.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6.

*   **My nominal gain:** $4000
*   **Inflation:** 40.95% reduction in value from Round 1 (meaning my money is worth 59.05% of its original value)
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 1:** $1
*   **Effective value of $1 in Round 6:** $0.5905

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in terms of Round 1:

$4000 * 0.5905 = $2362

This is a significantly lower return than my initial offer in Round 1.
However, if I reject and the game continues, my potential earnings will become even less valuable. With a limited number of rounds remaining, I'll accept this to secure *something*.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
