"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests while accounting for Bob's 5% per round inflation penalty. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage to me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this, he'll face a 5% devaluation in the next round, which should make this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob offers me $45
- Bob keeps $55 for himself, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $52.25 to him
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but Bob's value will decrease another 5%
- I could try to leverage this in the next round, but there's also a risk of further back-and-forth reducing the total value

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, this offer is reasonably fair and the difference might not be worth the risk of continued negotiation.
