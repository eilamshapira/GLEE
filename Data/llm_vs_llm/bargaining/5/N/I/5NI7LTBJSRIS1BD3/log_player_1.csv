"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split that considers our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a reasonable first offer because:
1. It's close to 50-50, showing good faith
2. Since Bob's inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept early
3. The slight advantage to me compensates for making the first offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Bob is proposing almost the reverse of my initial offer
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $45 is now worth $42.75 (5% less)
   * Bob's $55 is now worth $49.50 (10% less)
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 with even more inflation
4. The total money is still being split reasonably fairly
5. Getting a deal early is better than risking further inflation

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
