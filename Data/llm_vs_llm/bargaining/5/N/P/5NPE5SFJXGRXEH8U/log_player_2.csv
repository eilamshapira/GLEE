"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation rate for both myself and Alice when deciding whether to accept or reject her offer.

Current Round: 1
Alice's Offer: 60/40 split in her favor (Alice: $600,000, Bob: $400,000)

My inflation rate: 5% per round
Alice's inflation rate: 20% per round
Rounds remaining: 12

Let's analyze if accepting now is better than rejecting and making a counter-offer in Round 2.

If I accept now, I get $400,000.

If I reject and propose in Round 2:

*   The total money available will still be $1,000,000 (the game rules don't mention any reduction of the initial amount)
*   The value of money for me will decrease by 5%.

I need to propose a split in round 2 that would give me more than the current value of $400,000, considering the inflation. The value of money for me is 0.95 of what it currently is.

Let's see what value would be better for me. $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000. This is the smallest amount I would accept next round.

Alice will lose 20% of value. If I propose 50/50 next round, that would mean I get $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000. Alice would get $500,000 * 0.80 = $400,000. She is unlikely to agree to this proposal.

Even if I accept 40% next round, I would get $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000. Alice would get $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000. She is unlikely to agree to this.

The current offer gives me $400,000. I'll accept it.
