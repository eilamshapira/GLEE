60.0,40.0,"Let's split it fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. It's a good starting point, considering a deal is better than nothing!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be fairest. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, but remains the same value for you. This equal split benefits both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation by reaching an agreement now.",Bob,2,
