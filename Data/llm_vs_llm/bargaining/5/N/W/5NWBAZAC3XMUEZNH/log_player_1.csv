"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be fairest. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, but remains the same value for you. This equal split benefits both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation by reaching an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
