"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. It's a good starting point, considering a deal is better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's proposal. She's offering me $40 out of the $100, while keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject this offer, I'll proceed to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty that only affects my portion. This means that in the next round, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting $40 now might be better than rejecting and making a counter-proposal where the maximum I could effectively get would be worth less due to the 20% devaluation to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer considering the inflation penalty that affects only my portion.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be fairest. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, but remains the same value for you. This equal split benefits both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation by reaching an agreement now.""}"
