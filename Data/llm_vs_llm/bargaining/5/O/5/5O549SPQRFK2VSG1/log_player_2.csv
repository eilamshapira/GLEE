"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm offering you a good deal, Bob. Take it before inflation eats away at the value! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
* If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% next round when I make an offer
* $400,000 now is better than a higher nominal amount later due to inflation
* While it's not a 50-50 split, it's a substantial amount and protects me from inflation risk

Given the inflation penalty and that this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
