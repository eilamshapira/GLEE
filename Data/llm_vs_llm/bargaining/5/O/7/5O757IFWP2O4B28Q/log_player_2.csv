"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm feeling generous, so I'll take a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 40-60 split in her favor, calling it ""fair"" and ""generous."" While not an even split, I should factor in that if I reject, we move to another round where inflation will reduce the value of my share by 10%.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I'd only be dividing 90% of the original value. Even if I got a better percentage in the next round, the absolute dollar amount might be less than the $40 I'm being offered now.
