"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'll explain my reasoning:

* **Inflation:** While Alice might think she's offering the same amount as before, inflation has hit her harder. Accepting 55 now is worse for her than it was last round.
* **Time Pressure:** As time goes on, the value of the money decreases. While I want a better deal, holding out too long will hurt both of us. 

I'll aim for a slightly better outcome in the next round, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50} 

This offer reflects the increasingly urgent situation created by inflation. While I believe I have a stronger position, a 50/50 split ensures a reasonable outcome for both of us before the money loses significant value."
