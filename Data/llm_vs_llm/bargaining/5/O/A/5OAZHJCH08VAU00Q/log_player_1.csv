"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and we can both walk away with a significant amount. Remember, with each round, the money is worth less for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
