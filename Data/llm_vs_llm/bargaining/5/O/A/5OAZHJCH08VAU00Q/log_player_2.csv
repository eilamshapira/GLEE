"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you 10% of the money. This is a good starting point for us. Let's secure something now! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $1,000 out of $10,000 (10%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
3. However, I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer
4. $1,000 is quite low considering it's an even split negotiation
5. Even with 10% inflation, I can offer a more balanced split next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and we can both walk away with a significant amount. Remember, with each round, the money is worth less for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
