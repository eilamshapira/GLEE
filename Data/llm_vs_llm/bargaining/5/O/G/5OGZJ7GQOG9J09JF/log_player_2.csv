"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally and avoid any reductions for both of us. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the $10,000 pot is effectively worth $9,000 to me) but only 5% less to Alice (making it worth $9,500 to her).

This gives Alice a slight advantage in future negotiations, as she loses less value with each passing round. If I propose in the next round, I'd need to account for this difference in our inflation rates.

Given that we're in the first round with no reduction yet, and a 50-50 split is objectively fair, I'll accept this offer.
