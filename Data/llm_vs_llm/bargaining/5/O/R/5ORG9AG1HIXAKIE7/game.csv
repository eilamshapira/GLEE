618800.0,381200.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 right away – I take $618800 and you get $381200. By accepting now we both avoid the 5% loss per round. It’s a strong, fair offer that meets our rational interests. What do you say?",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get $500000, which is much better than risking further rounds of 5% inflation losses. This is the most equitable solution - there's no reason either of us should get more than the other. Let's agree and both walk away with a substantial sum.",Bob,2,
