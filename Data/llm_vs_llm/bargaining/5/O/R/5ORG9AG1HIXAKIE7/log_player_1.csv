"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 618800, ""bob_gain"": 381200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 right away – I take $618,800 and you get $381,200. By accepting now we both avoid the 5% loss per round. It’s a strong, fair offer that meets our rational interests. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get $500000, which is much better than risking further rounds of 5% inflation losses. This is the most equitable solution - there's no reason either of us should get more than the other. Let's agree and both walk away with a substantial sum. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
