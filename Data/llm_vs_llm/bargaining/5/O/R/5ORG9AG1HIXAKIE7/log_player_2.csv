"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 right away – I take $618800 and you get $381200. By accepting now we both avoid the 5% loss per round. It’s a strong, fair offer that meets our rational interests. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 381200 
# Alice gain: 618800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is correct that we want to avoid the 5% loss per round, but her proposed split of 61.88% for her and 38.12% for me seems quite unfair. There's no clear justification for why she should get such a larger share.

If I reject, the money will be worth 950,000$ next round (5% less), but I'll get to make the proposal. I could offer a more equitable split, and Alice would face similar pressure to avoid further devaluation.

Given that this is round 1 of 12 possible rounds, I have room to negotiate for a fairer deal. The loss from one round of inflation is worth it to establish a more balanced negotiating position.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we're under.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get $500,000, which is much better than risking further rounds of 5% inflation losses. This is the most equitable solution - there's no reason either of us should get more than the other. Let's agree and both walk away with a substantial sum.""}"
