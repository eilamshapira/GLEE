"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us with each passing round. I also need to consider that Bob needs to find the offer acceptable enough to end the game.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Starting Strong:** I'm offering a larger share to myself initially, as I'm making the first offer.
*   **Bob's Incentive:** $4000 is still a significant amount, especially considering the alternative is potentially nothing. The 20% decrease per round for Bob is substantial, so accepting this now is likely more advantageous for him than risking further rounds.
*   **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects this, I will need to offer him more in subsequent rounds due to the inflation effect. This initial offer leaves me some room to negotiate while still securing a good portion for myself."
