"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering:
- For me (Bob): $4,000
- For Alice: $6,000

I need to consider the inflation rates:
- For me (Bob): 20% less per round
- For Alice: 5% less per round

The inflation rate difference means waiting is more costly for me than for Alice. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer, but the total value will be worth less to me in the next round.

This initial offer gives me 40% of the money. While not equal, it's a substantial amount, and delaying would reduce my potential gain due to the higher inflation rate I face.
