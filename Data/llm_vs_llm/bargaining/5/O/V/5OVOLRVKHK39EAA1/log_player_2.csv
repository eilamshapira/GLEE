"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer appears to acknowledge the impact of inflation, it's still skewed in her favor considering the money is losing value for both of us.  I'm aiming to secure a slightly better deal in the next round."
