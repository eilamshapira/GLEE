Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9520, ""alice_gain"": 480, ""message"": ""Alice, each additional round reduces the overall value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in the next round, but due to my future bargaining power and the discount factor you'll end up with almost nothing (roughly equivalent to $500 nominal, or even less in effective terms). To avoid further losses from inflation, I’m offering you $480 now so you secure a bit more than your next-round reservation value. I believe this is the most pragmatic solution for both of us—please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, 58-42 split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, further delay only hurts both of us because of inflation. I'm offering a 42-58 split – exactly as you last proposed in nominal terms – so you get $5800 and I get $4200. Accepting now secures these amounts before they erode any further. I believe this is a fair and practical compromise for us both. What do you say?""}"
