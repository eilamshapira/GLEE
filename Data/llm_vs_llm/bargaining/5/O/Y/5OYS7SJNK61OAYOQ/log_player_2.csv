"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems a bit unfair, especially since I'm taking the risk of a 10% reduction in total value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly more balanced split in my favor, as now we're already dealing with 90% of the original value. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not perfectly even, it's a reasonable compromise and continuing to negotiate would lead to further value loss. With the current 19% inflation, this is actually a fair deal, and it's better than risking more rounds of negotiation."
