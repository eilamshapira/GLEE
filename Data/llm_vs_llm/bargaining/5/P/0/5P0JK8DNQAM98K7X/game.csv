55.0,45.0,Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the $100 so that I get $55 and you get $45. It's a fair distribution considering the game rules. Let me know if you agree or want to make a counteroffer.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation rates. This way, we both get a good share even after the value decreases.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
48.0,52.0,"Hi Bob, let's try 48 for me and 52 for you. This split considers the inflation impacts and gives you a slightly bigger share. I hope this is something we can both agree on.",Alice,3,
