Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the $100 so that I get $55 and you get $45. It's a fair distribution considering the game rules. Let me know if you agree or want to make a counteroffer.

# Alice gain: 55

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's try 48 for me and 52 for you. This split considers the inflation impacts and gives you a slightly bigger share. I hope this is something we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
