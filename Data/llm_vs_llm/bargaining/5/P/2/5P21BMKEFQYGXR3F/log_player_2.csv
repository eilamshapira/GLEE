"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end quickly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the total value will decrease to $800,000 in the next round
4. My potential maximum gain in the next round would be lower due to inflation
5. $400,000 is a substantial amount, though not exactly equal
6. Alice's message suggests a desire for quick resolution

While the split isn't 50-50, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further inflation and potential worse outcomes in subsequent rounds.
