"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I should think about how to divide the money fairly while accounting for the inflation risk. If we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which gives us each $500,000. This is the fairest division and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds where the total value decreases."
