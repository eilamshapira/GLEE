"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering we both lose out with each passing round. Let's work together to get the most out of this.  
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 20% inflation affecting my share, $4500 now is worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and we continue, my next proposal would be subject to 40% inflation
3. The difference between my initial proposal and Bob's counter-offer isn't large enough to risk further devaluation
4. Bob's offer is relatively fair, considering we both need to reach an agreement
5. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky"
