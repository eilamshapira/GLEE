# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a more equitable division where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is much fairer than your initial offer and recognizes that we both need to come to a reasonable agreement before inflation reduces the total value further."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000
