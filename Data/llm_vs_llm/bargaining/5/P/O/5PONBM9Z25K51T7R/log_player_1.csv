"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of the money and the risk of reaching the 12th round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: This offer gives me a slight advantage (60%) while still offering Bob a substantial amount (40%). This aims to make the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept it now, rather than risk further devaluation of the money in later rounds. I believe this balances risk and reward for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze Bob's offer.

*   **My gain:** $450,000, but worth 5% less, so effectively $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500
*   **Bob's gain:** $550,000, but worth 10% less, so effectively $550,000 * 0.90 = $495,000

I need to consider if I can expect a better offer from myself in round 3, taking into account the additional 5% inflation for me.

If I reject and propose in round 3, the total money is still 1,000,000$.

Let's say I could convince Bob to accept an even split in round 3:

*   My gain: 500,000$, but worth 10% less than the first round: so effectively, 500,000 * 0.90 = 450,000$

This is still only a small improvement on Bob's offer, and it relies on Bob accepting an even split.

Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer.
