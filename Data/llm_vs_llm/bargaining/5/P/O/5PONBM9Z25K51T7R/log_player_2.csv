"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base and adjust my share accordingly.
