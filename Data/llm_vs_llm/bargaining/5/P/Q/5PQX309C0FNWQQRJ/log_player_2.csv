"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair and generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant inflation of 20% per round affecting me (Bob), I need to carefully consider if accepting this offer is better than risking future rounds.

Alice is offering me 10% ($100,000), which I would receive immediately if I accept. If I reject and we go to another round, the total money loses 20% of its value for me, making the next round's negotiation over an effective $800,000 from my perspective.

While 10% is a small portion, rejecting would mean I'd need to secure at least $125,000 (or 15.6%) in the next round just to match the current offer's value. The risk seems too high compared to the guaranteed amount.
