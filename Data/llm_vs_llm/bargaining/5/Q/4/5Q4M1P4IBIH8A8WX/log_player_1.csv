"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the 5% inflation penalty I face for each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and allows us to avoid any loss due to inflation."
