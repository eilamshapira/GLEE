"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. A 90-10 split in Alice's favor is too extreme, especially considering I'm affected by 5% inflation per round while she isn't."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is a reasonable and equitable division that gives us both significant value. Since I'm affected by inflation in future rounds and Alice isn't, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. A 50-50 split is a balanced compromise that respects both parties."
