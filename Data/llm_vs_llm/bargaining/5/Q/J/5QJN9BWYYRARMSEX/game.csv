550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial $450000 while I take $550000. This is a fair first offer considering that I face 5% inflation each round, making delays costly for me. If we don't agree now, we both risk losing value through negotiations. Let's settle on this reasonable split and both walk away with significant amounts.",Alice,1,
