"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial $450000 while I take $550000. This is a fair first offer considering that I face 5% inflation each round, making delays costly for me. If we don't agree now, we both risk losing value through negotiations. Let's settle on this reasonable split and both walk away with significant amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth $900,000 to me (if I ask for everything)
   - But $900,000 Ã— 0.9 = $810,000 effective value
   - And Alice would likely reject an unfair offer anyway

3. Alice's offer of $450,000 is:
   - Close to a 50-50 split
   - A substantial amount
   - Available without inflation loss
   - Reasonable given the risk of continued negotiation

4. If negotiations continue:
   - Each round reduces my potential gains by 10%
   - There's no guarantee of getting a better deal
   - Risk of ending up with less due to inflation

Given these factors, $450,000 is a good offer that avoids inflation risk. Making a counter-offer would need to result in significantly more than $450,000 to offset the 10% loss, which is unlikely.
