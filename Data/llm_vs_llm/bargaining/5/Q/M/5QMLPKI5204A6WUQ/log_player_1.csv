"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, keeping in mind the declining value of the money:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, acknowledging the inflation will affect Bob more. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him in the first round."
