"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of the money over time for both myself and Bob. I also need to factor in that I'm going first, so I want to make an offer that's tempting enough for Bob to accept, but still advantageous to me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Alice's Perspective:** Getting $6000 upfront is a good starting point.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** $4000 is a decent amount to receive, and while he might hope for more, the risk of future rounds reducing the value of the money for him (10% per round) might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob offered a 50/50 split. Here's what I need to consider:

*   **Value of Bob's offer for me:** $5000, but it's worth 20% less than in Round 1. So, it's worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 in Round 1 terms.
*   **Potential Gain in Round 3:** If I reject, I'll be making the offer. But the money will be worth 40% less than in Round 1 (another 20% decrease).
*   **Risk:** If we go too many rounds, we both get nothing.

While I would prefer more, a guaranteed $4000 (in Round 1 terms) seems reasonable at this point. It's better than risking getting nothing.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
