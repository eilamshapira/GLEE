"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40 and keeping $60
2. This isn't an equal split, as she's taking more
3. Since it's the first round and I have many rounds left, I can try to negotiate for a better deal
4. The inflation isn't affecting me, so I don't need to rush

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being diplomatic:

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I suggest a perfectly equal split - fair for both of us""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and equal split 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
1. She's offering me $42, slightly better than her first offer of $40
2. I now know she's affected by inflation (36% less value for her)
3. For her, $58 is now only worth about $37.12 in round 1 value
4. She's actually worse off than if she had accepted my 50-50 split
5. Given the inflation is hurting her but not me, I have a stronger negotiating position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that I know inflation is affecting Alice significantly but not me, I'll maintain a firm but fair position:

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""A 50-50 split is still the fairest solution. The longer we wait, the more value is lost to inflation.""
}"
