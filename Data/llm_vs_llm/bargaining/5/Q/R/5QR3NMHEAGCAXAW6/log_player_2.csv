"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
3. The split is perfectly equal, which is fair
4. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation, meaning the total value will be $800,000
5. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total amount to divide would be less

Given these factors, this is actually a very reasonable offer. Getting $500,000 now is better than risking a lower total amount in the next round due to inflation.
