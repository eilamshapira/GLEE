"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'd like to propose a $60/$40 split. I believe it's a fair starting point considering I initiated the proposal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While Alice is offering me $40, we are dividing $100 and there's a reasonable expectation that I could propose a more favorable split in the next round if I reject this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I believe an equal 50/50 split would be the fairest approach since we both have the same decision power in this game. This way we both walk away with the same amount.""}"
