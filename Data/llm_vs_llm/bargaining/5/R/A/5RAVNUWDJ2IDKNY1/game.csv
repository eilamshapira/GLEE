550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, let's cut to the chase: I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. With inflation biting away at the value each round, it's best we agree now so we both secure as much value as possible. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'd prefer a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $500000 which is equitable and reasonable. If inflation is affecting your side, we should reach an agreement quickly, and a fair split seems like the most straightforward solution. Let's finalize this and both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your push for a 50-50 split. Although my share is discounted by inflation in this round, accepting $500000 now (which is worth 90% of its original value) secures $450000 in round-1 value for me. Delaying further would only decrease that value. So, I agree on the fair split. Let's confirm and wrap this up!",Alice,2,accept
