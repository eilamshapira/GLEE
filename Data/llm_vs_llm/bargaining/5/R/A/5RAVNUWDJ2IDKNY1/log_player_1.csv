"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's cut to the chase: I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. With inflation biting away at the value each round, it's best we agree now so we both secure as much value as possible. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'd prefer a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $500000 which is equitable and reasonable. If inflation is affecting your side, we should reach an agreement quickly, and a fair split seems like the most straightforward solution. Let's finalize this and both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your push for a 50-50 split. Although my share is discounted by inflation in this round, accepting $500,000 now (which is worth 90% of its original value) secures $450,000 in round-1 value for me. Delaying further would only decrease that value. So, I agree on the fair split. Let's confirm and wrap this up!""}"
