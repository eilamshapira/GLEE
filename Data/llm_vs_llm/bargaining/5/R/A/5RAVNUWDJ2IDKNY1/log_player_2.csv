"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's cut to the chase: I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. With inflation biting away at the value each round, it's best we agree now so we both secure as much value as possible. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for herself. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's fairly close at 45%-55%. 

Since there's no inflation for me (the prompt states the money is worth 0% less for me each round), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me some negotiating leverage in later rounds.

Given that this is round 1 of potentially 12 rounds, I have plenty of opportunity to negotiate a better split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll craft a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'd prefer a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $500,000 which is equitable and reasonable. If inflation is affecting your side, we should reach an agreement quickly, and a fair split seems like the most straightforward solution. Let's finalize this and both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
