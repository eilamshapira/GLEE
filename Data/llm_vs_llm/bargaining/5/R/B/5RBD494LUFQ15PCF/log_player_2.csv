"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I propose we divide the million dollars by giving me $520K and you $480K. This offer is both fair and efficient—accepting now avoids any potential delays that might reduce our overall value. I look forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we split the money equally, $500K each. This is fair and considers the impact of inflation if we delay further. Let's agree on this and avoid losing value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, notice that with each round your dollars lose another 10% of their value while mine stay full‐value. If you reject this offer, you’ll find yourself in round 4 having to propose—and given that I’m perfectly patient while your share erodes further, you'll end up having to offer me nearly the whole pie in order to get any acceptance from my side. That means your best alternative if you wait is nearly nothing on a discounted basis. To avoid further losses from inflation, I’m giving you $20000 nominally right now (worth $18000 in effective terms), which is better than what you’d realistically secure later. I urge you to accept this immediate, efficient division. 
# Bob gain: 20000 
# Alice gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Alice, given the inflation impact on my share, I need to secure more value now. I offer you $100K and keep $900K. This might seem unfair, but it's a consequence of the game's mechanics and the need to mitigate my losses. Let's settle this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for round 5: I receive $100K and you receive $900K. Remember, in round 5 the nominal dollars you receive are only worth about 65.61% of their face value—about $590490 effectively. If you reject, you'll propose in round 6, but then your money will be discounted even further (roughly 59.049% of nominal), leaving you with nearly the same effective value if you pocket almost the entire million. By accepting now, you secure a guaranteed effective $590490 without further delay or risk. I believe this offer equalizes your return from waiting, making it in your best interest to settle now. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000
