"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to me in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, causing further inflation.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and the inflation penalty, I think I should try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation risk we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting less in the end due to the decreasing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully. Alice has improved her offer slightly from $4,000 to $4,200 for me.

Due to inflation, money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1. If I accept $4,200 now, its effective value to me is approximately $4,200 Ã— 0.81 = $3,402.

If I reject and we move to round 4, inflation will further reduce the value of money for me. Additionally, we only have 12 rounds total, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Alice has shown some willingness to compromise by increasing my share. While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
