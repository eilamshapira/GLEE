"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that gives us both equal value, and I'd like to avoid the 10% inflation penalty that would apply to my share in the next round."
