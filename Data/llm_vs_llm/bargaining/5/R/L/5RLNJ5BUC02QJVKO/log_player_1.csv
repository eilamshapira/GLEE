"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact, it makes sense to adjust the split slightly in my favor. This way, you still get a substantial amount before it devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation impact, I'd rather not let the money devalue further. However, the split seems a bit unfair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is quite reasonable considering inflationâ€™s impact on your share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gain now. While the offer is not ideal, I need to consider the fact that the money will be worth even less to me if I reject it and go to the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
