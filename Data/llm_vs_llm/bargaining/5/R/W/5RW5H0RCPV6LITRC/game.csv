55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. Since money devalues faster for me (20% per round) than for you (5% per round), a slightly higher amount for me helps balance the time value. This way we can both walk away with a good deal without needing to go to additional rounds.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a fair split is essential for a quick agreement. Let's both take an equal share and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I had to reject your 50-50 offer because it doesn't account for our different inflation rates. My money devalues at 20% per round while yours only at 5%. Even with this 58-42 split, I'm effectively getting less value than you due to my higher inflation rate. If we go another round, we'll both lose more value. This split is mathematically fair considering our different circumstances.",Alice,3,
