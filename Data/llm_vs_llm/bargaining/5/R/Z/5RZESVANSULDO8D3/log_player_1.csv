"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair first offer to Bob. I'll propose a slightly higher split for myself since I'm making the first move, but keep it reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split it $55 for me and $45 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial portion, and accepting now means we avoid the 5% inflation penalty."
