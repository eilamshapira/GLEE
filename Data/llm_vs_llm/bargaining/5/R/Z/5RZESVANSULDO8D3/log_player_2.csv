"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer.

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. While not an even split, it's reasonably close. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $95, and I'd make the next offer. 

Let me analyze if waiting is worth it:
- Current offer: I get $45
- If I reject, the pot becomes $95, and even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject
- Further rounds would continue to decrease the total amount

Given that the offer is reasonably fair and the certainty of depreciation, I'll accept.
