8333.33,1666.67,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $8333.33 and you receive $1666.67. This division reflects our differing time valuesâ€”waiting would cost you 20% per round and me only 5%. Accepting now maximizes our outcomes by avoiding further devaluation. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about different depreciation rates, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This proposal gives you 60% ($6000), which is still advantageous for you. If you reject, you'll get 5% less next round ($5700 maximum), and I'll lose 20%. Let's make a fair deal now and both benefit.",Bob,2,
