"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333.33, ""bob_gain"": 1666.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $8333.33 and you receive $1666.67. This division reflects our differing time valuesâ€”waiting would cost you 20% per round and me only 5%. Accepting now maximizes our outcomes by avoiding further devaluation. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about different depreciation rates, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This proposal gives you 60% ($6000), which is still advantageous for you. If you reject, you'll get 5% less next round ($5700 maximum), and I'll lose 20%. Let's make a fair deal now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
