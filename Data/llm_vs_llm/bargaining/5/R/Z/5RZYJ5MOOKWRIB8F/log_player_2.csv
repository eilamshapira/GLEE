"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $8333.33 and you receive $1666.67. This division reflects our differing time valuesâ€”waiting would cost you 20% per round and me only 5%. Accepting now maximizes our outcomes by avoiding further devaluation. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 1666.67 
# Alice gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $1,666.67 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The total value will be worth 20% less to me ($8,000)
   * I could propose a different split, but Alice would also factor in her 5% loss
3. Current offer value: $1,666.67
4. Maximum I could potentially get next round (if Alice accepts): $8,000

While Alice's reasoning about the time value is correct, her proposed split is too extreme. Even with the 20% penalty, I would be better off making a counter-proposal in the next round. I could offer a more balanced split that would still be attractive to Alice given her lower depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging our different depreciation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about different depreciation rates, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This proposal gives you 60% ($6000), which is still advantageous for you. If you reject, you'll get 5% less next round ($5700 maximum), and I'll lose 20%. Let's make a fair deal now and both benefit.""}

My reasoning:
1. This is a more equitable split while still acknowledging Alice's stronger position due to lower depreciation
2. If Alice rejects:
   * Her maximum potential gain next round would be worth 5% less to her
   * My value would decrease by 20%
3. This gives her a strong incentive to accept while ensuring I get a fair share"
