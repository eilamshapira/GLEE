"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally - it's the fairest solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $5,000 for me
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000 total value for next round
   * Even if I ask for more in next round, I'd need to get over $5,556 to beat current $5,000 value
   * Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

A 50-50 split is fair, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting now the better choice.
