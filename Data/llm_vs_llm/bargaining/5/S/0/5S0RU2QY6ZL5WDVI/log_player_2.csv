"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally from the start. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal next round, but my share will be worth 20% less and Alice's share will only depreciate by 5%. This puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

The current offer is a 50-50 split which gives me $500,000. If I wait, even if I manage to negotiate a better percentage split, my share's value will decrease more rapidly than Alice's.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, accepting an equal split in the first round is actually a good deal for me.
