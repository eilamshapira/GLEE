"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty if we go to additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a fair split that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial sum. If Bob rejects this, we'll go to the next round where my potential gains will be worth 5% less, so I believe this is a reasonable starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* Bob's offering me $5000, but due to 5% inflation, it's only worth $4750 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any money I get will be worth another 5% less (so 90.25% of original value)
* Bob isn't affected by inflation, so he has less incentive to settle quickly
* $4750 (real value to me) is less than what I offered in round 1, but not dramatically so

While I could reject and try for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. I'd need to secure significantly more money in the next round to make up for the additional 5% loss.
