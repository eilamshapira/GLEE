"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm thinking strategically about dividing this money. Since we need to reach an agreement, I'll make an offer that's fair but considers inflation's impact on my side.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for myself because I lose 5% value with each round. This is a fair offer that avoids us losing more in future rounds - if we delay, we'll both lose potential value. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away happy!""
