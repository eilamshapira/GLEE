"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since this is Round 1, there's no inflation yet. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40% of the total), which isn't quite equal but is a significant amount.

If I reject, I can make my own offer in Round 2, but the 20% inflation means the total will effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. I need to factor this declining value into my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in Round 2, I need to be mindful that the money is already worth 20% less to me due to inflation, but I don't know how inflation affects Alice. I'll make an offer that's fair but also acknowledges the time pressure we're under.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, and it makes sense to agree quickly before inflation further reduces the value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully. 

In Round 3, there's important new information:
- The money I gain is worth 36% less than in Round 1
- The money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in Round 1
- Alice is offering me $4,500 (45%) and keeping $5,500 (55%)

With 36% inflation for me, if I accept $4,500 now, it's effectively worth $2,880 in Round 1 value ($4,500 Ã— 0.64).

If I reject and we continue to Round 4, inflation will increase further. Also, we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.

Since Alice has improved her offer from Round 1 ($4,000 to $4,500) and we're facing asymmetric inflation that's worse for me than for her, accepting seems reasonable.
