Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering I'm losing value each round, I need a bigger share. This is my final reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob is experiencing significant inflation, making his potential gains less valuable each round. This puts pressure on him to secure a larger share sooner rather than later.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been decreasing (55 to 58). If the trend continues, his next offer might be even less favorable. 
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will offer anything better in future rounds. He might become more desperate and offer even less.

Accepting 42 dollars guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting it risks getting a worse deal later, especially with the uncertainty of Bob's inflation and future offers."
