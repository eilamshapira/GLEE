Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me, considering the inflation.

I don't think this is a fair offer, so I'll reject it.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
