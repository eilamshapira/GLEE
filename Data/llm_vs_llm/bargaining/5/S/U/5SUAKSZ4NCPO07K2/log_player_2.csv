"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $6,000 out of the $10,000, which is 60% of the total. This is a fairly generous first offer.

If I reject, I get to make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 5% less due to inflation. This means the entire $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. Even if I managed to get more in absolute terms, I need to factor in this depreciation.

Since this is a reasonable first offer and inflation will reduce the value of future rounds for me, I'll accept.
