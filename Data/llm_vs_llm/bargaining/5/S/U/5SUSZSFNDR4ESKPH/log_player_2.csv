"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to her.

I think I can get a better deal, and the penalty for one round isn't too severe. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a more balanced offer. Since we're now in round 2, the money is worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. I should take this into account.

I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor to compensate for the higher depreciation rate I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50-50 division
2. The slightly higher amount for me (55%) helps offset my higher depreciation rate
3. It's a reasonable improvement from Alice's initial offer where she wanted 60%

This should be more appealing to Alice than her first offer was to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has improved her offer from 4000$ to 4500$ for me
2. Due to inflation, 4500$ is now worth even less (19% less than round 1)
3. 4500$ in round 3 is actually worth about 3645$ in round 1 value for me
4. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where my money will be worth 27% less than round 1

While I'd like a better deal, the increasing inflation rate is becoming a significant factor. Each round makes any potential future gains worth substantially less, especially for me since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs 5% per round).

I'll accept this offer. The risk of getting less value in future rounds due to inflation outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating further.
