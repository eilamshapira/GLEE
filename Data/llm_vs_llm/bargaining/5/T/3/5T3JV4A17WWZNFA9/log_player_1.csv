"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. Since I face 5% inflation with each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe this even split gives us both a good outcome."
