"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, giving slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance and avoid inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this split: I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. This is a fair and generous first offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, demonstrating my willingness to cooperate. By accepting this offer, we both avoid losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is an unfair split that heavily favors Bob. Even accounting for the 5% inflation, I can make a better offer in the next round. At the current 5% inflation rate, the total value is still $9,500, and a more equitable distribution should be possible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 10% less than the original amount (5% per passed round), so we're effectively dividing $9,000. I'll make a reasonable offer that accounts for this depreciation while still trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 4700, ""bob_gain"": 5300}

I propose this split: I get $4,700 and Bob gets $5,300. This is still a generous offer that gives Bob a larger share, but more balanced than his previous proposal. We should agree soon to avoid further value loss from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, continuing to negotiate would lead to further value loss due to inflation. With the current 14.26% inflation, my $4,200 is worth approximately $3,601 in original value terms. If we continue to the next round, the 5% additional inflation would make any potential gains minimal, and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal. It's better to secure this amount now than risk further depreciation."
