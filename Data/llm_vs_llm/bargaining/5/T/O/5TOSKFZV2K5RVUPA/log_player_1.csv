"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me taking $550,000 and Bob taking $450,000. This is close to an even split, but accounts for the fact that I face higher inflation (10% per round) than Bob does (5% per round), which means delaying agreement is more costly for me than for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I believe we can reach a more equitable split considering the asymmetric inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose a more balanced split with me taking $525,000 and Bob taking $475,000. This is still close to an even split but takes into account that I'm affected by higher inflation (10% per round vs. Bob's 5%), which gives Bob more leverage as rounds progress. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize our mutual losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 437500 
# Bob gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's becoming increasingly less balanced in my favor compared to previous proposals."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 505000, ""bob_gain"": 495000}

I propose a more balanced split with me taking $505,000 and Bob taking $495,000. This is very close to an even 50/50 split while still accounting slightly for the asymmetric inflation rates we face. With each passing round, we're both losing value - me at 10% and Bob at 5% per round. It would be mutually beneficial to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate as we both lose more total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it continues to shift further in Bob's favor without adequate consideration of our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

I propose I receive $490,000 and Bob receives $510,000. This is very close to an even split with a slight advantage to Bob. We're now in round 7, and I've lost over 40% of my potential value while Bob has lost over 22% due to our different inflation rates. It's becoming increasingly urgent to reach an agreement as we're both losing substantial value with each passing round. This offer acknowledges Bob's slight negotiating advantage while still being fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000
