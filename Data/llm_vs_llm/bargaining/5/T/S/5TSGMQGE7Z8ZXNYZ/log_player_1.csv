Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. To move things forward quickly, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise given our alternating offers, and it guarantees us both a solid outcome rather than risking a breakdown in negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is still too favorable to Bob. Let me make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
