444500.0,555500.0,"Alice, delaying the deal means a 20% drop in value. In Round 3 you’d be the proposer over a smaller pie, and our calculations show you’d only get about 355600 in effective dollars. My offer gives you 444500 nominal (about 355600 effective) now—no waiting, no further loss. Let's agree and secure our earnings!",Bob,2,
