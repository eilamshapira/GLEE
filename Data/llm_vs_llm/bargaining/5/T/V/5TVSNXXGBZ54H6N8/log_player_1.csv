Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying the deal means a 20% drop in value. In Round 3 you’d be the proposer over a smaller pie, and our calculations show you’d only get about 355600 in effective dollars. My offer gives you 444500 nominal (about 355600 effective) now—no waiting, no further loss. Let's agree and secure our earnings! 
# Alice gain: 444500 
# Bob gain: 555500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
