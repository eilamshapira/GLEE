In Round 3 you’d be the proposer over a smaller pie, and our calculations show you’d only get about 355,600 in effective dollars. My offer gives you 444,500 nominal (about 355,600 effective) now—no waiting, no further loss. Let's agree and secure our earnings!""}"

# Alice's message: Bob, you made a compelling point about the diminishing value. However, your offer significantly undervalues my position in this negotiation. Let's be fair - this offer ensures we both benefit from a timely agreement. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
