Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 10% depreciation per round and I don't, this 55/45 split is fair and gives you more value than waiting. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
