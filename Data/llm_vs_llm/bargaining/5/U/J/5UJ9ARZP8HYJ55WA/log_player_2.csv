"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alice's generous offer - 60/40 split for a quick and easy agreement! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Alice faces 10% depreciation per round, while I don't face any
4. This means Alice has more pressure to agree quickly
5. Given these factors, I can probably get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer
6. There are still 11 rounds left, giving plenty of room for negotiation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account Alice's time pressure while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since you face 10% depreciation per round and I don't, this 55/45 split is fair and gives you more value than waiting. Let's make a deal now.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a significant improvement for me over Alice's initial offer
2. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it
3. The message reminds Alice of her time pressure
4. It still leaves Alice with a substantial amount
5. It presents the offer as reasonable and mutually beneficial"
