"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round
3. 5% of 4000$ is 200$, so next round the same amount would be worth 3800$ to me
4. I could make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it, leading to further losses

While 4000$ is less than half, it's still a significant amount, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting a reasonable choice. Better to secure a good amount now than risk getting less later.
