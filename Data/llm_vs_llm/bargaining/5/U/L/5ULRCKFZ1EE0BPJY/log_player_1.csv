"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the effect of inflation on my potential earnings in future rounds.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts and we can conclude the deal now without losing value to inflation. If we go to another round, I'll lose 10% of my potential earnings due to inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to secure a bit more for myself. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a good amount, and we can finish the game before inflation affects us too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
