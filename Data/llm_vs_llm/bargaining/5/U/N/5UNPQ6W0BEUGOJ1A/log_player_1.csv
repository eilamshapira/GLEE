Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3

I am trying to offer a more equitable split this time. Bob will likely reject an offer where he receives less than half, and the value of the money is decreasing for me each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, accepting $1 is effectively letting Bob win with almost all of the money. I need to hold out hope for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm lowering my ask slightly.  It's important to recognize that Bob is playing to maximize his gain, and he's likely realized I'm getting hurt more and more by the inflation each round. I need to try and secure a deal, even if it means letting Bob have a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is frustrating, but I have to reject.  Accepting $0 sets a terrible precedent and I'm still hoping Bob might offer something, even a small amount, in the next rounds.  He's clearly trying to pressure me with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 

I'm lowering my offer again, even though it pains me.  It has to be clear to Bob that I'm willing to make a deal, and that getting something is better than getting nothing as the money value for me continues to plummet."
