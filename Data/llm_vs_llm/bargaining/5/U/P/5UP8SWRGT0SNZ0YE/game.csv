55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that we split the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since my share loses 10% of its value each round, agreeing now benefits us both. Let me know if you accept this fair early settlement!",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering there's no time pressure on my side, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still better for you than losing another 10% value in the next round if you reject. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand the logic behind your offer. While it's not exactly what I hoped for originally, the inflation cost on my side makes waiting even less attractive. I accept the 60-40 split in your favor.",Alice,2,accept
