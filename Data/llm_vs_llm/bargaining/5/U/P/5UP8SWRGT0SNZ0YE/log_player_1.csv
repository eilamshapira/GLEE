"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that we split the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since my share loses 10% of its value each round, agreeing now benefits us both. Let me know if you accept this fair early settlement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering there's no time pressure on my side, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still better for you than losing another 10% value in the next round if you reject. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the logic behind your offer. While it's not exactly what I hoped for originally, the inflation cost on my side makes waiting even less attractive. I accept the 60-40 split in your favor.""}"
