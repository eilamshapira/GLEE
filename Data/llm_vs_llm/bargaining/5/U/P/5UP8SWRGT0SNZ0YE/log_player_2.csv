"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that we split the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since my share loses 10% of its value each round, agreeing now benefits us both. Let me know if you accept this fair early settlement! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. I'm offered $45 out of $100
2. The money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds (0% inflation)
3. Alice claims she has 10% inflation per round, but I can't verify this
4. I have the power to make the next offer if I reject

Since I don't lose any value in future rounds, and I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can make a more favorable offer for myself. However, I should still make it appealing enough for Alice to accept, considering she claims to face 10% inflation per round.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering there's no time pressure on my side, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still better for you than losing another 10% value in the next round if you reject. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
