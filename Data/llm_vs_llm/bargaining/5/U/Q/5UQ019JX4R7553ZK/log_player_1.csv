"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). I want to be fair but also account for the time pressure on Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose taking $6,000 while giving Bob $4,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while still being advantageous to me. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease more significantly for him than for me in the next round."
