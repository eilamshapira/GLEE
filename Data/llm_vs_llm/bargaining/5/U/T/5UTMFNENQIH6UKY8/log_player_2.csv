"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total ($4000), keeping 60% ($6000)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But Alice's money will be worth 20% less, and mine 5% less
   * This gives me negotiating leverage since she loses value faster

Given that:
- The offer is somewhat unfair (40/60 split)
- I have significant negotiating power due to the asymmetric inflation rates
- It's early in the game, so I can afford to negotiate
- Alice will be more willing to accept a better offer next round due to her higher inflation rate

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice's money devalues by 20% and mine by 5% after one round:
- For Alice, the money is now worth 80% of original value
- For me, it's worth 95% of original value

I should offer a more balanced split, but one that still favors me slightly since I have the advantage of slower depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair 55/45 split that:
1. Gives Alice a decent portion ($4500)
2. Is better than her initial unfair offer
3. Takes into account our different inflation rates
4. Should be attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current value after inflation:
   * For me: $4300 × (1 - 0.0975) = $3881
   * For Alice: $5700 × (1 - 0.36) = $3648

2. Comparing to previous offers:
   * Round 1: Alice offered me $4000 (rejected)
   * Round 2: I offered myself $5500 (rejected)
   * Now: Alice offers me $4300 (worth $3881 after inflation)

3. Key considerations:
   * The inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us
   * Alice's share is devaluing much faster than mine
   * We still have 9 rounds left, but continuing to reject will reduce value for both
   * Alice has increased her offer to me compared to Round 1

While I might get a better deal in the next round, the risk of further devaluation and potential failure to reach agreement makes this offer more appealing. The effective value difference between our shares is now much smaller due to inflation.
