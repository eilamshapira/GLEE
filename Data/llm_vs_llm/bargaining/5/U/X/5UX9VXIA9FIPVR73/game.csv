650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob! Let's make a fair division considering the inflation effect. I'll take $650000 and you get $350000. This is reasonable since my money loses 10% value each round, and I'd rather we settle quickly so both of us get a good amount.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I propose a more balanced split. I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. This is fair, considering we both face inflation, and leaves us both with a significant amount. Let's not waste any more rounds.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I see your point about a more balanced split. Let's compromise - I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers. Since my inflation rate is higher than yours (10% vs 5%), this adjustment acknowledges that difference while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's settle this now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,3,
