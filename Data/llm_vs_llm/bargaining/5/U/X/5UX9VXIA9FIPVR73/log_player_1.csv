"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's make a fair division considering the inflation effect. I'll take $650,000 and you get $350,000. This is reasonable since my money loses 10% value each round, and I'd rather we settle quickly so both of us get a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I propose a more balanced split. I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. This is fair, considering we both face inflation, and leaves us both with a significant amount. Let's not waste any more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about a more balanced split. Let's compromise - I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers. Since my inflation rate is higher than yours (10% vs 5%), this adjustment acknowledges that difference while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's settle this now and both walk away with good value.""}"
