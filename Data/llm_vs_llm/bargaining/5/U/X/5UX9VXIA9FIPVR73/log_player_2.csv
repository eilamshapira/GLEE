"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make a fair division considering the inflation effect. I'll take $650000 and you get $350000. This is reasonable since my money loses 10% value each round, and I'd rather we settle quickly so both of us get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I propose a more balanced split. I'll take $600,000 and you get $400,000. This is fair, considering we both face inflation, and leaves us both with a significant amount. Let's not waste any more rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about a more balanced split. Let's compromise - I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers. Since my inflation rate is higher than yours (10% vs 5%), this adjustment acknowledges that difference while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's settle this now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
