"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer that considers the inflation effect:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45. I'm offering slightly more for myself knowing that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds for me, but still trying to make an offer that's fair enough that you might accept it right away."
