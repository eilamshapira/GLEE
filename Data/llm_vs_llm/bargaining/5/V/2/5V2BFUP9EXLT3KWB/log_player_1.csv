"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob in this first round, considering the 5% inflation per round that affects my gain.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose this division because it's slightly favorable to me while still being generous to Bob. Since I'm facing 5% inflation with each round, there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives Bob a substantial amount that should be attractive enough to accept rather than moving to another round where the total value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation effects on both sides.

In Bob's offer, I would receive $450,000, which is less than what I proposed in round 1. However, due to inflation, my money is now worth 5% less than in round 1, meaning if I reject and we go to round 3, I'll face additional inflation.

I also now know that Bob faces 20% inflation per round, which is much higher than my 5%. This means Bob has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, I might be able to leverage Bob's higher inflation rate to get a better deal. However, the total pie would be worth less to both of us.

Since Bob's offer gives me a substantial portion (45%) of the money, and considering the risk of further inflation, I'll accept this offer.
