"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me. Since it's the first round, I'll aim for a fair offer that's also slightly in my favor, considering the risk of rejection and the subsequent inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a 60/40 split in his favor. The inflation is affecting me, so the 40 I'd get now is worth 10% less than what I could have gotten in the first round. Let's do some quick calculations:

*   Round 1 potential gain: $55
*   Round 2 inflation: 10%
*   Round 2 value of $1: $0.90
*   Round 2 potential gain from Bob's offer: $40 * $0.90 = $36

Since $36 is significantly less than the $55 I initially proposed (and would have preferred), I will reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is now even more of a factor. The money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1.
I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also gives me enough value to be worthwhile, considering the inflation.

I will try to propose a split closer to 50/50 adjusted for inflation, while acknowledging Bob's previous ask.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```"
