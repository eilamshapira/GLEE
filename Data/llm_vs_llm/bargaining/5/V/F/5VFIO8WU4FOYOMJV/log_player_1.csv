"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the risk of inflation. It's still a fair deal for you, considering the money loses value for you every round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The original amount I would get is $4500, but due to 5% inflation, its value is reduced to $4500 * 0.95 = $4275.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% from Round 1 and 5% from Round 2), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's end this before inflation eats away too much of my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that inflation is affecting your share more. Let's settle this quickly. This offer is still beneficial for you considering the decreasing value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 15% less (5% from Round 1, 5% from Round 2, and 5% from Round 3, but it's actually 5% + 5% * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 = 14.26% less, I will use 14.26% for calculation), its value is reduced to $4000 * 0.8574 = $3429.60, but I will use $4000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4000 * 0.8574 = $3429.60, so $4000 * 0.8574 = $3429.60.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm getting closer to accepting.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.51% less for me now (5% from Round 1, 5% from Round 2, 5% from Round 3, and 5% from Round 4, but it's actually 5% + 5% * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 19.51% less), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 3800, 
""bob_gain"": 6200, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this quickly, I'm losing value every round and I don't want to risk getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation affecting your share more each round, this offer ensures you still get a substantial amount. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less (calculated as 5% + 5% * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 + 5% * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 22.62% less), its value is reduced to $3500 * 0.7738 = $2708.30.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more value. This offer, although not ideal, seems reasonable considering the circumstances.
