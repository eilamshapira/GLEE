"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. We both get $50 each. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, $50 would only be worth $40 to me
4. Even if I could get more in the next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky
5. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty, it's better to accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
