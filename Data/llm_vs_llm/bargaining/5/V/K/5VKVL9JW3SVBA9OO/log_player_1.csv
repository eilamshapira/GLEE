"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to my 10% per round, he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair while accounting for our different positions. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $400,000 at 90% value = $360,000 effective value
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but:
   - Money will be worth 80% of original value for me
   - Money will be worth 60% of original value for Bob
   - This means Bob will be more pressured to accept
3. Since Bob faces steeper inflation, I have more negotiating power in later rounds

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because I believe I can get a better deal, given that Bob faces higher inflation pressure than I do."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3:
- For me, money is worth 80% of original value
- For Bob, money is worth 60% of original value

Bob's position is weakening faster than mine due to higher inflation. I'll maintain a firm position but still offer a fair split considering our circumstances.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering Bob $350,000 which, even at 60% value, is still worth $210,000 to him. If he rejects and we continue, his money will be worth even less next round (down to 40% value), while mine will still be worth 70%. This should make this offer more attractive to him than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   - I get $500,000 at 72.9% value = $364,500 effective value
2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 63.9% for me
   - For Bob, it will be worth only 39% of original value
   - Bob's negotiating position is deteriorating much faster than mine

Since Bob's inflation rate is double mine (20% vs 10%), his position weakens more quickly with each round. The 50-50 split might seem fair, but given our different inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because my stronger position due to lower inflation rate should allow me to negotiate a better split in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point:
- For me, money is worth 63.9% of original value
- For Bob, money is worth only 39% of original value
- Bob's position has significantly weakened

Given these circumstances, I can push for a more favorable split while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

For Bob, $300,000 at 39% value is still worth $117,000. If he rejects, his next round value drops to just 31.2% of original value, making any future negotiations much worse for him. This offer gives him a reasonable amount while reflecting my stronger negotiating position due to lower inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   - I get $550,000 at 59.05% value = $324,775 effective value
2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 53.14% for me
   - For Bob, it will be worth only 26.21% of original value
   - We're halfway through our rounds (6 of 12)

Bob is still offering me less than what I proposed earlier, and his money is now worth only about 1/3 of original value compared to my money being worth about 60%. His negotiating position continues to weaken much faster than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with Bob's severe inflation rate, he should be more willing to accept a deal that favors me more in the next round. The difference between our inflation rates has created an even larger disparity in our negotiating positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this stage:
- My money is worth 53.14% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only 26.21% of original value
- We're now in round 7 of 12, time pressure is increasing
- Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine

Given Bob's severely weakened position (his money has lost nearly 74% of its value), I can push for an even more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

This offer gives Bob $250,000 which at 26.21% value is still worth about $65,525 to him. If he rejects, his value drops to just 20.97% next round, making any future amount worth significantly less. Given that we're past halfway and his severe inflation rate, this offer should be more attractive than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. If I accept now:
   - I get $600,000 at 47.83% value = $286,980 effective value
2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 43.05% for me
   - For Bob, it will be worth only 16.77% of original value
   - We have 4 rounds left

While $600,000 is better than Bob's previous offers, we're at a point where:
- Bob's money is worth only about 21% of original value
- My money is still worth about 48% of original value
- His negotiating position is extremely weak due to the severe devaluation he faces

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because Bob's extremely high inflation rate (his money is worth only about 1/5 of original value) should force him to accept a more favorable split for me in the next round. The risk of rejection is worth taking given the extreme disparity in our positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this critical stage:
- My money is worth 43.05% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only 16.77% of original value
- Only 3 rounds remain after this one
- Bob's money has lost over 83% of its value

Given Bob's severely weakened position and the limited remaining rounds, I'll push for an even more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives Bob $200,000 which at 16.77% value is worth about $33,540 to him. If he rejects:
- His value drops to just 13.42% next round
- We'll have only 2 rounds left
- The risk of getting nothing increases significantly

The threat of getting nothing combined with his severe inflation rate should make this offer more attractive than risking further rounds. Even a larger share later would be worth less to him due to the 20% per round inflation he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze carefully as we're nearing the end:
1. If I accept now:
   - I get $650,000 at 38.74% value = $251,810 effective value
2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 34.87% of original value
   - Bob's money will be worth just 10.74% of original value
   - Only 2 rounds remain
   - Risk of getting nothing is getting serious

Even though I believe I have the stronger position, we're getting dangerously close to the end. If neither of us accepts in the final rounds, we both get nothing. While I could push for more, the risk of mutual failure is becoming significant.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because:
1. The effective value is still reasonable
2. The risk of getting nothing is becoming too high
3. Even though I could push for more, this is a satisfactory outcome given the circumstances and remaining rounds"
