"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, I should aim for a fair split while considering my time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest division, giving us each half a million dollars."
