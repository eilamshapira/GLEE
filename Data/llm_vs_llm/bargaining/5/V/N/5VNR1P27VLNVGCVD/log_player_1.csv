"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor affecting Bob but still appears fair enough that he might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Since you face 10% inflation per round, accepting now gives you more purchasing power than waiting to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
