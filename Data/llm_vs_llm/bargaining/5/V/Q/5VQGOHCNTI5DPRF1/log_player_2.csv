"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering you face 5% inflation per round while I don't. If you reject, your money will be worth less next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * Maximum I could propose for myself would be worth: $10000 * 0.95 = $9500
   * Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me

The 60-40 split is not ideal, but Alice makes a valid point about the inflation pressure I'm under. If we go to multiple rounds, I could end up with less due to the 5% inflation penalty each round.

Given these factors, and the risk of getting an even worse deal in later rounds due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
