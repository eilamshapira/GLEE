"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically about this offer. Alice is proposing I get only 10% of the money ($1000), while she takes 90% ($9000). Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, I should consider making a counter-offer that's more favorable to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be worth 20% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. Even with this reduction, I could propose a much better split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that gives me a better share while still being potentially acceptable to Alice. Since Alice faces no inflation penalty, she has less pressure to accept quickly, but I should still propose something fair enough that she might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money, which is fair to both of us. While Alice might want more, this is a reasonable offer that respects both our interests in the negotiation."
