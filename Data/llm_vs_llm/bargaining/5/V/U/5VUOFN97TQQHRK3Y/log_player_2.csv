"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that I'd still receive a substantial amount ($400,000) and avoiding the guaranteed 20% inflation penalty seems prudent, I'll accept this offer.
