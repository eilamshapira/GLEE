500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob! I propose a perfectly fair 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a significant amount and don't risk losing everything if we run out of rounds. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with this equal division.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but considering the inflation risk I'm taking, I think 60/40 is a more suitable split for me. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's compromise with a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your inflation risk while still being fair to both of us. This is a reasonable middle ground that gives you more than half without going to an extreme split. Let's settle this now before more rounds pass and inflation affects you further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but with inflation already taking a toll, I need a better split to offset the loss. A 65/35 split is more suitable, considering the decreasing value of my share with each passing round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand inflation is affecting you, but we're both losing value as rounds pass. I'm offering you a 42.5/57.5 split, which is very generous considering the risk we both face of getting nothing after 12 rounds. This gives you $575000 - significantly more than me. Let's not risk further rounds where we both might end up with nothing. This is a fair compromise given our situation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but with inflation significantly reducing my share's value, I need a larger portion to make up for the loss. A 70/30 split is the minimum I can accept, considering we're already halfway through the rounds and my share's value will continue to drop.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7 of 12 - we risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon. I'm accepting the 60/40 split you initially proposed, giving you $600000. With inflation at 22.62%, your effective value is still about $464280, which is more than my $400000. This is my final significant compromise. We've both rejected multiple offers already, and continuing this pattern will leave us both with nothing. Let's be reasonable and agree now.",Alice,7,
