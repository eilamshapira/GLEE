Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but considering the inflation risk I'm taking, I think 60/40 is a more suitable split for me. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Let's compromise with a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your inflation risk while still being fair to both of us. This is a reasonable middle ground that gives you more than half without going to an extreme split. Let's settle this now before more rounds pass and inflation affects you further.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but with inflation already taking a toll, I need a better split to offset the loss. A 65/35 split is more suitable, considering the decreasing value of my share with each passing round.

# Bob gain: 650000

I'm offering you a 42.5/57.5 split, which is very generous considering the risk we both face of getting nothing after 12 rounds. This gives you $575,000 - significantly more than me. Let's not risk further rounds where we both might end up with nothing. This is a fair compromise given our situation.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but with inflation significantly reducing my share's value, I need a larger portion to make up for the loss. A 70/30 split is the minimum I can accept, considering we're already halfway through the rounds and my share's value will continue to drop.

# Bob gain: 700000

I'm accepting the 60/40 split you initially proposed, giving you $600,000. With inflation at 22.62%, your effective value is still about $464,280, which is more than my $400,000. This is my final significant compromise. We've both rejected multiple offers already, and continuing this pattern will leave us both with nothing. Let's be reasonable and agree now.""}"
