"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a perfectly fair 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a significant amount and don't risk losing everything if we run out of rounds. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with this equal division. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but considering the inflation risk I'm taking, I think 60/40 is a more suitable split for me. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's compromise with a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your inflation risk while still being fair to both of us. This is a reasonable middle ground that gives you more than half without going to an extreme split. Let's settle this now before more rounds pass and inflation affects you further. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000

""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but with inflation already taking a toll, I need a better split to offset the loss. A 65/35 split is more suitable, considering the decreasing value of my share with each passing round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand inflation is affecting you, but we're both losing value as rounds pass. I'm offering you a 42.5/57.5 split, which is very generous considering the risk we both face of getting nothing after 12 rounds. This gives you $575000 - significantly more than me. Let's not risk further rounds where we both might end up with nothing. This is a fair compromise given our situation. 
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000

""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but with inflation significantly reducing my share's value, I need a larger portion to make up for the loss. A 70/30 split is the minimum I can accept, considering we're already halfway through the rounds and my share's value will continue to drop.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 7 of 12 - we risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon. I'm accepting the 60/40 split you initially proposed, giving you $600000. With inflation at 22.62%, your effective value is still about $464280, which is more than my $400000. This is my final significant compromise. We've both rejected multiple offers already, and continuing this pattern will leave us both with nothing. Let's be reasonable and agree now. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
