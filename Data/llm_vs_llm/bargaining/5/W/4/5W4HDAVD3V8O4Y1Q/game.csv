40.0,60.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $40 for me and $60 for you. Accepting this offer now secures us both a clear outcome, and it helps me avoid the 20% per round inflation hit that would lower my share in later rounds. I believe it's a fair start for us both. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split. Considering I don't know your inflation rate, I'll take a slightly higher share to account for the uncertainty. Let's settle on $55 for me and $45 for you to avoid further potential losses from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-proposal. While I understand your adjustment for uncertainty, the inflation hit means that waiting any further would diminish my share significantly. Accepting your offer now secures me $45 (which is worth 20% less than the first round, but still preferable to risking further losses). So I agree to your proposal.",Alice,2,accept
