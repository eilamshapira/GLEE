"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $40 for me and $60 for you. Accepting this offer now secures us both a clear outcome, and it helps me avoid the 20% per round inflation hit that would lower my share in later rounds. I believe it's a fair start for us both. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split. Considering I don't know your inflation rate, I'll take a slightly higher share to account for the uncertainty. Let's settle on $55 for me and $45 for you to avoid further potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-proposal. While I understand your adjustment for uncertainty, the inflation hit means that waiting any further would diminish my share significantly. Accepting your offer now secures me $45 (which is worth 20% less than the first round, but still preferable to risking further losses). So I agree to your proposal.""}"
