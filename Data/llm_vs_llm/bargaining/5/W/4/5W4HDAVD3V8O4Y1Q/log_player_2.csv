"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $40 for me and $60 for you. Accepting this offer now secures us both a clear outcome, and it helps me avoid the 20% per round inflation hit that would lower my share in later rounds. I believe it's a fair start for us both. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split. Considering I don't know your inflation rate, I'll take a slightly higher share to account for the uncertainty. Let's settle on $55 for me and $45 for you to avoid further potential losses from inflation.""}"
