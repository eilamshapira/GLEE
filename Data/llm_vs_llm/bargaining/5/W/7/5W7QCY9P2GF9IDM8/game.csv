5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we're both participating equally in this negotiation. With the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, accepting a smaller share would significantly reduce my effective gains. This even split respects both our interests.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Okay Bob, considering the inflation, this is my final offer. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're under.",Alice,3,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I've rejected your offer because it was actually lower than your first offer of $4000 to me. Due to inflation, I'm already facing significant reductions in value - now at 36% and increasing each round. This 45-55 split is a compromise that acknowledges both your desire for a larger share and my need to offset the inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree and end this negotiation before inflation further diminishes the value for me.",Bob,4,
