Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we're both participating equally in this negotiation. With the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, accepting a smaller share would significantly reduce my effective gains. This even split respects both our interests.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've rejected your offer because it was actually lower than your first offer of $4000 to me. Due to inflation, I'm already facing significant reductions in value - now at 36% and increasing each round. This 45-55 split is a compromise that acknowledges both your desire for a larger share and my need to offset the inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree and end this negotiation before inflation further diminishes the value for me.

# Bob gain: 4500
