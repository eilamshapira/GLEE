"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be worth less - specifically, 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice. This means the $100 would effectively be worth $90 for me and $95 for Alice in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $50. If I reject, I could potentially get more than $50 in the next round, but the total pie will be worth less to me.

Given that Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine, delaying is more costly for me than for her. This gives her a slight advantage in later rounds.

I think accepting a fair 50-50 split now is reasonable rather than risking a potentially worse outcome after inflation.
