"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair. I'm offering you $45, which is a good deal considering we both lose value over time. Take it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I think 55-45 is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's calculate the impact of inflation.

*   **Alice's Value:** Money is worth 20% less (10% per round * 2 rounds). So, $1 is now worth $0.80.
*   **Bob's Value:** Money is worth 10% less (5% per round * 2 rounds). So, $1 is now worth $0.90.

I need to make an offer that reflects this disparity. I'll offer slightly more than before, hoping he sees the logic.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, inflation is hurting me more. I'm offering you $48. That is more than your last offer to me. It's fair, and we should take it before we both lose more value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed hurting you more, but I've also lost value since the start. Given the current situation, I think 58-42 is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this. I've lost 27.1% of the initial value, and Bob has lost 14.26%. He's offering me $42.

If I reject, my money loses another 10%, and his loses another 5%. It doesn't seem like he will budge. I'm going to accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
