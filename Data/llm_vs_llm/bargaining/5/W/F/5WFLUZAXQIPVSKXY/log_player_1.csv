"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since we both face inflation penalties (yours at 20%, mine at 10%), it's in our mutual interest to agree soon. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor given the inflation asymmetry. This gives you $450000 which is worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation penalties, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round, I'll try to make a more competitive offer.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In Round 2, the money was worth 80% for me and 90% for Bob.
In Round 3, the money is worth 64% for me (80% * 80%) and 81% for Bob (90% * 90%).

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation penalties. This offer gives us both a fair share, given the current value of the money.""}"
