"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The money is worth 10% less to me, so the $1,000,000 becomes worth $900,000 to me
- The money is worth 20% less to Alice, so it becomes worth $800,000 to her

This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round. I could potentially get a better deal than 40%, especially since Alice faces steeper inflation penalties.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since we've moved to round 2, I need to make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates. Alice faces 20% depreciation per round while I face 10%, so I have an advantage in later rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, since we both face inflation penalties (yours at 20%, mine at 10%), it's in our mutual interest to agree soon. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor given the inflation asymmetry. This gives you $450,000 which is worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation penalties. This offer gives us both a fair share, given the current value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is now offering me $480,000 (48%) while keeping $520,000 (52%) for herself.

Due to inflation:
- For me, the $1,000,000 pot is now worth 19% less (worth about $810,000 to me)
- For Alice, it's worth 36% less (worth about $640,000 to her)

Alice has improved her offer from 40% to 48% for me. This reflects our differential inflation rates and is moving in my favor.

If I reject and we move to round 4:
- I'll make the next offer
- My inflation penalty increases to ~27% 
- Alice's penalty increases to ~49%

The offer of $480,000 is reasonable given our current inflation rates, and further delays risk diminishing returns for both of us.
