9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $9999 and you get $1. If you reject and wait until the next round, your share will be 20% less valuable due to inflation, and as the proposer you’d be forced to offer me nearly the entire sum in the following round. In light of that, I believe this offer is the best we can do now. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, since my share is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I propose we split the $10000 evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share considering the current value of money for me. What do you think?",Bob,2,

3333.0,6667.0,"Hi Bob, we’re now in Round 3 and as you know the delay affects your money – at this stage each dollar you receive is worth just 60% of its face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4, but your maximum effective payoff will be close to $10000 × 0.4 = $4000. To be at least as well off by accepting now, your face-value share needs to be at least $4000/0.6 ≈ $6667. Therefore, I propose that you receive $6667 and I get $3333. I believe this is the best rational division given the circumstances. I look forward to your acceptance!",Alice,3,
