"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $9,999 and you get $1. If you reject and wait until the next round, your share will be 20% less valuable due to inflation, and as the proposer you’d be forced to offer me nearly the entire sum in the following round. In light of that, I believe this offer is the best we can do now. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since my share is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I propose we split the $10000 evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share considering the current value of money for me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3333, ""bob_gain"": 6667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we’re now in Round 3 and as you know the delay affects your money – at this stage each dollar you receive is worth just 60% of its face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4, but your maximum effective payoff will be close to $10,000 × 0.4 = $4,000. To be at least as well off by accepting now, your face-value share needs to be at least $4,000/0.6 ≈ $6,667. Therefore, I propose that you receive $6,667 and I get $3,333. I believe this is the best rational division given the circumstances. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
