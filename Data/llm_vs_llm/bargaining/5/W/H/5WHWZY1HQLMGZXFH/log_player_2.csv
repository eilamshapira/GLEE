"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $9999 and you get $1. If you reject and wait until the next round, your share will be 20% less valuable due to inflation, and as the proposer you’d be forced to offer me nearly the entire sum in the following round. In light of that, I believe this offer is the best we can do now. Looking forward to your acceptance!

# Alice gain: 9999

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since my share is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I propose we split the $10,000 evenly at $5,000 each. This way, we both get a fair share considering the current value of money for me. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we’re now in Round 3 and as you know the delay affects your money – at this stage each dollar you receive is worth just 60% of its face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4, but your maximum effective payoff will be close to $10000 × 0.4 = $4000. To be at least as well off by accepting now, your face-value share needs to be at least $4000/0.6 ≈ $6667. Therefore, I propose that you receive $6667 and I get $3333. I believe this is the best rational division given the circumstances. I look forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333
