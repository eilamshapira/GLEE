600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial $400000.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I think a 55-45 split is a fairer reflection of our equal bargaining power.  Let's get this done in round two!,Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I need to ask for more because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. My $700k will actually be worth $560k to me after inflation, while your $300k keeps its full value. This makes it a much more balanced split in real terms.",Alice,3,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. While I understand inflation is affecting you, we need to find a split that's fair for both of us. This 40-60 split still gives you a significant share, and it's a better starting point for a deal than your previous offer.",Bob,4,
