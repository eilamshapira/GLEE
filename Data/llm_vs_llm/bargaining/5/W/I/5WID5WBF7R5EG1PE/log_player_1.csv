"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial $400,000.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a fairer reflection of our equal bargaining power.  Let's get this done in round two! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 20% inflation penalty means I would only effectively get $360,000 (80% of $450,000), while Bob gets $550,000. That's too uneven. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for the inflation effect."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Bob, I need to ask for more because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. My $700k will actually be worth $560k to me after inflation, while your $300k keeps its full value. This makes it a much more balanced split in real terms.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. While I understand inflation is affecting you, we need to find a split that's fair for both of us. This 40-60 split still gives you a significant share, and it's a better starting point for a deal than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With 48.8% inflation, my $600,000 will be worth about $307,200, while Bob gets $400,000. While not ideal, continuing to negotiate would lead to even worse outcomes for me due to increasing inflation. It's better to secure this deal now than risk further devaluation of my share."
