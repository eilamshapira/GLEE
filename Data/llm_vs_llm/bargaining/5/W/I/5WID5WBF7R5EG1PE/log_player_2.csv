"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial $400000.

# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to ask for more because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. My $700k will actually be worth $560k to me after inflation, while your $300k keeps its full value. This makes it a much more balanced split in real terms. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. While I understand inflation is affecting you, we need to find a split that's fair for both of us. This 40-60 split still gives you a significant share, and it's a better starting point for a deal than your previous offer.""}
