"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":9000,""bob_gain"":1000,""message"":""I propose we split the amount with me getting $9000 and you getting $1000. This way, I can ensure a large amount for myself while still giving you something.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. If we keep rejecting offers, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. This balanced approach gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
