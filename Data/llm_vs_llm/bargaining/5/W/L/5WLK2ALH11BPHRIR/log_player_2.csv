"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the amount with me getting $9000 and you getting $1000. This way, I can ensure a large amount for myself while still giving you something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a very uneven split where she gets 90% of the money and I only get 10%. Given that we have 12 rounds and each round brings 10% inflation for me, rejecting might be strategic if I can make a better counter-offer. However, waiting too long would significantly reduce the value of any money I receive.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I suggest an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. If we keep rejecting offers, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. This balanced approach gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
