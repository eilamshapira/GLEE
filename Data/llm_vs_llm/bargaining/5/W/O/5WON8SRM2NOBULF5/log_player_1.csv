"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable but favorable offer for myself, considering potential inflation if negotiations extend.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair starting point that gives me a good portion while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $50 is worth 20% less, so effectively I'd get $40 worth of value
2. If I reject and we continue to next round, any future gains will be worth even less to me (40% less in round 3)
3. Bob's offer is equal split in nominal terms, but because of inflation, it's actually disadvantageous for me
4. However, if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later, and the value will keep decreasing for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal due to inflation affecting my share, continuing the negotiation would likely lead to even worse outcomes for me as the value keeps decreasing."
