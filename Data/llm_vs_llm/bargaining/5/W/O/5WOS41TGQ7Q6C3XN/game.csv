600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. Considering the inflation rate affects me more, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can minimize the impact of inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, since we're both affected by inflation but at different rates, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This is a fair middle ground considering your last offer and the increasing impact of inflation on both of us. Let's end this soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but the inflation rate affects me much more than you. I'm willing to take a higher risk to get a better deal. I propose a 58-42 split in my favor. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable solution before the inflation gets worse.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
530000.0,470000.0,"Hi Bob, given the rapid decrease in the value of money for both of us, I'm adjusting my offer to a 53-47 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my last offer, considering your higher inflation rate. Let's agree soon to avoid further loss.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I know the inflation is getting worse, but I'm still not convinced by your offers. Given the huge difference in inflation rates, I think I deserve a bigger share. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This might be my last attempt at a reasonable deal before I take a more extreme stance.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, with inflation hitting us hard, especially you, I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This is a further compromise from my side, aiming to find a quick resolution before the value drops even more. Let's end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Hi Alice, I know it seems irrational, but given the massive difference in inflation impact, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 62-38 split in my favor. I understand this might not be acceptable to you, but I'm trying to maximize my gain considering the rapidly decreasing value of money for me.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob, we're running out of time and the value of the money is dropping fast for both of us. I'm offering a 51-49 split in my favor now. This is almost an even split, considering the drastic impact of inflation on you. Let's agree on this and end the game before it's too late.",Alice,9,
