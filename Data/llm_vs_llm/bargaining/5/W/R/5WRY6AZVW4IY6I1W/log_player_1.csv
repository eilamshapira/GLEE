"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my 60 dollars from Round 1 are now worth 10% less. I need to make a decision about Bob's offer in Round 2.

If I accept, I get $50 now, which is good. Rejecting means I'll have to make an offer next round, but I will still have to account for inflation.

I will **accept** this offer.

```json

  ""decision"": ""accept""
