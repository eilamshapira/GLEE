Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,""bob_gain"": 50,""message"": ""Let's start with an equal split. Fair for both!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face a 5% inflation rate per round while I don't, waiting costs you more than it costs me. This offer of 40$ for you is actually better than 38$ (which would be 95% of your initial 40$ offer) if we go another round. I think this is fair given our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
