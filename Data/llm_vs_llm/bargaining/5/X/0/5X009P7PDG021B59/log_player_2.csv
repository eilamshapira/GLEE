"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. Fair for both! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer.

An equal split of 50$ for me and 50$ for Alice seems fair at first glance. However, I need to take into account the inflation dynamics in this game.

For me, money doesn't lose value in future rounds (0% inflation rate).
For Alice, money loses 5% value in each round.

If I reject this offer, in the next round I'll make a proposal. Alice would then only get 95% of the value from whatever I offer. This gives me some negotiating advantage.

Since Alice faces inflation while I don't, I could potentially get a better deal in the next round. It would be strategically better for me to make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Since you face a 5% inflation rate per round while I don't, waiting costs you more than it costs me. This offer of 40$ for you is actually better than 38$ (which would be 95% of your initial 40$ offer) if we go another round. I think this is fair given our different positions.""}"
