"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'm playing as Bob.

Let's analyze this offer. I would get $40, and Alice would get $60. Since this is Round 1, the money is worth its full value to both of us. I need to consider the potential loss due to inflation in later rounds if I reject.

If I reject, I get to make a proposal in Round 2, but the total money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice.

For now, I'll reject and see what I can offer in the next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 2. The money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. I need to factor this in. I want to make an offer that's good enough for Alice to accept, but still maximizes my gain.

Let's try offering Alice a bit more than she offered me last time, hoping she'll see it as a good deal considering the inflation.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Round 3. Alice is offering me $45. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **My Inflation:** The money is worth 9.75% less to me. So, $45 is actually worth $45 * (1 - 0.0975) = $40.69 (approximately) in Round 1 dollars.

*   **Alice's Inflation:** The money is worth 19% less to Alice. So, $55 is actually worth $55 * (1 - 0.19) = $44.55 (approximately) in Round 1 dollars.

I need to decide if accepting $40.69 (in Round 1 dollars) is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to more inflation.

I'm going to reject again. It's close, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, Round 4. The inflation is really starting to bite!

*   My inflation is now 14.2625% (1 - (0.95^3))
*   Alice's inflation is now 27.1% (1 - (0.9^3))

I need to make an offer that is very attractive to Alice, given her inflation rate. Let's try offering her a significant portion of the remaining money.
