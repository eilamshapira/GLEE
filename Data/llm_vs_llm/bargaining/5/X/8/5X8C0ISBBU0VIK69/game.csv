613568.0,386432.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now to avoid any loss in value over time. In this offer, I receive $613568 and you receive $386432. Given that waiting means a 10% drop per round for me and 20% for you, your expected future payoff if you delay is roughly equivalent to $386432 today. I believe this is a fair split in our current circumstances—let’s agree and avoid the inflation penalty.",Alice,1,
