"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 613568, ""bob_gain"": 386432, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now to avoid any loss in value over time. In this offer, I receive $613,568 and you receive $386,432. Given that waiting means a 10% drop per round for me and 20% for you, your expected future payoff if you delay is roughly equivalent to $386,432 today. I believe this is a fair split in our current circumstances—let’s agree and avoid the inflation penalty.""}"
