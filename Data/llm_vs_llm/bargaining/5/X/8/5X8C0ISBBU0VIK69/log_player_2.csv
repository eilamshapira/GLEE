"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now to avoid any loss in value over time. In this offer, I receive $613568 and you receive $386432. Given that waiting means a 10% drop per round for me and 20% for you, your expected future payoff if you delay is roughly equivalent to $386432 today. I believe this is a fair split in our current circumstances—let’s agree and avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 386432 
# Alice gain: 613568 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer gives me $386,432
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * $1M × 0.8 = $800K to divide next round

Given that:
- Alice is correct that delaying hurts me more than her (20% vs 10% loss)
- If I reject, any future negotiations start with a smaller pie
- I could try to get more in the next round, but Alice would likely reject knowing she has an advantage in the inflation rates
- Multiple rejections could lead to both of us getting nothing after 12 rounds

While Alice is taking the larger share, her logic about the inflation differential making this fair has merit. The asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage, and prolonging negotiations would likely result in worse outcomes for me.
