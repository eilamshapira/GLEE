"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split. This way, both of us get a fair share and can avoid further rounds and potential inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $50, it would actually be worth $40 to me (50 * 0.8 = 40).

If I reject and make a new offer in the next round, I would face an additional 20% inflation penalty, making any money I receive worth even less. 

Since Bob is offering an equal split and the inflation is already eating into my share, waiting longer will only make things worse for me. It's better to accept now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
