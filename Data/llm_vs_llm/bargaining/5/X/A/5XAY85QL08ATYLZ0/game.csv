450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, since you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you $450000, which is worth more to you now than any amount would be in the next round when your money loses another 20% value. This is a fair split considering our different inflation situations.",Bob,2,
