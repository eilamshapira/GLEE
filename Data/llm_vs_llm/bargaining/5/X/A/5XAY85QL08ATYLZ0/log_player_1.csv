Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you $450000, which is worth more to you now than any amount would be in the next round when your money loses another 20% value. This is a fair split considering our different inflation situations. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
