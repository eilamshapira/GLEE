"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it in a way that gives me a bit more, but still leaves you with a significant sum. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she gets $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice may reject my offer due to her 20% inflation penalty (her money would be worth 20% less next round). This gives me some negotiating leverage.

However, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's always a risk in continuing negotiations that we might end up with a worse outcome if we can't reach agreement.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty and can potentially negotiate for more in the next round, I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty each round, this gives me negotiating leverage. In this round, $1,000,000 is still worth $1,000,000 to me, but for Alice, it's only worth $800,000 of its original value. I should propose a split that acknowledges this reality while still being fair enough that she's likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you $450,000, which is worth more to you now than any amount would be in the next round when your money loses another 20% value. This is a fair split considering our different inflation situations.""}"
