"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I (Alice) get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher (20% per round compared to my 5%), it's in his interest to accept an early offer rather than prolonging the game. This split acknowledges that time pressure while still giving him a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still fair to both of us. Since inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement soon. This 55/45 split gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm less pressured by time. This compromise should help us reach an agreement before inflation significantly devalues our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
