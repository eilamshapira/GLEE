"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now split equally, I should consider the fact that Bob's gain is actually worth 5% less than the original amount.
