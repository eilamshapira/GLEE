"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play this game as Alice and make my initial offer.

Considering the 5% inflation per round for me, I want to propose a fair division that Bob will likely accept to avoid further rounds, which would reduce the value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $5,500 and you receiving $4,500. This is a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial portion, and avoids the inflation penalty I would face if we continue to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the new information about inflation rates, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I receive $5,000, which at 5% inflation is worth $4,750 to me
- Bob receives $5,000, which at 10% inflation is worth $4,500 to him

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- The money will devalue another 5% for me (10% total)
- The money will devalue another 10% for Bob (20% total)

Since Bob's offer is fair (50/50 split) and inflation is affecting Bob more severely than me, accepting this round prevents further value loss for both of us.
