Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I think it's reasonable for me to take a bit more. Let's settle with 550000 for me and 450000 for you.

# Bob gain: 550000
