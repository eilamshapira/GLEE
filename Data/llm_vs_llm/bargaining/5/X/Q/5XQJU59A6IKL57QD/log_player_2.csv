Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I think it's reasonable for me to take a bit more. Let's settle with 550000 for me and 450000 for you.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the inflation rates and the fact that we're losing value with each round, I propose 525000 for me and 475000 for you. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
