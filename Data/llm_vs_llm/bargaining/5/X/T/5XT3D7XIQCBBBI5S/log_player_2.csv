"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth 0.80 * $1,000,000 = $800,000.

Considering this, I'll make a proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
