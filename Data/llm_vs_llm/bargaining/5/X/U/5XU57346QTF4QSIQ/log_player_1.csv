"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a fair and reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll aim for a middle ground that could be appealing to both of us, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 evenly between us, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is 20% less than the face value due to the inflation affecting me. So, the $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 in value to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite low, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for me more significantly than for him. 

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I need to make a strategic decision. By Round 3, the value of the money for me has decreased by 40% from its original value (20% decrease in Round 1 and another 20% in Round 2).

To calculate the offer, I'll consider what I'm willing to accept given the decreased value. If I were to offer myself $450,000, considering the 40% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual value to me would be $450,000 * 0.6 = $270,000.

However, I want to make an offer that is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob, given that his value decrease is less. I'll aim for a split that reflects a bit more generosity towards Bob, hoping he'll accept to end the game sooner rather than later, which would further decrease the value for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, acknowledging the difference in inflation rates and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement before the value decreases further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is 48.8% less than the face value due to the inflation affecting me. So, the $350,000 offered to me is actually worth $350,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $350,000 * 0.512 = $179,200 in value to me.

Considering this significant decrease in value, Bob's offer, while still favoring him, is becoming more relatively attractive simply because the alternative—waiting for another round—would decrease the value even further for me.

Given the substantial decrease in value for me and the fact that Bob's offer, although not ideal, represents a significant portion of the rapidly diminishing value of the total amount, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
