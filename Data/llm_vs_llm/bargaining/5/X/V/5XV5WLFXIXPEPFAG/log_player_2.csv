"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, my initial proposal is to split the amount as $6000 for me and $4000 for you. I think this is a fair start given the inflation effect on me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, looking at how the inflation affects my potential return.

If I reject this round, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% for me. The current offer gives me $4,000, while waiting would mean I'm dividing $9,500 (in my perceived value) in the next round.

This initial offer isn't optimal for me, and I believe I can negotiate a better division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand we both face different constraints, but I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. While I'm affected by 5% inflation per round, this even split gives us both a good outcome without prolonging negotiations. What do you think?""}"
