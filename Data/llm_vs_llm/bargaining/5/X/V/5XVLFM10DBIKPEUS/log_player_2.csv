"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's only fair, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give each of us $5,000. This is a perfectly fair and reasonable offer that follows the principle of equality. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's a risk that any subsequent negotiations could lead to a worse outcome. A fair split right from the start shows good faith and eliminates any potential conflict.
