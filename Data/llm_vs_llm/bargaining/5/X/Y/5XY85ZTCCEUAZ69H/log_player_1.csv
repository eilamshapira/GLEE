Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every delay costs us both extra losses. Accepting this division now guarantees you $200K in today’s value, whereas further rounds will shrink our total pot by 20% each time. Let’s not lose more—this is a fair offer given the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 800000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay further shrinks our total pot. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but by then the money is worth only 40.96% of our original value, and in equilibrium you’d secure about 5/9 of that—roughly $227556 in present value. My offer here gives you $444444 nominally (which is worth about $227556 at today’s value), exactly matching your best alternative if you wait. Let’s agree now before we lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 444444 
# Bob gain: 555556

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both feeling the burn from inflation—what we agree on now is worth more than further delays. In round 6 the entire 1000000 is only worth about 32.77% of its original value, while waiting until round 7 will drop it further to about 26.21%. In equilibrium, if you wait to propose in round 7 you’d secure roughly 55.56% of that diminished pie, which in today’s terms is equivalent to about $145635. To guarantee you don’t lose further value, I'm offering you $444444 (nominal) immediately—exactly the amount you'd expect by waiting. Let’s settle now and minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 444444

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, at this stage further delay only destroys more of our pie. My offer gives you 444444 dollars, which in today's value exactly matches what you'd be able to secure by waiting until round 9. This is the fair, equilibrium split (5/9 for me and 4/9 for you) when I propose, so please accept now rather than lose even more value.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
