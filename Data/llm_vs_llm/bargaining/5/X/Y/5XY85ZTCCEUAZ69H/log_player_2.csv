Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, every delay costs us both extra losses.

If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but by then the money is worth only 40.96% of our original value, and in equilibrium you’d secure about 5/9 of that—roughly $227,556 in present value. My offer here gives you $444,444 nominally (which is worth about $227,556 at today’s value), exactly matching your best alternative if you wait. Let’s agree now before we lose even more value.""}"

Round 6

In round 6 the entire 1,000,000 is only worth about 32.77% of its original value, while waiting until round 7 will drop it further to about 26.21%. In equilibrium, if you wait to propose in round 7 you’d secure roughly 55.56% of that diminished pie, which in today’s terms is equivalent to about $145,635. To guarantee you don’t lose further value, I'm offering you $444,444 (nominal) immediately—exactly the amount you'd expect by waiting. Let’s settle now and minimize our losses.""}"
