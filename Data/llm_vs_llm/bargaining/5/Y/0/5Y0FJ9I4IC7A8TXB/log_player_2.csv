"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, my next offer will be affected by 20% inflation
3. She's taking a larger share (60%) for herself
4. However, waiting means risking further value loss and potential complete loss if we reach round 12

While 40% isn't an equal split, getting $400,000 now is better than risking inflation losses. If I reject and the negotiation continues, my purchasing power will decrease by 20% each round, making future gains less valuable.
