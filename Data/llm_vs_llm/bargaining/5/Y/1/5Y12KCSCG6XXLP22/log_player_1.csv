"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the $5,500 I'd receive is now worth only $5,500 * 0.90 = $4,950 in terms of its real value to me.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account the further inflation (now 20% total):

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. The initial value of the money was $10,000. With 27.1% inflation, the real value of the $6,000 offered to me is:

$6,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $6,000 * 0.729 = $4,374

Since this offer effectively gives me $4,374 in real value and the previous offers I made were lower, I will **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 5. The total inflation is now much higher, so I need to adjust my offer significantly.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
