While not great, it's still better to hold out for a better offer.  Alice is getting hit much harder by inflation, which works in my favor."

This is barely better than her last offer, and still significantly worse for me.  The pressure from inflation is on her much more than me."

I'm increasing my ask slightly. It's a gamble, but given the inflation rates, Alice might be getting desperate enough to accept."

It's not ideal, but with the inflation rates, this is likely the best I'll be able to get. It's better to take a guaranteed win now than risk getting even less later."
