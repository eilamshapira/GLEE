"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that gives both Bob and I a fair share, considering the potential impact of inflation if we need multiple rounds to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I take $550,000 and Bob takes $450,000. I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself knowing that inflation will reduce the value of any future agreement for me, but I'm still giving Bob a substantial portion to encourage acceptance in this first round."
