"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself.

This is a fairly reasonable first offer, though slightly in Alice's favor. While I could reject and counter-offer in the next round, there are a few considerations:

1. The money's value doesn't decrease for me with inflation (0%)
2. $450,000 is a substantial amount
3. Rejecting might lead to a more confrontational negotiation
4. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds

Given these factors, and that the split is reasonably close to 50-50, I'll accept this offer.
