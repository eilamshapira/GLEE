"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) compared to my 5% per round, I should propose an offer that incentivizes early agreement while being fair enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges the time pressure we both face, particularly Bob who loses more value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a good deal for me as I'll receive $680,000, which is better than my initial proposal. With inflation affecting future rounds (5% less value for me per round), accepting this favorable offer now makes strategic sense rather than continuing negotiations where both our potential gains would decrease."
