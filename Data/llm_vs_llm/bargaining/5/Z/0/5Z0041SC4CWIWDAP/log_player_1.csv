"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair considering the inflation impact on your side is double mine. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

My $450,000 after 10% inflation is worth $405,000 in round 1 value.
Bob's $550,000 after 5% inflation is worth $522,500 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than round 1 value. That's a significant risk, and the next round would make Bob's share worth 10% less than round 1.

Given that Bob has acknowledged my need for a larger share due to higher inflation impact, and that waiting another round would significantly decrease the real value of any amount I receive, I should accept this offer.
