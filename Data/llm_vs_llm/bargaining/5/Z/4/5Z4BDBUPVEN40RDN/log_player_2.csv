"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for a better offer in the next round since the value of the money decreases more rapidly for Alice than for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""How about I get 55 and you get 45? It's still a good deal for you, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose 48 for me and 52 for you. It's a fair adjustment from my initial offer, taking into account the changes in value. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the inflation rates, this offer is reasonable and ensures I get a fair amount."
