"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The original amount I would get is $500,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 5% less, so it's $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

Considering this, I think the offer is reasonable.
