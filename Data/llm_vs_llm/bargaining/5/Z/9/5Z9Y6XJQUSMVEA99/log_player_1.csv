"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me, given my first-mover position.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 55-45 split, which gives me $5,500 and Bob $4,500. This is a reasonable offer that acknowledges the first-mover advantage while still being fair enough to have a good chance of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. For me, the $5000 is worth the full $5000
3. For Bob, due to 20% inflation, his $5000 is actually only worth $4000 to him
4. I could reject and make another offer, but the inflation might get worse for Bob in the next round
5. $5000 is a decent amount, even though it's less than my initial proposal

Given that this is a reasonable offer and continuing might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to inflation, I'll accept.
