"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation factor that affects me. Since with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me but not to Bob, I have an incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 for me and $50 for you. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts."
