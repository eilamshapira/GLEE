"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision.

She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would receive $400,000 and she would receive $600,000. While I could potentially negotiate for a more equal division in the next round, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's always risk in rejection.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
