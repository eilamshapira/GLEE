"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the inflation that affects me. Since it's Round 1, the full $100 value is still in effect for me. I'll propose a division that favors me slightly, anticipating that Bob might reject it and I need to leave room for negotiation in later rounds, considering the inflation.
