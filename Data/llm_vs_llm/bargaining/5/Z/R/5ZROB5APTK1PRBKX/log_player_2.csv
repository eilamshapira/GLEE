"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes into account Alice's 20% per round inflation penalty. Since she'll lose 20% of the value each round, she should be more willing to accept a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice faces 20% depreciation per round
2. If she rejects this offer, her next round's $1M will only be worth $800K to her
3. So $200K now is better for her than potentially getting less value in future rounds
4. This is still a significant amount of money for Alice while giving me a fair share"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure (already at 36% loss)
2. Each round makes the money worth less to her
3. I can make a more attractive counter-offer in the next round
4. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to be patient
5. She should be more willing to accept a better split for me in the next round, as her purchasing power continues to decrease"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice now faces 49.6% depreciation (1 - 0.8^3)
2. If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. $150,000 now is worth more to her than a larger amount in future rounds due to her severe inflation penalty
4. She should be motivated to accept soon as her negotiating position weakens each round
5. This offer still gives her a significant sum while maximizing my position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice is now facing a severe 59.04% inflation penalty
2. Her negotiating position is rapidly weakening (each round reduces her money's value by another 20%)
3. $700,000 for her is only worth about $286,000 in original value
4. I still have 7 rounds left and face no inflation penalty
5. I can make a more aggressive counter-offer in the next round, as she should be increasingly desperate to reach a deal before her value decreases further"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice now faces 67.2% depreciation (1 - 0.8^5)
2. $100,000 now is actually worth more to her than $700,000 in several rounds
3. If she rejects this, her next round's money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
4. With only 6 rounds left and her severe inflation penalty, she should be highly motivated to accept
5. Even though this is a more aggressive split, it's still rational for her to accept given her rapidly deteriorating position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice is now facing a devastating 73.79% inflation penalty
2. Her $600,000 is only worth about $157,260 in original value to her
3. We still have 5 rounds left
4. My money's value remains unchanged, so I can afford to wait
5. Given that her money loses another 20% in value each round, she's in an increasingly worse position to negotiate
6. I can make an even more favorable counter-offer next round, as she should be very motivated to avoid further value loss"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice now faces 79% depreciation (1 - 0.8^7)
2. $50,000 now is worth more to her than a larger amount several rounds later
3. If she rejects, any future gains will be worth drastically less due to the compounding 20% per round loss
4. With only 4 rounds left and her severe inflation penalty, accepting a smaller amount now is her best rational choice
5. The threat of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within the remaining rounds should make this offer more appealing
6. This amount still gives her a meaningful sum while maximizing my position given my strong negotiating position"
