"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer. Given that there's 5% inflation per round affecting my gains, I should aim for a good deal early, but not be too aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation while accounting for the inflation risk I face in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4500, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $4275
2. If I reject, my next offer will face 10% inflation for me
3. Bob seems to be facing higher inflation (20%), which explains his urgency
4. Having the next move could be advantageous, but the inflation will eat into my gains
5. $4275 is still a substantial amount, and the risk of further negotiations could lead to worse outcomes

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's a reasonable split considering the inflation effects, and the risk of continuing negotiations with increasing inflation doesn't justify rejection."
