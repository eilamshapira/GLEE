"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. I'm facing 20% inflation per round while you aren't, so this accounts for that disadvantage. If we delay too long, I'll lose significant value. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering your inflation disadvantage, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, I believe your initial offer was too skewed in your favor. This offer is more balanced, and we should both consider the risk of losing everything if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to account for my significant inflation disadvantage. With each round, I lose 20% of my value while you lose nothing. Let's meet in the middle between our offers. This 55/45 split is fair considering my time pressure and the declining value I face. Accepting now allows us both to walk away with a good deal rather than risking further rounds where my portion continues to devalue.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I still believe your offers are too favorable to you. Given that my portion of the money doesn't lose value, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal. This offer is slightly more in my favor, but it's still a significant amount for you, considering the circumstances. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable agreement before the 12 rounds are over. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000
