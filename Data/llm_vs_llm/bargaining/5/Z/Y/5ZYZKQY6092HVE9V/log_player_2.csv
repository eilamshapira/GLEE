Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a fairer split of the money. I understand that inflation affects both of us differently, so we should find a middle ground that works for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I notice inflation is affecting me more severely than you, Alice. Let's be practical - we both need to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value. This split acknowledges the inflation difference between us while still giving you a substantial amount. I hope we can agree and finalize this before further devaluation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

Alice, we're now in round 6 and the inflation is significantly impacting both of us, especially me. At this point, I need a larger share to offset my higher inflation rate (20% per round versus your 5%). If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both end up with nothing. This offer gives you 35% which, even with your lower inflation rate, is still substantial. Let's make a deal now before further devaluation occurs."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

Alice, we're now in round 8 with only 4 rounds left. The inflation impact on my share is nearly 80% by now, while yours is only about 30%. Given this severe asymmetry in how inflation affects us, I need a larger nominal amount to receive any meaningful value. This offer of 70/30 actually gives us roughly equal real value when accounting for our different inflation rates. Please consider accepting so we don't both end up with nothing."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

Alice, we're now in the final stages of negotiation with just 2 rounds left after this one. My inflation rate has reduced my purchasing power by over 85%, while yours is only around 35%. At this point, a 75/25 split is actually quite equitable when adjusted for our different inflation rates. If we don't reach an agreement very soon, we both get nothing. I hope you'll recognize that this offer is fair given our different circumstances and the urgency of our situation."
