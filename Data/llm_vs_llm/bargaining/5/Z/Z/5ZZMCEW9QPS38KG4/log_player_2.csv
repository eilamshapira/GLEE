"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is offering me $4000 out of the $10,000 total, which is 40%. While this isn't an even split, it's also not terribly unfair.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the total value to me would effectively be $9000 instead of $10,000. So my counter-offer would need to give me more than $4000 to be worthwhile.

Given the inflation penalty, I think I should try to negotiate for a better deal, as I could propose something like a 50-50 split next round (which would give me $4500 after inflation).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer while accounting for the 10% inflation that affects me in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5500 and Alice receives $4500. With the 10% inflation affecting me this round, my $5500 is effectively worth $4950 to me. This is better than the $4000 Alice offered me in round 1, while still giving Alice a respectable portion. I believe this is a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for both our interests and the inflation affecting me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $4000 to $4200. However, due to inflation, money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1. 

If I accept this offer, my $4200 would be effectively worth:
$4200 × (1 - 0.19) = $4200 × 0.81 = $3402

This is less than the effective value of Alice's first offer ($4000).

I also now know that Alice is affected by inflation too, and at a higher rate than me (36% vs my 19%). If we go to another round, her money will be worth even less.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll be making the offer but my inflation will increase further. And if Alice rejects again, we'll go to round 5 with even higher inflation for both of us.

Since Alice increased her offer slightly but not enough to overcome inflation, and considering we're both losing value with each round, I think it's best to negotiate one more time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 4 and both of us are experiencing significant inflation effects (mine at 19% and Alice's at 36% as of the previous round), I should make an offer that recognizes our mutual interest in concluding this negotiation before further value is lost.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I believe is fair and should be acceptable to Alice. With my inflation rate, $5000 is worth approximately $4050 to me (assuming inflation increases to about 19%). This is still better than the effective $3402 I would have received from Alice's last offer. 

Since Alice is experiencing even higher inflation (36%), a fair split now should be more attractive to her than continuing to future rounds where her gains would be worth even less."
