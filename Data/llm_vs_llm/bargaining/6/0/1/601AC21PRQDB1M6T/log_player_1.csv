"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My original money:** $60 in the first round.
*   **Inflation for me:** 10% reduction in value.
*   **My effective gain in this round:** The value of my money is now worth 90% of the original value.

So, if I accept the offer, my equivalent value is going to be: $40 * 0.9 = $36

Since I would gain less than the previous offer, I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, considering the inflation again. My money is now worth 10% less than last round, so it is worth 80% of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the effective value of the money for both of us considering the inflation.

*   **My inflation:** 27.1% reduction in value from Round 1.
*   **My original offer in round 1**: $60
*   **My effective gain in this round:** $45 * (1 - 0.271) = $45 * 0.729 = $32.805

Since my equivalent value is less than the offer I previously made, I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, let's make an offer for Round 5. The money is worth 10% less than the previous round, with respect to me, so the value of the money now is 65.61% of the original value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
