"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we move to another round, I lose 10% value due to inflation, which means I'd need more in nominal terms next round just to break even. This is a solid offer for both of us.""}"
