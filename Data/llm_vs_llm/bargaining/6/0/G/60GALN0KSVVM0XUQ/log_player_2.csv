"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 for each of us. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a proposal, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the entire $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round.

Even if I were to propose taking the entire $10,000 in the next round (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum potential gain would be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Since Alice is offering me $5,000 now, and that's more than 50% of what the money would be worth to me in the next round, this is actually a good offer from my perspective.
