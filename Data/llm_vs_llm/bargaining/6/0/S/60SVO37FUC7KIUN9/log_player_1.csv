"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 512821, ""bob_gain"": 487179, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me receiving $512,821 and you $487,179. This division reflects our future discounting effects, ensuring we both maximize our payoff if we settle now rather than risk further devaluation. I believe it's a fair and rational offer for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I propose we split the money equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we don't have to worry about further devaluation. It's a simple and fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
