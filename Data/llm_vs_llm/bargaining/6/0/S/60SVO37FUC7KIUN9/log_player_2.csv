"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me receiving $512821 and you $487179. This division reflects our future discounting effects, ensuring we both maximize our payoff if we settle now rather than risk further devaluation. I believe it's a fair and rational offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 487179 
# Alice gain: 512821
