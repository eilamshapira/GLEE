"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 50-50 split:
- I would get $500,000 now
- If I reject, any future amount will be worth 20% less to me
- Future amounts will only be worth 10% less to Alice
- This gives Alice a negotiating advantage in later rounds

If I reject, in the next round:
- The total value would be worth $800,000 to me
- Maximum I could get would be less than what I'm offered now

Given these factors, a 50-50 split is actually quite favorable for me. If I wait, I'll lose more value than Alice will.
