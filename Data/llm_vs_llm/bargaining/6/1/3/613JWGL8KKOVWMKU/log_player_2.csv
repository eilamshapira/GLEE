"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no financial penalty for me to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. However, a 50-50 split is generally considered fair.
