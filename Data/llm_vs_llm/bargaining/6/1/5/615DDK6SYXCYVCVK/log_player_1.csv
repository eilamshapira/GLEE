"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the 10% inflation effect on future rounds, trying to find a fair balance that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose we split the money with me receiving $5,500 and you receiving $4,500. I'm offering slightly more to myself since waiting would reduce the value for me due to inflation, but I'm still trying to be fair so we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer gives me significantly less than my initial proposal, and even with the 10% inflation impact, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is taking a more aggressive position, which suggests he may not be as affected by inflation as I am, or is willing to negotiate hard. Given that the money is now worth 20% less to me than in round 1, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a completely equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair and should be acceptable to both of us. While I'm receiving less than my initial offer, this 50-50 split represents a standard fair division and avoids further devaluation of my share due to inflation."
