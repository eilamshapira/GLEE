"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $90 total). While $40 isn't an equal split, it's still a significant amount, and trying to negotiate for more might result in both of us losing value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can propose a fairer split in the next round, even accounting for the 10% loss in value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but keeping in mind that we're now dealing with 90% of the original value. I want to be fair but also make an offer that Alice is likely to accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of $50 each. This is fair to both parties, and even though we've lost some value due to inflation, we both still get more than we would if we continue to negotiate and lose more value."
