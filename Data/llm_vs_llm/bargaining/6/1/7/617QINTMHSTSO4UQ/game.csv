6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face if we delay. If we go to the next round, I'll only get 80% of the value, so this split is actually fair for both of us. Let's settle this efficiently.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty you face, I'm willing to offer you 45% of the original amount. Since the value for you decreases with each round, I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Since we're now in round 3, I've already taken a 20% inflation hit once, so this offer actually gives me less value than my initial proposal. If we delay further, I'll lose even more to inflation. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering you've already taken two 20% inflation hits and will face even more if we delay, I'm willing to offer you 40% of the original amount. This is a generous offer given the circumstances, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept it now rather than risk further devaluation.",Bob,4,
