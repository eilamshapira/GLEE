"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face if we delay. If we go to the next round, I'll only get 80% of the value, so this split is actually fair for both of us. Let's settle this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty you face, I'm willing to offer you 45% of the original amount. Since the value for you decreases with each round, I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer. Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Since we're now in round 3, I've already taken a 20% inflation hit once, so this offer actually gives me less value than my initial proposal. If we delay further, I'll lose even more to inflation. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering you've already taken two 20% inflation hits and will face even more if we delay, I'm willing to offer you 40% of the original amount. This is a generous offer given the circumstances, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept it now rather than risk further devaluation.""}"
