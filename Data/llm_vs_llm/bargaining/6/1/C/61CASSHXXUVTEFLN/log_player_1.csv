"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll need to consider that inflation affects me by 20% each round, so I should offer a reasonable split to Bob to avoid losing more to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $350,000, which is a substantial amount. If you reject, inflation will reduce the total value for me by 20% next round, but not for you. This is a fair offer considering the structure of the game.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% inflation impact on your share each round, my offer of $400000 to you is still generous. I'm taking $600000, which I believe is fair given the game's dynamics. Let's end this now before your share loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer given the inflation dynamics. If I reject and go to round 3, the money will be worth another 20% less to me, meaning I would only receive 80% of the value of whatever amount we agree on.

Bob is offering me $400,000, which is currently worth $400,000 Ã— 0.8 = $320,000 in original round 1 value to me. If I reject and we go to round 3, I would need to secure a significantly larger share to overcome the additional inflation penalty.

Since Bob knows I face declining value with each round, and he doesn't face any inflation penalty, accepting now is better than risking further value loss.
