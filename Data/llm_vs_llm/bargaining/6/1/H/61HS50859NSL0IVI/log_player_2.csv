"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I receive $30 while she gets $70 out of the $100. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I should remember that the total amount will decrease by 10% to $90.

I think I can propose a more balanced split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that should be more appealing to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally at $50 each. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective benefit since we're now dealing with only $90 total due to the 10% inflation from the first round. An equal split is the most equitable solution at this point."
