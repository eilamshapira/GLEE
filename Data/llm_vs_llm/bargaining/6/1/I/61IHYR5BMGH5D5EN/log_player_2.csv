"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40 to account for my potential inflation losses in future rounds. This is a generous offer, let's take it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential earnings in future rounds. With 20% inflation per round affecting me, waiting could reduce my potential gain.

If I reject this offer and we go to the next round, the $10,000 would be worth effectively $8,000 to me due to 20% inflation. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, that would be $5,000, but worth $4,000 to me after inflation.

The current offer gives me $4,000, which is the same as what I might get in the best case next round, and there's a risk Alice would reject my counter-offer.
