"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 1, I understand that I need to make an offer to Bob on how to divide $100, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 5% in each subsequent round.

I should make a fair offer that Bob would likely accept, since waiting would cost me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair and should be acceptable to Bob. This way we both get an equal share, and I avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would occur if we moved to another round."
