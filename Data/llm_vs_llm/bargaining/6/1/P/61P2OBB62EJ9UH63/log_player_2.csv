"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 pot, keeping $6,000 for herself. I need to consider the inflation factor - if I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round when I make a counter-offer.

If I reject, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split then, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $4,000 now.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and $4,000 is a substantial portion of the total, I'll reject this offer to make my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's previous offer, I'll now make my counter-proposal. I need to balance fairness with the fact that I'm facing 10% inflation per round.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me slightly more than what Alice offered, while still being reasonable enough that Alice would likely accept rather than risk further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I now have important new information: Alice's inflation rate (36%) is actually much higher than mine (19%). This explains why she rejected my previous offer, as the delay hurts her more than it hurts me.

Let's analyze this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,500, which after 19% inflation is worth about $3,645 to me
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where my inflation would be even higher
- Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of her high inflation rate, as she improved her offer from $4,000 to $4,500

Given that Alice's inflation rate is significantly higher than mine, I have some leverage. However, if I reject again, the total value continues to decline for both of us. Since this is a reasonable improvement from her initial offer, and further delays might risk both of us losing more value:
