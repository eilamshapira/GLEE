"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000$ for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round for me
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation
4. Even if I could get a better deal in later rounds, the inflation penalty might offset any gains
5. 500,000$ right now is better than risking a worse outcome due to inflation

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk, I'll accept this fair offer.
