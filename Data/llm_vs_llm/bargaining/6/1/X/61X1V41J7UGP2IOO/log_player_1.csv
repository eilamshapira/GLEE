"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer, splitting the amount almost equally but giving Bob a slightly larger share as a gesture of goodwill.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this division because it's close to a 50-50 split, which is fair, but by offering Bob a bit more (52%), I show that I'm willing to be generous and cooperative. This should increase the likelihood of acceptance."
