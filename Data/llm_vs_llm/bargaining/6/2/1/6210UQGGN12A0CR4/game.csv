8500.0,1500.0,"Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I take $8500 and you get $1500. I believe it's best to agree now rather than risk further rounds which might impact the value. Accepting ensures you secure your share immediately without any waiting complications.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable and reasonable for both of us. The 5% inflation only affects me, but even with that, we should aim for fairness. Let's not waste time with extreme offers and settle on this balanced solution now.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 10% relative to round 1, meaning every dollar you get today is worth 0.9 of its full value. Looking ahead, if you wait for your turn in round 4 the discount will likely worsen further (possibly around 15%), reducing the value of any amount you secure. To avoid additional loss, I'm offering you $4800 today—which gives you an effective value of about $4320—while I take $5200. This offer reflects both the diminishing value on your side and the strategic need to finish the game promptly. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,3,
