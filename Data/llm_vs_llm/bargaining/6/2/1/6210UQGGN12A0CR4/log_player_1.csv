"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I take $8,500 and you get $1,500. I believe it's best to agree now rather than risk further rounds which might impact the value. Accepting ensures you secure your share immediately without any waiting complications.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable and reasonable for both of us. The 5% inflation only affects me, but even with that, we should aim for fairness. Let's not waste time with extreme offers and settle on this balanced solution now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 10% relative to round 1, meaning every dollar you get today is worth 0.9 of its full value. Looking ahead, if you wait for your turn in round 4 the discount will likely worsen further (possibly around 15%), reducing the value of any amount you secure. To avoid additional loss, I'm offering you $4800 today—which gives you an effective value of about $4320—while I take $5200. This offer reflects both the diminishing value on your side and the strategic need to finish the game promptly. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
