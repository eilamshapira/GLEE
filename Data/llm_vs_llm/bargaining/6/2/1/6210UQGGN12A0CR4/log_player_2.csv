"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I take $8500 and you get $1500. I believe it's best to agree now rather than risk further rounds which might impact the value. Accepting ensures you secure your share immediately without any waiting complications. 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite unbalanced. Given that inflation only affects me at 5% per round, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal. Even with several rounds of inflation, I could secure more than $1500.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable and reasonable for both of us. The 5% inflation only affects me, but even with that, we should aim for fairness. Let's not waste time with extreme offers and settle on this balanced solution now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 10% relative to round 1, meaning every dollar you get today is worth 0.9 of its full value. Looking ahead, if you wait for your turn in round 4 the discount will likely worsen further (possibly around 15%), reducing the value of any amount you secure. To avoid additional loss, I'm offering you $4800 today—which gives you an effective value of about $4320—while I take $5200. This offer reflects both the diminishing value on your side and the strategic need to finish the game promptly. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is much more reasonable this time. She's offering me $4800, which is close to the 50-50 split I proposed. She's correct that my gains are affected by inflation (though she slightly overestimated the discount at 10% when it's actually 9.75%). If I reject and wait for round 4, the inflation will indeed increase further.

This is a fair offer considering the inflation effect, and continuing to negotiate might result in diminishing returns for me.
