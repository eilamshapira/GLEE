35.71,64.29,"Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation I propose a fair offer: I keep $35.71 and you receive $64.29. This allocation gives you exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited (since in the next round you’d be proposer but face a 10% discount), so it makes sense to settle now. What do you think?",Alice,1,
