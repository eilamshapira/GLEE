"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation I propose a fair offer: I keep $35.71 and you receive $64.29. This allocation gives you exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited (since in the next round you’d be proposer but face a 10% discount), so it makes sense to settle now. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 64.29 
# Alice gain: 35.71 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
