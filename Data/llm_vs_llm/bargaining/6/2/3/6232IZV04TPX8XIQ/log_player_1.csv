"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. Bob should find this acceptable since waiting would mean losing value due to the 10% inflation per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this even split. Although it's slightly less favorable than my initial offer, due to the 10% inflation it's still better to accept now than to continue negotiating and lose more value. This is a fair outcome for both parties."
