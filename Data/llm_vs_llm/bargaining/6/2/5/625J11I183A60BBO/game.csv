600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. It's a generous offer considering the inflation I'll face in later rounds. Let's settle this quickly!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand you face 20% inflation per round, so time is more valuable to you. This split is fair considering that waiting another round would decrease your value significantly. If you reject, I'd have to ask for even more in round 3 to compensate for your further inflation loss. Let's settle this now with a deal that works for both of us.",Bob,2,
