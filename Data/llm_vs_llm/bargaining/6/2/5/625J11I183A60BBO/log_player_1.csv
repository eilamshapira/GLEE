Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you face 20% inflation per round, so time is more valuable to you. This split is fair considering that waiting another round would decrease your value significantly. If you reject, I'd have to ask for even more in round 3 to compensate for your further inflation loss. Let's settle this now with a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
