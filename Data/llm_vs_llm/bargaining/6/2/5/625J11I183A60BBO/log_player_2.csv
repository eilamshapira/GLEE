"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a generous offer considering the inflation I'll face in later rounds. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while she keeps $600,000. I need to consider if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer.

If I reject, I can make an offer in the next round. For Alice, money will be worth 20% less in the next round due to inflation, while my value remains the same. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I could potentially offer a split more favorable to me in the next round, and Alice might accept it because waiting further would decrease the value for her even more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that recognizes Alice's inflation constraint while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you face 20% inflation per round, so time is more valuable to you. This split is fair considering that waiting another round would decrease your value significantly. If you reject, I'd have to ask for even more in round 3 to compensate for your further inflation loss. Let's settle this now with a deal that works for both of us.""}"
