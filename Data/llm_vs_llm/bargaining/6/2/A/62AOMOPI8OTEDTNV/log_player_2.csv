Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is now worth:
- Bob: 420,000 * 0.81 = 340,200
- Alice: 580,000 * 0.64 = 371,200

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation rates, the value of the money for each player is now:
- Bob: 1,000,000 * 0.729 = 729,000
- Alice: 1,000,000 * 0.488 = 488,000

To make a fair offer considering the original values, I can propose:

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

This offer, considering inflation, is worth:
- Bob: 520,000 * 0.729 = 377,880
