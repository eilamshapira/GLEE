"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount and can conclude the deal quickly.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a split of 48% for me and 52% for you would be more favorable for both of us. Let's finalize this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offered me $520,000 (52%)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's share ($480,000) is actually worth 5% less to him than in round 1
3. My share maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we'll move to round 3, but future rounds might have more inflation impact on Bob
5. This is a reasonable offer that gives me the majority share
