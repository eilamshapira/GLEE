Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 48 * 0.64 = 30.72 (since it's 36% less than the original value). 
Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not favorable to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing for me. I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 49 * 0.4096 = 20.06 (since it's 59.04% less than the original value). 

Given this significant decrease in value, I think I should accept Alice's offer to get something rather than risking further inflation.
