"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance. However, I know that Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't lose any value. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- My $50 would still be worth $50 to me
- Her $50 would only be worth $47.50 to her

This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round since the money is worth less to her. I could propose a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the depreciation effect.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I know Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round, I can propose a split that's slightly in my favor while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept, given that waiting another round would cost her more value.

""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since waiting another round would decrease the value by 5% for you, this offer gives you $40 now which is better than waiting. It's a fair deal considering the time value.""}"
