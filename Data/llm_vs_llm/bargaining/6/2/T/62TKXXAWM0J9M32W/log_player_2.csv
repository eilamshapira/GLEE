"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a fair 50-50 split, which is reasonable. However, I need to consider inflation - if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will be 5% less for me in the next round. There's no guarantee that Alice would accept a better offer from me, and further delays would only reduce the money's value further.
