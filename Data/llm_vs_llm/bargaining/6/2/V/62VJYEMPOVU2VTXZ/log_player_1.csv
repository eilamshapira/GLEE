"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly different split? 55 for me and 45 for you. It's still a good deal, especially considering we're losing money to inflation each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
