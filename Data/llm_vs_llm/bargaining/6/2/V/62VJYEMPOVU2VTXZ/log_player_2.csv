Round 2

{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""My turn! How about a slightly different split? 55 for me and 45 for you. It's still a good deal, especially considering we're losing money to inflation each round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we split it with me getting 55 and you getting 45? This way, we both get a fair share, and it's better than prolonging the game and losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
