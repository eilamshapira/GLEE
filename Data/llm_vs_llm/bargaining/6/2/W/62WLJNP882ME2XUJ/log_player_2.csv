"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally to maximize our combined gains. With inflation at 20% per round, any further rounds will reduce the total value significantly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But total value drops to $800,000 due to 20% inflation
   * Even if I propose a very favorable split for myself, Alice might reject
   * Further rounds would reduce value even more

This is actually a very reasonable offer. With the inflation penalty, trying to negotiate for a better deal could leave us both worse off. A fair split in round 1 maximizes our combined outcome.
