"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. A 40$ gain is decent, but I could potentially get more
3. However, if I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, so my next proposal would need to be significantly better to make up for the loss
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, Alice might reject, leading to further inflation

Given that 40$ without inflation is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where each round reduces the money's value by 10%, I should accept this offer.
