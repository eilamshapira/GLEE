"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I propose to take $60 and give Bob $40. This is a fair starting point that gives both of us a substantial amount, but it's also strategic as it gives me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Explanation: Considering the inflation, I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45. This offer is still advantageous to me but is more balanced given the decreasing value of the money."
