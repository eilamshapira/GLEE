55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This seems reasonable given that I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't. If we delay, I'll get less value from the same dollar amount, so it's in both our interests to agree now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, if you reject now, you'll be the proposer in Round 3, but your dollars will be worth only 80% due to inflation, and you'll be forced to offer Bob almost everything since he never loses value. Accepting now, even though it's nearly all in my favor, guarantees you 0.01, which is all you can realistically get. Let's settle immediately.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, your previous offer was extremely unfair. While I do face inflation, it's only 20% at this point, not catastrophic. This is a fair 50-50 split which still gives me reasonable value. If you reject, we'll go to round 4 where you'll propose, but if you try another extremely unfair offer, I'll reject again. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now with a fair division.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, by rejecting further, the inflation penalty will only worsen the value of your share. In round 5 you would be the proposer, but the discount you'd face would leave you with even less real value. Accepting this offer now secures you $1, which is far better than risking a near-zero outcome in a prolonged game. Let's end this on a practical note—your move.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I see your strategy is to try to exploit the inflation penalty, but this isn't productive for either of us. At this point, I'm offering you the majority (55%) while taking less (45%) to account for the inflation factor. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits you while still giving me fair value. If you reject and we continue this pattern, we'll both waste time and potentially end up with nothing. Let's conclude with this balanced offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of your money. At round 7, when you would be the proposer, you'll be forced to offer almost everything to me in order to secure my acceptance, leaving you virtually empty‐handed. Accepting this offer now guarantees you a small, immediate gain rather than risking an outcome that's effectively zero. Let's wrap this up.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, your strategy of offering me virtually nothing isn't working. I'm willing to continue rejecting unfair offers. Consider that even with the inflation penalty, receiving a reasonable portion is better than dragging this out indefinitely. I'm actually offering you a solid $40 with no strings attached. If you continue this pattern of extreme offers, we'll both waste more time. Let's be practical and reach an agreement that acknowledges both our positions.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I believe we’re both better off if we move forward. Given that if I reject this round, I’ll have the opportunity to propose in the next round—and since your share will suffer an even steeper inflation hit (approximately 52% devaluation)—I can secure a division where you receive almost nothing and I nearly the entire sum. While $40 is affirmative, it’s far less than what I can ensure for myself in the following round. I’m opting to reject your current proposal.",Bob,7,reject
90.0,10.0,"Alice, notice that if you reject this offer, you'll move to round 9, where your nominal dollars will be devalued by about 56.95% (since 0.9^8 ≈ 0.4305), meaning that even if you secured nearly all of the $100 then, its real value would be around $43. By accepting this offer in round 8, you receive $90 nominal, which at the current discount factor (0.9^7 ≈ 0.4783) is worth about $43 – essentially matching your best alternative. This offer eliminates further delay and guarantees you the best you can realistically get. I urge you to accept and conclude our negotiation now.",Bob,8,
