Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further losses from discounting. By accepting this deal now, you secure $400000 in current value rather than risking even greater value erosion in later rounds. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance given the situation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
