"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that gives both of us a substantial portion, but considering I'm first and there's inflation risk for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose we split it $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer that gives us both a significant amount while acknowledging the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3200 to me
2. If I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation (another 20% loss for me)
3. Bob's position is stronger since inflation affects him less (only 10%)
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the declining value makes it less attractive

Given the asymmetric inflation and the significant loss of value if we continue to the next round, I'll accept this offer.
