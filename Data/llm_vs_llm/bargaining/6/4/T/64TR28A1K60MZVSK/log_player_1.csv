"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being generous enough for Bob to consider accepting. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion ($45) to encourage a quick agreement and avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's effectively worth $47.50 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but will face another 5% inflation penalty
3. The offer is fair in nominal terms (50-50 split)
4. Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation on my side

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the offer because a guaranteed $47.50 in real value now is better than risking further deterioration of my purchasing power in subsequent rounds."
