"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is for me to get $45 while she gets $55. This is slightly in her favor, but it's a reasonable first offer. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by waiting. However, if I reject, I risk getting into a stalemate that could result in both of us getting nothing after 12 rounds.

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money since that would be fair to both of us. A 50-50 split is the most equitable division, and I hope Alice will recognize this as a reasonable compromise."
