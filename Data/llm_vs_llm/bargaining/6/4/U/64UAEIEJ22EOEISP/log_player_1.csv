Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn now. I propose we divide the $100 by giving you $1 and keeping $99 for myself. I know it seems lopsided, but consider that if you reject, you'll have to put together your own proposal in the next round – and by then, your share's value drops by an extra 5% (effectively making nearly everything go to Bob). Accepting this deal now secures you a positive amount, whereas waiting forces you into a corner. Looking forward to settling this today. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's my turn to propose. Given that every round you face further depreciation—your current $6 is worth about 0.8574 of its face value (roughly $5.14 in round‑1 terms) while in round 5 it would drop to about 0.8145—this is your best chance to secure anything significant. I’m offering $6 for you and keeping $94 for myself. Accepting now avoids extra loss on your part, so let's settle and avoid risking both of us ending up with nothing.

A 50/50 split is fair, avoids further losses, and ensures we both get something. This is my final 'reasonable' offer.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 6 and time is not on our side—your share loses another 5% in value this round, making every dollar you hold even less precious. I'm offering you $4 now, which is secure compared to the risk of further devaluation if we delay. Accepting this offer means you lock in what little value remains, while further rounds will only erode your amount further. I urge you to agree so we can both walk away with something rather than nothing.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we settle this round with you receiving $3 and I take $97. At this point, inflation means your dollars are worth about 33% less than their original value; in effect, $3 now is roughly equivalent to $2 in round‑1 terms. If we delay further, you'll face even steeper devaluation, and your share may shrink to almost nothing. I urge you to accept this offer now to salvage as much value as possible.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re now at round 10 and every extra round further erodes the value of your share—by now your dollars are worth roughly 40% less than in round 1. That means accepting $1 today preserves about 60 cents of value for you, whereas waiting only leads to an even steeper discount. I urge you to consider that if we drag this out to round 11 or 12, you stand to lose even more. Let’s end this now with this offer—it's the best you can secure at this stage.
