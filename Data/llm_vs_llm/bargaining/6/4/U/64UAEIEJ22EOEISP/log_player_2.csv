"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40 to account for the inflation I'll face in later rounds if we don't agree now. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn now. I propose we divide the $100 by giving you $1 and keeping $99 for myself. I know it seems lopsided, but consider that if you reject, you'll have to put together your own proposal in the next round – and by then, your share's value drops by an extra 5% (effectively making nearly everything go to Bob). Accepting this deal now secures you a positive amount, whereas waiting forces you into a corner. Looking forward to settling this today.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that was a ridiculous offer. I understand the inflation is affecting me, but I'm not taking 1 dollar. How about we split it 55/45? It's a significant concession on my part considering the inflation. It's better than dragging this out and both of us potentially getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 94, ""alice_gain"": 6, ""message"": ""Alice, it's my turn to propose. Given that every round you face further depreciation—your current $6 is worth about 0.8574 of its face value (roughly $5.14 in round‑1 terms) while in round 5 it would drop to about 0.8145—this is your best chance to secure anything significant. I’m offering $6 for you and keeping $94 for myself. Accepting now avoids extra loss on your part, so let's settle and avoid risking both of us ending up with nothing.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting absurd. Your offers are insulting. Let's just split it 50/50. The inflation is hurting me, yes, but you're clearly trying to take advantage of that. A 50/50 split is fair, avoids further losses, and ensures we both get something. This is my final 'reasonable' offer.

I'm offering you $4 now, which is secure compared to the risk of further devaluation if we delay. Accepting this offer means you lock in what little value remains, while further rounds will only erode your amount further. I urge you to agree so we can both walk away with something rather than nothing.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm lowering my offer again, even though you're being completely unreasonable. I'll take $45, you take $55. The inflation is killing me, and I need to try and salvage something here. This is still a decent amount considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it, because next round, I might just offer you $1.

Round 8

At this point, inflation means your dollars are worth about 33% less than their original value; in effect, $3 now is roughly equivalent to $2 in round‑1 terms. If we delay further, you'll face even steeper devaluation, and your share may shrink to almost nothing. I urge you to accept this offer now to salvage as much value as possible.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

The inflation has severely impacted me, and I'm trying to avoid us both getting nothing. This is as low as I'm willing to go to still feel like I'm getting something worthwhile.

Round 10

That means accepting $1 today preserves about 60 cents of value for you, whereas waiting only leads to an even steeper discount. I urge you to consider that if we drag this out to round 11 or 12, you stand to lose even more. Let’s end this now with this offer—it's the best you can secure at this stage.""}"
