6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $6000 and you get $4000. Given that every round reduces the value of our money by 20%, it makes sense to settle now rather than risk further losses. I believe this division fairly reflects the advantage of acting immediately. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
