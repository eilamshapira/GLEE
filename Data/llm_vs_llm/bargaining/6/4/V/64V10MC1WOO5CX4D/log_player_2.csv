"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $6000 and you get $4000. Given that every round reduces the value of our money by 20%, it makes sense to settle now rather than risk further losses. I believe this division fairly reflects the advantage of acting immediately. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
