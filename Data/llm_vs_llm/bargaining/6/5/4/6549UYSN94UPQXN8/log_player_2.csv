"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's 60-40 split offer or reject it and make my own proposal.

While a 60-40 split gives me $40, which is substantial, I have the opportunity to propose what might be a more favorable split for myself in the next round. Since we have 12 rounds available, there's room for negotiation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both get an equal share, which is the most equitable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we compromise? I'll take 55 and you take 45. This is closer to your fair split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, which is a step toward my proposed equal division. While not fully at the 50-50 I proposed, she has compromised by reducing her share by 5%.

Given that we have plenty of rounds left (9 more after this one), and she's showing willingness to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Thanks for moving closer to an equal split. I still believe 50-50 is the fairest division. We're both equal participants in this game, so I think we should receive equal shares. This way neither of us has an advantage over the other.""}"
