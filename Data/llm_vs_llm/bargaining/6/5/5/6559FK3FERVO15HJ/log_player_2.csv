Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you than my first one 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her first one, and with inflation eating into my share, waiting isn't helping. I need to push for a more significant change in my favor."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one.  Alice is right, I'm losing ground fast. But her offer is barely better than the last one.  I have to gamble that she'll be more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this drags on.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was a good try, but I know the inflation is killing your value. This is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is frustrating, but I need to cut my losses.  The inflation is eating away at any potential gains, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Alice at this point."
