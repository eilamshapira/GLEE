"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, it's fair and square. Next round the money will be worth less due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual value of the offer is:
500000 * 0.95 = 475000

Considering this, I think splitting it equally is a reasonable offer, especially since the value will decrease further in the next round.
