60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair split.  I'm happy to take a bit less to get things going.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Given the inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this round. Let's settle this quickly before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's be reasonable. Inflation affects us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,Inflation is hitting me harder each round. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the significant decrease in value on my side. Let's end this soon.,Bob,4,
