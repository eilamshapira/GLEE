"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while she would get $55. 

I should remember that:
1. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round
2. The money doesn't lose value for me between rounds (0% inflation)
3. Alice faces 20% inflation per round, so money is worth less to her if we delay

Since Alice faces significant inflation and I don't, I have leverage to potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. I could reasonably ask for more than $45 in the next round, and Alice would have incentive to accept due to her inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my own proposal. Because Alice faces 20% inflation per round while I face none, I have some negotiating leverage. From Alice's perspective, waiting another round would make each dollar worth only 80% of its current value.

I'll propose a division that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice would prefer accepting now rather than making a counter-offer and losing value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm suggesting this split because $40 now for Alice is worth more than potentially getting a bit more in the next round when it would be devalued by 20%."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering an even 50-50 split of the $100, which means I would get $50.

Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice is now facing 36% inflation (after two rounds of 20% each)
2. I still face 0% inflation
3. If I reject, we go to round 4 where I make another offer
4. In round 4, Alice would face even more inflation (about 49% total)

Since Alice has increased her offer from $45 to $50 for me, and she's already facing significant inflation, this seems like a reasonable improvement. While I could potentially get more by rejecting again, Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and $50 is a fair split.
