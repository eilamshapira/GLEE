"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000 (if Alice accepts)
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The 60-40 split isn't exactly equal, but:
- It's a reasonable first offer
- The inflation penalty makes waiting risky
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
