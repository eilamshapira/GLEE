45.0,55.0,"Alice, by rejecting your recent proposal we're both facing further depreciation. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you in round 2 means you'll secure $45 at 80% value (i.e., $36 in real terms) now, which is better than risking even lower real value if we extend this to round 3. I believe this slight advantage for me fairly reflects the different inflation rates we're facing. I hope you'll agree to settle now.",Bob,2,
