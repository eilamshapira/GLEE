"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

  ""message"": ""Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $40. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering potential inflation in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting your recent proposal we're both facing further depreciation. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you in round 2 means you'll secure $45 at 80% value (i.e., $36 in real terms) now, which is better than risking even lower real value if we extend this to round 3. I believe this slight advantage for me fairly reflects the different inflation rates we're facing. I hope you'll agree to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
