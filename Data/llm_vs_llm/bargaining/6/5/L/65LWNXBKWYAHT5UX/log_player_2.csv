"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $40. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering potential inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, by rejecting your recent proposal we're both facing further depreciation. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you in round 2 means you'll secure $45 at 80% value (i.e., $36 in real terms) now, which is better than risking even lower real value if we extend this to round 3. I believe this slight advantage for me fairly reflects the different inflation rates we're facing. I hope you'll agree to settle now.""}"
