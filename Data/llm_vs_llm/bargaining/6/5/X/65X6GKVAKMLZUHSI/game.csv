500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of the money, which is fair for both of us. Since there's no inflation affecting me, this even split represents the same value throughout all rounds. Let's agree and both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing.",Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,I'm taking advantage of the inflation to secure a larger share for myself. This offer gives you a good starting point. We can negotiate further if you reject.,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand you're affected by inflation, but your previous offer was quite unbalanced. This offer gives you $400000 which, even with 20% inflation per round, is still substantial. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. Let's reach an agreement before the value diminishes further for you.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to concede a bit, but I need a larger share to offset the inflation.  This offer is fair, considering the diminishing value of the money for me.",Bob,4,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I see you're moving toward a more balanced split, which I appreciate. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous offer. This proposal gives you $450000, which is substantial even with the inflation you're experiencing. We're now only $100000 apart in our positions, so let's find a resolution rather than risk further devaluation or potentially getting nothing in the end.",Alice,5,
