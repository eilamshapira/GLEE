"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that strikes a balance between fairness and mutual benefit.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of the money, which is fair for both of us. Since there's no inflation affecting me, this even split represents the same value throughout all rounds. Let's agree and both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking advantage of the inflation to secure a larger share for myself. This offer gives you a good starting point. We can negotiate further if you reject. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're affected by inflation, but your previous offer was quite unbalanced. This offer gives you $400,000 which, even with 20% inflation per round, is still substantial. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. Let's reach an agreement before the value diminishes further for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to concede a bit, but I need a larger share to offset the inflation.  This offer is fair, considering the diminishing value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I see you're moving toward a more balanced split, which I appreciate. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous offer. This proposal gives you $450,000, which is substantial even with the inflation you're experiencing. We're now only $100,000 apart in our positions, so let's find a resolution rather than risk further devaluation or potentially getting nothing in the end.""
