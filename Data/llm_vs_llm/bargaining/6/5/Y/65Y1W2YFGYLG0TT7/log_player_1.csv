"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The original amount offered to me is $500,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less, so it's worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and we're already in the 3rd round, I need to consider that when making my offer.

In the first round, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In the second round, the money was worth 90% of its value to me.
In the third round, the money is worth 80% of its value to me (90% * 0.9).

For Bob, the money is worth 95% of its value in the second round, and 90% of its value in the third round (95% * 0.95).

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The original amount offered to me is $450,000, but due to inflation, it's worth $450,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $450,000 * 0.729 = $328,050 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor, but I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease if I reject the offer.
