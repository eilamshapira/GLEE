"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, while I don't
4. This means her $800,000 would be worth $640,000 to her next round
5. I'm in a stronger negotiating position since inflation doesn't affect me

Given these factors, I should reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split next round, and Alice will be under more pressure to accept due to the depreciation effect.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I'm not affected by inflation but Alice loses 20% value each round, I'll make a strategic offer that's better for me than her initial proposal, but still reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is more balanced than Alice's initial proposal. My reasoning:
1. If Alice rejects, her potential $400,000 will be worth only $320,000 to her next round
2. We still have 10 rounds left, but each round decreases the value significantly for her
3. This is a fair enough offer that shows I'm willing to compromise while taking advantage of my stronger position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $360,000, which is better than her first offer of $200,000
2. She would keep $640,000, but due to 36% inflation, it's only worth $409,600 to her
3. If I reject, next round her money will be worth 48% less than the first round
4. I'm still in a strong position since inflation doesn't affect me
5. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting, as the inflation pressure on Alice increases

Given that I can still make a better offer next round and Alice's position continues to weaken due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money is now worth 48% less to her than in round 1, I'll make a strategic offer that takes this into account:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

My reasoning:
1. For Alice, the $300,000 is actually worth only $156,000 due to 48% inflation
2. If she rejects, next round her money will be worth 56% less
3. We still have 8 rounds left, but the depreciation is becoming very significant for her
4. My previous offer of 600k/400k was rejected, but now the inflation pressure is much higher
5. This offer reflects my stronger negotiating position while still leaving Alice with a meaningful amount

She should seriously consider accepting this offer because waiting longer will significantly reduce the real value she receives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $460,000, which is significantly better than her previous offers
2. Her $540,000 share would only be worth $221,184 to her (due to 59.04% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round inflation will be around 67% for her
   - I can make another offer where I can get even more
   - I'm still completely protected from inflation
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Alice's negotiating position continues to weaken dramatically

While this is her best offer yet, given that I'm in an increasingly stronger position and her money is rapidly devaluing, I'll reject this offer. I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now worth 67.2% less to her than in round 1, I'll make the following offer:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

My reasoning:
1. For Alice, the $200,000 is actually worth only $65,600 due to 67.2% inflation
2. If she rejects, next round her money will be worth 73.8% less
3. We have 6 rounds left, but at this point the inflation is severely impacting her potential gains
4. My previous offer of 700k/300k was rejected, but now:
   - The inflation pressure is much more severe
   - She's made increasingly larger offers to me (up to 460k)
   - Her last offer shows she's willing to take a smaller share
5. This offer reflects the reality that waiting longer will make any amount worth significantly less to her

She should strongly consider accepting this offer because further delays will make any future amount she receives worth very little to her due to the compounding inflation effect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $600,000, which is her highest offer yet
2. Her $400,000 share would only be worth $104,840 to her (due to 73.79% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round inflation will be around 79% for her
   - I can make another offer where I can get even more
   - I'm still completely protected from inflation
4. We still have 5 rounds left
5. Her last rejection of my 800k/200k offer seems risky for her given the severe inflation

While $600,000 is a substantial offer, given that I'm in an extremely strong position and her money is severely devalued, I'll reject this offer. I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round, as her position is becoming desperate due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now worth 79% less to her than in round 1, I'll make the following offer:

{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

My reasoning:
1. For Alice, the $150,000 is actually worth only $31,500 due to 79% inflation
2. If she rejects, next round her money will be worth 83.2% less
3. We have only 4 rounds left
4. She's already shown willingness to offer me $600,000 in the last round
5. The inflation effect is now extremely severe - waiting another round would be very costly for her
6. She has rejected my previous 800k/200k offer, but the situation has deteriorated significantly for her since then

She should very seriously consider accepting this offer because:
- Further delays will make any amount almost worthless to her
- We're running out of rounds
- The risk of getting nothing (if we reach round 12) is becoming real
- Even a larger share in future rounds would be worth less to her due to compound inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $700,000, her highest offer yet
2. Her $300,000 share would only be worth $50,340 to her (due to 83.22% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round inflation will be around 86.6% for her
   - I can make another offer where I can get even more
   - I still have complete protection from inflation
4. Only 3 rounds remain
5. She's demonstrating increasing desperation with higher offers to me
6. My last offer of 850k/150k was rejected, but her position has weakened further

Given that:
- We're nearing the end (only 3 rounds left)
- She's clearly willing to make larger concessions
- Her money is now worth less than 17% of its original value
- The risk of mutual zero payoff is increasing

I will still reject this offer. With only a few rounds left and such severe inflation, I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now worth 86.6% less to her than in round 1, and we only have 2 rounds left after this, I'll make the following offer:

{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

My reasoning:
1. For Alice, the $100,000 is actually worth only $13,400 due to 86.6% inflation
2. If she rejects:
   - Next round inflation will be around 89.3% for her
   - Only 2 rounds remain
   - The risk of both getting nothing is becoming very real
3. She's already shown willingness to offer me $700,000 in the last round
4. The inflation effect is now catastrophic - waiting another round would make any amount almost worthless to her
5. With only 2 rounds left after this, she must seriously consider accepting to avoid the risk of getting nothing

She should accept this offer because:
- We're running out of time (only 2 rounds left)
- The risk of both getting zero (if we reach round 12) is very high
- Even a larger share in the final rounds would be worth extremely little to her due to the severe inflation
- Any further delay makes her position even worse"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:

1. Alice is offering me $800,000, her highest offer yet
2. Her $200,000 share would only be worth $21,480 to her (due to 89.26% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - This is the LAST chance, as next round will be round 12
   - If we don't agree in the final round, we BOTH get NOTHING
   - While I could make one final offer, there's significant risk Alice might reject out of spite
4. $800,000 is a very good offer for me, close to my last proposal of 900k/100k
5. The risk of getting nothing is now imminent

Given that:
- This is a very good offer ($800,000)
- There's only one round left
- The risk of getting nothing is very high if I reject
- The difference between this offer and my ideal outcome is not worth the risk

I will accept this offer. While I might get slightly more in the final round, the risk of getting nothing is too high to justify rejection.
