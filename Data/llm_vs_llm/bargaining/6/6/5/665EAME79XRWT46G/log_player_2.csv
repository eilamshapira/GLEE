"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer. However, inflation will reduce the value of the money for me by 5% and for Alice by 20%.

In the next round, $100 would be worth $95 to me and only $80 to Alice. This gives me leverage in negotiations because Alice faces higher inflation.

I think I can propose a better split in the next round that would still be acceptable to Alice due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 2, I need to consider the inflation effects. For Alice, money is now worth 20% less, so she's more incentivized to accept a reasonable offer now rather than delaying further.

I'll propose a more balanced split that still gives me an advantage but should be acceptable to Alice given her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is a more balanced division that gives me a bit more than half while still offering Alice a substantial amount. Given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round versus my 5%, this should be an attractive offer for her to accept now rather than facing further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice has rejected my 55/45 split offer and is now proposing a 45/55 split in her favor. I need to consider both the current offer and future inflation effects.

Current situation:
- Alice is offering me $45 (worth about 9.75% less to me than in round 1)
- If I reject, in the next round money will be worth about 14.75% less to me, and 56% less to Alice compared to round 1

Since Alice is facing much steeper inflation (20% per round vs my 5%), she should be more eager to reach an agreement soon. The fact that she rejected my 55/45 offer suggests she's willing to risk further rounds despite her higher inflation rate.

Given that I face lower inflation, I can afford to be more patient. By rejecting now, I can make a new offer in round 4 that accounts for our different inflation positions.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 4, I need to recognize that Alice and I are both losing value with each passing round, though she's losing value much faster. The money is now worth about 14.75% less to me and 56% less to Alice compared to round 1.

Given Alice's higher inflation rate, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to her than my previous one, but still advantageous to me.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing I get $52 and Alice gets $48. This is more balanced than my previous offer and recognizes Alice's need to reach an agreement sooner due to her higher inflation rate. It still gives me a slight advantage, but it's reasonable enough that Alice should consider accepting rather than facing another 20% devaluation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering a 50/50 split after rejecting my 52/48 offer. Let me analyze this carefully.

Current situation:
- Alice offers me $50 (worth 18.55% less to me than in round 1)
- The money is worth 59.04% less to Alice than in round 1
- If I reject, in round 6 money will be worth ~23.55% less to me and ~69.04% less to Alice compared to round 1

Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (asking for $60, then $55, now $50). The 50/50 split is fair on its face, but given our different inflation rates, time benefits me more than Alice.

However, we're already in round 5 of 12, and the diminishing returns from further negotiation may not be worth the risk. Alice has demonstrated willingness to continue despite her higher inflation rate.

The 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point, and continuing could lead to both of us losing more value.
