6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I’d like to settle quickly to avoid any potential surprises with the inflation effects—even though my money isn’t reduced, I’m not sure about yours. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle quickly. However, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation effect on my end, I'd like to propose a more balanced split. Let's meet closer to the middle.",Bob,2,

9900.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, considering that in Round 3 your money's nominal value will be worth 20% less than in Round 1, any delay puts you at a huge disadvantage. If you reject, you’ll be forced into a position in the next round where you'll have to offer almost the entire pie to me to get anything at all. To avoid further erosion of your payoff due to inflation, I'm offering you $100 nominal—worth $80 in today’s terms—while I take $9900. I believe this is the best (and only) way for you to secure a positive value rather than risk getting nearly nothing later. I hope you’ll agree to settle on these terms.",Alice,3,

2000.0,8000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation effect, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Your offer was extremely one-sided, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal. I'm making a bold offer this time, hoping you'll consider the possibility of me walking away with nothing if we don't settle soon. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between.",Bob,4,

9700.0,300.0,"Hi Bob, we're now at Round 5 and the inflation on your share is accelerating—if we drag this out, you'll face an even steeper discount (around 35% less real value) in the next round. I'm offering you $300 nominal, which secures you a better deal than waiting and risking almost nothing, while I take $9700. This is a final opportunity to settle on terms that safeguard some value for you. Let's end this negotiation now before the discount takes an even heavier toll.",Alice,5,
