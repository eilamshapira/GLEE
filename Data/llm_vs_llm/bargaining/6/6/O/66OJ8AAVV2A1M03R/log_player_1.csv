"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about proposing first, but I also face 5% inflation per round. Let's be more balanced - I propose 52/48 in my favor. This way we can conclude quickly and both walk away with a good amount without risking further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
