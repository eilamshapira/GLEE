"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I propose a 55/45 split, a slight advantage for me to account for my having to propose first. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she takes $550,000. Her reasoning is that she deserves a slight advantage for proposing first.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me. If I propose a 50/50 split then, I could potentially get $475,000, which is better than the current offer.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, which could leave me with less than the current offer.

Given this is just the first round and I have bargaining power, I'll reject this offer and propose something better in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being favorable to both of us.
