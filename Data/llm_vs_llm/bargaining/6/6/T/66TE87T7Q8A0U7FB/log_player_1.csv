"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose an offer that takes into account the 20% depreciation per round for Bob. Since Bob's money loses value each round, he might be more inclined to accept a smaller amount now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to give Bob $400,000 (40%) and keep $600,000 (60%) for myself. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, any money he gets in the next round will be worth 20% less to him. It's in his interest to accept this reasonable split now rather than risk getting less value later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

For Bob, his $500,000 is actually only worth $400,000 (80% of original value) due to the 20% inflation on his side.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- For Bob, the money will be worth only 60% of original value
- I could potentially get more than $500,000
- However, Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds and potentially worse outcomes

$500,000 is a fair split for me (it's 50% of the original amount), and I know that Bob is already experiencing reduced value on his side.
