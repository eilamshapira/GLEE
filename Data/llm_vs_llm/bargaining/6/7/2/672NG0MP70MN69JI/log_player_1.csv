"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on me, I propose this division. This way, I effectively get around $4500 while you get $5500. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses for me. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is that Bob's offer is fair. While he asks for $4500 nominally, due to the 20% inflation on his end, it's actually worth less to him (around $3600 in round 1 value). Meanwhile, I get $5500 which is close to my initial proposal and isn't affected by inflation. Continuing to later rounds would only weaken Bob's position due to inflation, making it harder to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a reasonable compromise."
