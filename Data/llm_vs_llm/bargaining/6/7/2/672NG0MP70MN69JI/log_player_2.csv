"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the inflation impact. I offer you $4000 which is a reasonable portion given that waiting will reduce the value for you by 20% each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's consider the impact of inflation on my share. If I accept Alice's offer now, I get $4000. However, if I reject and make a counteroffer next round, the value of the money for me will decrease by 20%. Therefore, I need to consider this loss when making my decision.

In the next round, I could propose a split that takes into account the 20% decrease in value for me. For example, if I were to propose a 50-50 split, I would effectively be getting $4500 in the next round.

Since $4500 (effective value next round) is more than $4000 (current offer), it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact on me, I propose this division. This way, I effectively get around $4500 while you get $5500. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses for me.""}

In this round, I proposed a division where I get $4500 and Alice gets $5500. This takes into account the 20% decrease in value for me due to inflation. I've also sent a message to Alice explaining my reasoning and encouraging her to accept the offer to avoid further losses for me in subsequent rounds."
