"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- I'm offered $45 out of $100
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
- $45 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $45 due to inflation)
- This is a reasonably fair split considering the inflation pressure
