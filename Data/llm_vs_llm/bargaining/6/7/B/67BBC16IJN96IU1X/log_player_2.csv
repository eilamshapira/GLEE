"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with a 60-40 ratio in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant amount while accounting for the risk of inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets 60% ($600,000) while I get 40% ($400,000). 

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to the 5% inflation, the total money would be worth $950,000 in the next round. 

While I could propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice could reject that and we'd lose another 5% in round 3. This back-and-forth could continue, reducing the total value significantly.

$400,000 is still a substantial amount, and accepting now guarantees that sum without further devaluation.
