"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000. While I appreciate her making an offer, a 60-40 split in her favor isn't particularly fair - an equal 50-50 split would be more reasonable. Since this is just the first round and the 5% inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I'll reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution.
