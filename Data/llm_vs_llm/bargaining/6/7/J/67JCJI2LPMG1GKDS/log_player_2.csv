"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. The offer is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be reduced by 5% for me. That means the $100 pot would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round.

Currently offered: $40
If I reject, maximum I could get next round: $95 (and Alice might reject)

While 40/60 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer considering:
1. I get a guaranteed $40 now
2. Any delay reduces the value for me
3. There's risk Alice won't accept a better offer in future rounds
