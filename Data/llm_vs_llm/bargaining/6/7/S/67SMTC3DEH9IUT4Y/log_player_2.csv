"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, while she gets $600,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), there's no pressure for me to accept immediately due to declining value. I could potentially make a counter-offer in the next round that's more favorable to me.

I believe I can propose a more balanced split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that gives us both a substantial portion of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is fair to both of us. This gives each of us $500,000, which is a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer. She's now offering me $450,000 (up from her initial $400,000) and keeping $550,000 for herself (down from $600,000).

It's interesting that Alice is experiencing inflation (19% less value for her since round 1), while I'm not affected by inflation. This explains why she's offering me more now - the money is becoming less valuable to her over time.

Since I don't face inflation pressure, I could reject and make another counteroffer. However, Alice is already moving in my direction, and if her inflation continues to increase, she may offer even better terms in a future round.

Given that she's improved her offer by $50,000 in my favor and may be motivated to conclude the negotiation due to her inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
