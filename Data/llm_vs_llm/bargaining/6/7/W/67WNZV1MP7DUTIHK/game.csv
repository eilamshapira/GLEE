600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects me less.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. While you do have a lower inflation rate, we both lose if we drag this out through multiple rounds. This even split gives us both substantial value now rather than diminished returns later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This considers both our inflation rates and finds a fair compromise.,Alice,3,
