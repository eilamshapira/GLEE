"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. While you do have a lower inflation rate, we both lose if we drag this out through multiple rounds. This even split gives us both substantial value now rather than diminished returns later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
