"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and her $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me (down to $900,000 total value from my perspective) and 5% for Alice (down to $950,000 from her perspective).

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, it might be better to accept now rather than lose value through inflation, especially since my inflation rate is higher. If we continue negotiating, my bargaining position weakens faster than hers.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round where I can propose a division that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make an offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. While you do have a lower inflation rate, we both lose if we drag this out through multiple rounds. This even split gives us both substantial value now rather than diminished returns later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This considers both our inflation rates and finds a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has improved her offer from 60-40 to 55-45, now offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000.

Due to inflation, the total value has already decreased significantly for me (19% less) and somewhat for Alice (9.75% less). If I reject and we go to another round, my inflation will increase to about 27% while Alice's will be around 15%.

Her offer of $450,000 now is worth more than what I might get after another round of inflation, even if I could negotiate a slightly better percentage. Further negotiation risks diminishing returns for both of us, and my position weakens faster due to my higher inflation rate.
