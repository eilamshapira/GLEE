377669.0,622331.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further loss of value due to inflation we should settle now. Based on backward induction—with every delay reducing the pot by 10%—if you reject my offer you’d expect to get about $622331 in the next round. I’m therefore offering you that amount and keeping $377669 for myself. I believe this is a fair split given the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,1,
