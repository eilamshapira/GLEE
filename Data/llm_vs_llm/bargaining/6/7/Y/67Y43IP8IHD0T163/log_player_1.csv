"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377669, ""bob_gain"": 622331, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further loss of value due to inflation we should settle now. Based on backward induction—with every delay reducing the pot by 10%—if you reject my offer you’d expect to get about $622,331 in the next round. I’m therefore offering you that amount and keeping $377,669 for myself. I believe this is a fair split given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
