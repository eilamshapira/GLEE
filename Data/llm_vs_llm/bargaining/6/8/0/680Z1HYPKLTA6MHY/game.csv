6000.0,4000.0,"Let's make a fair split that acknowledges my first-mover position. You get a substantial $4000 while I take $6000. Remember, delay will cost us both money due to inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation rates and the value decrease, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This split takes into account the urgency to settle and the fact that your money depreciates faster. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%), any delay hurts me more than you. I'm offering you $4500 and taking $5500 - a more balanced split than my first offer. This is fair considering both our positions. Let's avoid further devaluation and agree now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of the money, especially for you at 10% per round, my offer of $6000 for me and $4000 for you is a compromise that reflects the urgency of the situation. Let's settle now to minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're both losing value rapidly - I've already lost over 27% and you've lost over 14%. I'm moving closer to a 52-48 split in your favor. This is my most balanced offer yet, considering our different inflation rates. Let's not let this drag on and lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, with each round, the value of the money decreases significantly more for you than for me. My offer of $6500 for me and $3500 for you reflects this urgency. We need to settle now to prevent further devaluation, especially considering your higher inflation rate.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a completely equal 50-50 split. We've both lost significant value - I've lost 41% and you've lost 23%. Your increasingly aggressive offers are just making us both poorer. This is a perfectly fair split that should end our negotiation immediately. Any further delay is irrational for both of us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, the value of the money is decreasing drastically for both of us, but especially for you at nearly 50% loss now. My offer of $7000 for me and $3000 for you is our best chance to salvage something from this situation. Let's agree now before it gets worse.",Bob,8,
