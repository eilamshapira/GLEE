Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates and the value decrease, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This split takes into account the urgency to settle and the fact that your money depreciates faster. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty for me is higher, but that's exactly why we should settle quickly with a more favorable split for me. Let's move to round 3 where I can make a counter-offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%), any delay hurts me more than you. I'm offering you $4,500 and taking $5,500 - a more balanced split than my first offer. This is fair considering both our positions. Let's avoid further devaluation and agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of the money, especially for you at 10% per round, my offer of $6000 for me and $4000 for you is a compromise that reflects the urgency of the situation. Let's settle now to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The increasing inflation means we should both be more eager to settle, not less. Bob's more aggressive offer doesn't help reach a resolution. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, the value of the money decreases significantly more for you than for me. My offer of $6500 for me and $3500 for you reflects this urgency. We need to settle now to prevent further devaluation, especially considering your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is actually using my higher inflation rate against me, making increasingly unfavorable offers. This isn't constructive negotiation. While we're both losing value, making more extreme offers only prolongs the process. I'll continue with a more reasonable counter-offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a completely equal 50-50 split. We've both lost significant value - I've lost 41% and you've lost 23%. Your increasingly aggressive offers are just making us both poorer. This is a perfectly fair split that should end our negotiation immediately. Any further delay is irrational for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of the money is decreasing drastically for both of us, but especially for you at nearly 50% loss now. My offer of $7000 for me and $3000 for you is our best chance to salvage something from this situation. Let's agree now before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with my 52.17% inflation penalty, $3000 now is worth about $1434. If I reject and we continue, even if I somehow got a better nominal split in future rounds, the real value would likely be even less due to the compounding 10% inflation penalty per round. Bob has successfully used the asymmetric inflation rates to force a less equitable split, but continuing would only make my position worse."
