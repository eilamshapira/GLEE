"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split that acknowledges my first-mover position. You get a substantial $4000 while I take $6000. Remember, delay will cost us both money due to inflation!

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%), any delay hurts me more than you. I'm offering you $4500 and taking $5500 - a more balanced split than my first offer. This is fair considering both our positions. Let's avoid further devaluation and agree now.
