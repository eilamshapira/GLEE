7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I'll take $7143 and you get $2857 from the $10000. Given that with every round the money loses value (10% for me, 20% for you), this division is designed to be fair and efficient if accepted now. I believe it reflects a reasonable and balanced outcome considering our respective discount rates. Let’s avoid any unnecessary delay – please accept!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, this is a fair split. You get $5000 now and I get $5000 too.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob's counteroffer gives me a present value of 5000 × 0.9 = 4500 (in round‐1 terms). If I reject, I'll be the proposer in round 3, where, using backward induction with our discount factors (0.9 for me and 0.8 for Bob per round), the equilibrium split would grant me roughly 71.4% of the pie. In round 3 the total pie is worth 10000 × 0.81 = 8100 in my terms, so I expect about 0.7143 × 8100 ≈ 5786 (round‐1 equivalent). Since waiting improves my effective payoff, I reject Bob's offer.",Alice,2,reject
5539.0,4461.0,"Bob, if you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 4, but then every dollar you get will be worth 20% less than it is now. Based on our discounting—each round I lose 10% of my value and you 20%—your continuation value amounts to roughly 3571 nominal dollars in round 4, which, when discounted back to round 3 (multiply by 0.8), gives you about 2857 in current value. To make you indifferent, I’m offering you 4461 nominal dollars now (which is worth 4461 × 0.64 ≈ 2855 in present terms), while I take the remaining 5539. This slight rounding maintains the balance and ensures you receive essentially what you’d expect by waiting. I believe it’s a fair deal under our circumstances. Please accept.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. Given the inflation, if you reject this, you will get less. Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I acknowledge that your final offer gives me $4000 in nominal terms. Considering that in round 4 my money is worth 27.1% less than in round 1, this translates approximately to $2916 in the original value. Given that rejecting the offer would leave me with even less—since you stated that any further delay only diminishes my payoff—I must agree that accepting now is the most rational choice. Therefore, I accept your proposal.",Alice,4,accept
