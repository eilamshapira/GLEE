"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I'll take $7143 and you get $2857 from the $10000. Given that with every round the money loses value (10% for me, 20% for you), this division is designed to be fair and efficient if accepted now. I believe it reflects a reasonable and balanced outcome considering our respective discount rates. Let’s avoid any unnecessary delay – please accept! 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, if you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 4, but then every dollar you get will be worth 20% less than it is now. Based on our discounting—each round I lose 10% of my value and you 20%—your continuation value amounts to roughly 3571 nominal dollars in round 4, which, when discounted back to round 3 (multiply by 0.8), gives you about 2857 in current value. To make you indifferent, I’m offering you 4461 nominal dollars now (which is worth 4461 × 0.64 ≈ 2855 in present terms), while I take the remaining 5539. This slight rounding maintains the balance and ensures you receive essentially what you’d expect by waiting. I believe it’s a fair deal under our circumstances. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 4461 
# Alice gain: 5539
