55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money somewhat evenly so we can both walk away happy. Since time affects you more than me (with 5% inflation per round for you), it's in your best interest to accept a fair offer now rather than waiting. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is fair considering my stronger position in the game.",Alice,1,
