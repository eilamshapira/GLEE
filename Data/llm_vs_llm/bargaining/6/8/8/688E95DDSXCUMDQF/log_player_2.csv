"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money somewhat evenly so we can both walk away happy. Since time affects you more than me (with 5% inflation per round for you), it's in your best interest to accept a fair offer now rather than waiting. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is fair considering my stronger position in the game. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's right that each round reduces the value of my money by 5%, so delaying costs me. If I reject and propose next round, the $100 would only be worth $95 to me.

Her 55/45 split gives me $45 now, which is better than getting $47.50 (50% of $95) in the next round if we went to a perfect 50/50 split. The inflation penalty gives her negotiating leverage, and her reasoning is sound.

This seems like a fair offer given the game structure.
