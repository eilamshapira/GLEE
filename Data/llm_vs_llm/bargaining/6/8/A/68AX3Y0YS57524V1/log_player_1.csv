"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties' interests. With inflation affecting future rounds, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation, if I accept $400,000 now, it's worth $360,000 in round 1 terms.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less, and Bob might reject again.

Since we have a limited number of rounds and the money keeps losing value for me, it's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal now than risk getting an even worse deal later or nothing at all.
