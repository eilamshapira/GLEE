"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to avoid further inflation risk. Since each round further erodes my share by 5%, I propose an immediate 50-50 split—$50 for you and $50 for me—as a fair and quick resolution. Let’s settle now to avoid any further discounting on my side. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
