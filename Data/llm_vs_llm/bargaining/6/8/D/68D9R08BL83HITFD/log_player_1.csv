"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. This is a multi-round bargaining game with an asymmetric discount factor - the money loses 10% value for me each round but not for Bob. This gives Bob a natural advantage in later rounds.

Given this asymmetry, I should aim for a reasonable first offer that has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly larger portion to myself, but the division is still quite fair. Since Bob doesn't face depreciation, if he rejects this offer, he knows he can potentially get more in future rounds as my bargaining position weakens. However, this initial offer is reasonable enough that accepting it now gives him a substantial amount without risking continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While it's not as favorable as my initial proposal, I need to consider the depreciation factor. If I reject this offer, we move to round 3 where the money will be worth another 10% less to me (20% total depreciation from the original value). 

The $450,000 I'm receiving now is worth more than potentially getting a slightly higher nominal amount in future rounds that would be subject to greater depreciation. Additionally, rejecting could lead to even less favorable terms in later rounds as my bargaining power continues to decrease with each round's inflation penalty."
