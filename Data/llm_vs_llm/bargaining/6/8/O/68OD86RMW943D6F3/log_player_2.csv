"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","While this offer would give me $200,000, it seems quite unbalanced in Alice's favor. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will be $800,000 for the next round. I could propose a more equitable split then.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering the inflation that has already decreased the effective value to $800,000 for me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the million dollars. This is fair and gives both of us substantial value. Since I've already experienced 20% inflation, making the total worth $800,000 to me, this offer would give me $400,000 in effective value while Alice receives $500,000."
