6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. Let's take this deal!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since the money loses value faster for me. Let's end this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Okay Bob, how about this: I get 6500 and you get 3500. I'm already losing value faster than you did in round 1, and this is fair given the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"We're both losing value with each round. Let's split it 55/45.  This will give me a slightly larger share to compensate for my higher inflation rate, while still being fair for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I'm offering 7000 for me and 3000 for you. My inflation is much higher now. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
