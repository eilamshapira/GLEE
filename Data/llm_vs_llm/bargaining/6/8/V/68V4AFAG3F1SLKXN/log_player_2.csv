"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount of $400,000, I should consider that I could potentially negotiate for a better split. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation rate), I don't lose anything by going to another round where I can make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives both of us the same amount, and I believe it respects both our interests equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000. I also notice that she's now experiencing 36% inflation on her portion, which means the $550,000 she's asking for has less value to her than in the first round.

Given that I face no inflation penalty and Alice has improved her offer, I'll accept this division.
