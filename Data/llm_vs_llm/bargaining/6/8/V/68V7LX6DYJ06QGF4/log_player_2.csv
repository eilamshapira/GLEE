"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 40$ for me and 60$ for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a proposal
   * Alice's value of money decreases by 10%
   * My value stays the same
3. This means in the next round, 60$ would only be worth 54$ to Alice
4. I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself

Given this, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, and Alice might be more inclined to accept due to the 10% depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic proposal:

1. Alice's money value has decreased by 10%, so she's more likely to accept a less favorable split
2. But I shouldn't be too aggressive, as she might reject and we still have many rounds
3. A split of 55/45 in my favor might be reasonable - it's better for me than her initial offer, but not so extreme that she's likely to reject it

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it gives me a better deal than the initial offer, while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it considering the 10% depreciation on her end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me 45$ (which is worth full value to me)
2. She takes 55$ (which is actually worth only 44.55$ to her due to 19% depreciation)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * Alice's money will depreciate further (by 29%)
   * I might get a better deal
4. However, this offer is already better than her first offer (40/60)
5. There's risk in continuing to negotiate as we have limited rounds

Given that I'm already getting a better deal than the first round, and the fact that Alice is already experiencing significant depreciation on her end (making this a fairly balanced offer in real terms), I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
