"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is reasonable and has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose that we split the money equally - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $350,000 and keeping $650,000 for himself
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $650,000 is actually worth $520,000 to him (80% of $650,000)
3. My $350,000 hasn't lost any value
4. If I reject, we go to another round, but the inflation effect on Bob's share will increase
5. My initial fair offer was rejected, showing Bob is trying to maximize his gain

While this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount. Given that Bob's value is already diminished by inflation and further delays would reduce his value more, this might be the best practical outcome.
