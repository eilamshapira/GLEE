"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's reasonably fair, giving me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. If Bob rejects and we move to the next round, my potential gain would be worth 20% less, so there's incentive to reach an agreement now
3. Bob might recognize that a relatively fair first offer is better than going through multiple rounds of negotiation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000
2. Due to 20% inflation for me, this $450,000 is actually worth $360,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% less)
4. The difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer isn't huge
5. The inflation rate affects me much more severely than Bob (20% vs 5%)
6. Prolonging the negotiation will hurt me more than Bob

Given these factors, especially the harsh inflation penalty I face, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
