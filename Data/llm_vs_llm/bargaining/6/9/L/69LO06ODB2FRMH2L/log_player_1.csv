Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 2, the value of money decreases due to inflation. Therefore, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to compensate for the loss in value for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
