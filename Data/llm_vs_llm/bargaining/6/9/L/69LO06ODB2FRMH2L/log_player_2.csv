"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is impacting you, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. Let's compromise at 55/45. This still gives you more than an even split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
