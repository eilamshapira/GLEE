450000.0,550000.0,"I now understand we face different inflation rates, with yours being significantly higher. This means delays cost you more than they cost me. My offer gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than a larger amount several rounds later given your 36% inflation rate already. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric situation.",Bob,4,
