"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider the impact of inflation on future rounds. While her offer gives me less than half of the total, I should factor in that waiting will reduce the value of my share by 5% per round.

Let me analyze this:
- Current offer: $400,000 for me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I face 5% inflation
- My counter-offer would need to be accepted, or we risk further rounds and more inflation
- After 12 rounds of rejection, we both get nothing

Alice's initial offer isn't 50-50, but considering the inflation penalty I face, it's not unreasonable. However, I believe I can make a counter-offer that might be more advantageous.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm under.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid losing value to inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly in my favor, considering my loss to inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting - now I have additional information that Alice experiences much higher inflation than I do (36% vs my 9.75% after two rounds). This significantly changes the dynamics, as delaying is more costly for Alice than for me.

Given this new information:
- Alice's offer gives me $420,000, which is better than her first offer
- Alice is facing severe inflation pressure (36% already)
- My inflation is much more modest at 9.75%
- I now have leverage since delaying hurts Alice more than me

Since Alice is under greater time pressure due to her higher inflation rate, I can likely negotiate for a better deal in the next round. The fact that she's increased her offer already suggests she's feeling the pressure of her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll leverage the information about our different inflation rates to propose a split that acknowledges both our positions.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I now understand we face different inflation rates, with yours being significantly higher. This means delays cost you more than they cost me. My offer gives you $450,000 now, which is worth more than a larger amount several rounds later given your 36% inflation rate already. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric situation.""}"
