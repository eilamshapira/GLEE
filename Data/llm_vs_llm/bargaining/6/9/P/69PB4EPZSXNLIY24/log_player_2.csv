"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. This benefits both of us, and we avoid losing value over time.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This split accounts for the lost value and is still a win for both of us. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, and getting closer to a point where I need to accept. However, I'm banking on Alice's desire to get a deal done and avoid getting $0.  The inflation disparity is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is getting tight, let's be practical and split this evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing value fast! I'll take a slightly smaller cut this time. This is a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as good as it's going to get, I suspect.  Alice is unlikely to go lower, and the longer this drags on the worse it is for me.  Taking the slightly smaller cut now makes more sense than risking a total loss."
