"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split considering the risk of you declining and potentially getting less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, while keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting now versus rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round.

If I reject, I'll get to make my own proposal next round, but Alice could then reject my offer too, potentially leading to further rounds of negotiation. There's some strategic advantage in accepting a reasonable offer now rather than risking a prolonged game.

However, I believe I can propose a more equitable distribution in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the negotiation dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both benefit equally, and there's no reason for either of us to feel we've been treated unfairly.""}"
