60.0,40.0,Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation risk, but 60-40 is a bit too skewed in your favor. How about a 55-45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,How about we meet in the middle? 58-42 split. Inflation is affecting both of us more each round.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, it seems we both want a decent share. Let's stop wasting time with this back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,4,
