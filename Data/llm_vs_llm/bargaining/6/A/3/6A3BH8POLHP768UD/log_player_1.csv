Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is the same as mine in the previous round, and considering the inflation, the actual value I would get is 10% less, which is 540000.
