"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that I'm affected by inflation and Bob isn't. I want to start with a reasonable proposal that has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

The deal is reasonable because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split
2. I'm asking for slightly more because I'm affected by inflation in future rounds
3. It leaves Bob with a substantial amount that's not too far from half"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because it's too unfavorable for me. Not only would I get significantly less than half (4000 vs 6000), but due to the 5% inflation, my 4000 is actually worth only 3800. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob rejected a fairly reasonable first offer and then made a quite aggressive counter-offer, I'll adjust my strategy but still try to keep it reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm increasing my requested share slightly because:
1. The money is now worth 10% less to me due to inflation (two rounds of 5%)
2. Bob has shown aggressive negotiating behavior
3. Even with this split, due to inflation, my actual value received would be around 5220 (5800 * 0.9), which is still quite fair"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because:
1. With 14.26% inflation, my $3500 would actually be worth only about $3000
2. The split is very unfavorable (35-65)
3. We still have several rounds left, and even with increasing inflation, I can likely negotiate a better deal
4. Bob's offers are getting more aggressive (from 4000/6000 to 3500/6500), suggesting manipulative behavior

I'll continue negotiating for a fairer split, though I'll need to be mindful of the increasing inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the escalating situation and increasing inflation (now at about 19% for the next round), I need to be strategic while still leaving room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm adjusting my offer because:
1. With current inflation at around 19%, my $6000 would actually be worth about $4860
2. Bob has shown a pattern of very aggressive offers (65-35 split in his favor)
3. I need to counter his aggressive stance while still leaving room for negotiation
4. This offer would still give Bob a significant amount
5. We need to reach an agreement soon as inflation is eating away at my value each round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this increasingly unfair offer because:
1. With 22.62% inflation, my $3000 would actually only be worth about $2321
2. Bob's offers keep getting worse (from 4000 → 3500 → 3000)
3. The 30-70 split is extremely unfair
4. While inflation is becoming a serious concern, this offer is still too low to accept

However, I need to be very careful now as:
1. We're halfway through our rounds
2. Inflation is significantly eroding my potential gains
3. We need to reach an agreement before both getting nothing

I'll make a more compromising offer in the next round if given the chance."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the mounting inflation pressure and the need to reach an agreement before we both get nothing, I'll make a more compromising offer while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}

This offer is more moderate because:
1. With current inflation at about 27%, my $5700 would actually be worth about $4161
2. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer of 6000/4000
3. It's still fair enough to be defensible while showing willingness to compromise
4. We're entering the latter half of negotiations, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing
5. I'm hoping Bob recognizes this as a genuine move toward compromise

If Bob rejects this, I may need to make even larger concessions in future rounds due to the compounding inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because:
1. With 30.17% inflation, my $2500 would only be worth about $1746
2. Bob's offers continue to get worse (4000 → 3500 → 3000 → 2500)
3. A 25-75 split is extremely unfair
4. Even considering the time pressure and inflation, this deal is too poor

However, this is getting very risky because:
1. Only 4 rounds remain
2. Inflation will be over 35% next round
3. The risk of both getting nothing is becoming very real

In the next round, I'll need to make a significantly more compromising offer to try to break this deadlock, as getting nothing would be worse than a suboptimal deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the critical situation with only 4 rounds left and inflation now around 35%, I need to make a significantly more compromising offer to avoid both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This offer is much more conciliatory because:
1. With current inflation at about 35%, my $5200 would actually be worth about $3380
2. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers
3. The nominal split is nearly 50-50, which appeals to fairness
4. We absolutely need to reach an agreement soon
5. Even though Bob has been aggressive, I'm showing good faith to break the deadlock

I'm hoping Bob sees this as a serious attempt to reach agreement, as we're running out of time and the risk of mutual failure is becoming very real."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer, despite the extremely high pressure, because:
1. With 36.98% inflation, my $2000 would only be worth about $1260
2. Bob's offers keep getting worse (4000→3500→3000→2500→2000)
3. An 80-20 split is extremely exploitative
4. Even with only 2 rounds remaining after this, this deal is unacceptably low

However, this is now an extremely risky situation:
1. Only 2 rounds remain
2. Inflation will be over 40% in the next round
3. We're very close to both getting nothing

In the next round, I'll make an even more dramatic concession, as getting nothing is now a very real possibility. But accepting just $1260 in real value is still worse than risking one more round of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only 2 rounds left and inflation at about 42%, this is a critical moment that requires a dramatic concession to avoid both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This is my most conciliatory offer because:
1. With current inflation at about 42%, my $4500 would be worth about $2610
2. This is a major reduction from all my previous offers
3. I'm now offering Bob the majority share (55%)
4. If we don't reach agreement now, we have only one round left
5. The risk of both getting zero is extremely high

I'm hoping Bob recognizes this as a serious final attempt to reach agreement. Even though Bob has been aggressive throughout, getting nothing would be worse for both of us than reaching a deal now. This offer gives Bob a clear win while still leaving me with something meaningful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer, despite it being extremely unfair, because:
1. This is the final round - if I reject, we both get nothing
2. With 43.12% inflation, my $1000 will be worth about $569
3. While this is a very poor outcome for me (90-10 split), getting $569 is still better than getting $0
4. Bob has played very aggressively throughout, but I have no more leverage

Bob has successfully used the inflation pressure and the threat of mutual failure to extract a very favorable deal. While I'm disappointed with the outcome, accepting this offer is the rational choice given the alternative of getting nothing."
