"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while slightly favoring me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Since there's 10% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's $50 offer now, it's actually worth $45 to me (50 * 0.9). Bob would get his full $50.

While this is less favorable than my initial offer, rejecting would mean facing another 10% inflation in the next round, making future gains worth even less to me. There's also no guarantee that future offers would be better.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50-50 split offer."
