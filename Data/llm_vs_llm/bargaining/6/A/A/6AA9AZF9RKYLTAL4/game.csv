3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob. To avoid any further loss in value due to inflation, I propose that I receive $3448 and you get $6552. Accepting now secures you the full value, whereas waiting would cost both of us money. I believe this is a fair and efficient split – let’s settle now!",Alice,1,

3200.0,6800.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the potential future loss on my end. This offer is still quite generous, and I think we should settle now to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,

8651.0,1349.0,"Hi Bob, I know we’re both feeling the pinch as each round’s inflation eats away at our dollar’s value. To avoid even steeper losses, I’m offering a division where you receive $1349 and I take $8651. This is set so that—in today’s round—your effective payoff (0.9 × $1349 ≈ $1214) matches what you’d expect to get if you delayed and took control next round (after further discounting). I believe this offer gives you exactly your reservation value in round 3, and it spares us both extra value loss. Let’s settle now before inflation bites us any further!",Alice,3,

2700.0,7300.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we're both losing value with each round, but your last offer was far too skewed in your favor. Given the current situation, I'm willing to take a larger share to offset the potential future losses. This offer is still reasonable, considering the inflation rates, and I think we should settle now to prevent further devaluation.",Bob,4,

3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob, I’ve worked through the numbers and, given our respective discount rates (0.9 for me and 0.95 for you per round), I believe this split is exactly what we’d both end up with if we continued bargaining. In other words, by accepting this offer now, you secure the same present value that you’d otherwise expect by waiting—without incurring additional inflation losses. Let’s settle now and preserve as much of our combined value as possible.",Alice,5,
