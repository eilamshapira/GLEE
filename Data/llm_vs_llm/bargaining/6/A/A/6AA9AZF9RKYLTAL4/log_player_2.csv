"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. To avoid any further loss in value due to inflation, I propose that I receive $3448 and you get $6552. Accepting now secures you the full value, whereas waiting would cost both of us money. I believe this is a fair and efficient split – let’s settle now! 
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, 
""alice_gain"": 3200, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the potential future loss on my end. This offer is still quite generous, and I think we should settle now to minimize our losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know we’re both feeling the pinch as each round’s inflation eats away at our dollar’s value. To avoid even steeper losses, I’m offering a division where you receive $1349 and I take $8651. This is set so that—in today’s round—your effective payoff (0.9 × $1349 ≈ $1214) matches what you’d expect to get if you delayed and took control next round (after further discounting). I believe this offer gives you exactly your reservation value in round 3, and it spares us both extra value loss. Let’s settle now before inflation bites us any further! 
# Bob gain: 1349 
# Alice gain: 8651 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7300, 
""alice_gain"": 2700, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we're both losing value with each round, but your last offer was far too skewed in your favor. Given the current situation, I'm willing to take a larger share to offset the potential future losses. This offer is still reasonable, considering the inflation rates, and I think we should settle now to prevent further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’ve worked through the numbers and, given our respective discount rates (0.9 for me and 0.95 for you per round), I believe this split is exactly what we’d both end up with if we continued bargaining. In other words, by accepting this offer now, you secure the same present value that you’d otherwise expect by waiting—without incurring additional inflation losses. Let’s settle now and preserve as much of our combined value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448
