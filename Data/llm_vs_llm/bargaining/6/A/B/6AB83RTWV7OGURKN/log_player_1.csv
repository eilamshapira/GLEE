"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll make my offer, keeping the inflation in mind. Since it's the first round, and I'm affected by inflation, I need to ensure I get a larger share to offset the potential future losses. I will propose:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My money is worth 10% less now. Bob's offer is $4500 for me and $5500 for him. I need to consider if rejecting this and making a counteroffer next round is worthwhile, given the increasing inflation.

Let's calculate the real value of Bob's offer to me: $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

If I reject, next round, my money will be worth 20% less. I need to decide if I can secure significantly more than $4500 next round to make up for that. It's risky.

I'll accept this offer.
