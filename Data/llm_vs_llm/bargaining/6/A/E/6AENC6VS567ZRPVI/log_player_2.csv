"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split 60/40 in this first round. It keeps things fair for both of us, considering inflation could affect our decisions later on. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. 

If I reject and move to round 2, the total value decreases by 10% for me due to inflation. This means the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. 

While a 50/50 split would give me $450,000, that would be after losing 10% value, so approximately $405,000. That's only slightly better than the current offer of $400,000, and requires Alice to agree to those terms.

Given that:
1. The difference between what I might get in the next round vs. now is minimal
2. There's uncertainty about Alice's acceptance of my counter-offer
3. There's a risk of continued rounds decreasing the money's value further
