"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
    ""alice_gain"": 600000,
    ""bob_gain"": 400000,
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a very substantial gain.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a more equitable 48-52 split would be fairer to both of us. You still get the larger share, but it better reflects our equal starting positions. Let's avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $520,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $416,000
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any future gains will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
* Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable, giving me the larger share
* Further negotiation rounds will only decrease the real value of my gains more significantly
