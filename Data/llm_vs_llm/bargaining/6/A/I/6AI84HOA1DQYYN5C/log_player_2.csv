"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a very substantial gain. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * Maximum I could theoretically get would be $950,000 (after 5% inflation)
   * But Alice would likely reject an extremely uneven split
3. $400,000 is a substantial amount
4. However, a 60-40 split in the first round seems a bit unfair when we're starting with equal bargaining power

Given that I can make a counter-offer and the inflation isn't too punishing for just one round, I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a more equitable 48-52 split would be fairer to both of us. You still get the larger share, but it better reflects our equal starting positions. Let's avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}"
