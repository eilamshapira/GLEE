Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a very fair offer for you, Bob.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split the money equally. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit.   
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair split, and accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate while the money loses value. With the 20% inflation penalty already applied in this round, accepting $5000 now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
