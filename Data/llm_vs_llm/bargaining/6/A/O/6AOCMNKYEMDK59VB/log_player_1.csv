"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation penalty for me in later rounds. I'll try to be fair but also account for the risk of future devaluation.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Explanation:

I'm asking for $5500, leaving $4500 for Bob. This gives me a slightly larger share to compensate for the risk of the money losing value in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer. I believe it's a reasonable starting point that Bob might find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has proposed a split where I get $4500 and he gets $5500. I need to consider the inflation. My $4500 now is worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1.

Let's calculate: $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 (in round 1 dollars).

While this is lower than my initial offer, rejecting means further devaluation if we continue. It also means the potential for a complete loss if we reach round 13.

Let's compare this with the potential outcomes if I reject. It's highly likely that Bob will propose an even lower amount for me in round 3. The value decreases more each round, and I'm at risk of getting nothing.

Given these considerations, I will accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
