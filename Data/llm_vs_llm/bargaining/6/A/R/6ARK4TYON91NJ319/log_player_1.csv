"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a fair proposal that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you 45% of the money, which is a fair split considering I face 5% inflation per round. This way we can resolve this quickly and both walk away with a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
