"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. This gives us both $5000. Since there's no inflation pressure on my end, I can continue negotiating if needed, but I believe this even split respects both of our interests equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
