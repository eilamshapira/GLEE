"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm proposing 5500 for me and 4500 for you. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000 total.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me leverage in future rounds.

The current offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't quite an even split. Since I can make a counter-offer next round without penalty, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. This gives us both $5,000. Since there's no inflation pressure on my end, I can continue negotiating if needed, but I believe this even split respects both of our interests equally.""}"
