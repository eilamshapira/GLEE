"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting the total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the impact of inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money and the need to reach an agreement swiftly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation
- Actual value for me: $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth 40% less for me
- Even if I got a better split, it would be significantly devalued

Given that the devaluation is accelerating and Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's better to accept now rather than risk further losses.
