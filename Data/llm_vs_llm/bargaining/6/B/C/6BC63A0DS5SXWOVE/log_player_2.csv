"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""This offer makes up for the money lost to inflation in later rounds. It's best for both of us to agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than my previous offer after accounting for inflation. It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk further losses from inflation."
