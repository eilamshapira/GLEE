5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it fairly! I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a good starting point and avoids unnecessary delays due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"My turn! Considering the inflation, I'm making a reasonable offer. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Okay, round 3. My offer is $6200 for me and $3800 for you. Inflation is eating away at the value of this money. Let's make a deal now before it's all gone!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Inflation is indeed a concern, but I'm not willing to settle for less. Let's make a deal that favors me slightly, considering the diminishing value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, we are losing money fast to inflation. My offer is $6800 for me and $3200 for you. I know it seems like I'm asking for more, but the real value of this money is decreasing rapidly. We need to agree before we both get much less!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. This is my final reasonable offer before I consider waiting for a better deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7300.0,2700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is $7300 for me and $2700 for you. Look, I know this seems like a big ask, but the inflation is killing us! With each passing round, we get less and less. Please, let's just agree. The time is against us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"I'm taking a big risk by waiting, but I believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is hurting me more than you, so I'm willing to push my luck. Meet me in the middle, or we'll both lose out.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7800.0,2200.0,"Bob, seriously, this has gone too far. Inflation is devastating us. My offer is $7800 for me and $2200 for you. I'm offering you something despite the fact that the money is practically worthless at this point if we don't take a deal. Please, accept this.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I know it's a long shot, but I'm desperate to get a decent share. The inflation is crippling, and I'm willing to take a huge risk. If you don't accept, we might both end up with nothing.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8200.0,1800.0,"Bob, this is the end of the line. My offer is $8200 for me and $1800 for you. I understand this is a bad deal for you, but we've let inflation decimate the money. This is the best I can offer, and we have one round left. Please, take it.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,accept
