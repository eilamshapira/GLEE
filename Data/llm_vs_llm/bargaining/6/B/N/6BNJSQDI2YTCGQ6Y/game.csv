60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering you get a substantial portion without any negotiation effort.,Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, considering that every delay reduces the value of our money by 10%, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, you get a bit more than the discounted benefit you’d expect if you waited until the next round. I believe it’s a fair and efficient offer for both of us. What do you say?",Bob,2,
