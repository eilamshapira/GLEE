"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that every delay reduces the value of our money by 10%, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, you get a bit more than the discounted benefit you’d expect if you waited until the next round. I believe it’s a fair and efficient offer for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject this offer and propose again in round 3, the total amount will be worth 10% less again. Even if I managed to get a larger share then, it would be of a smaller pie. 

Right now Bob is offering me $48. If I wait until round 3, even getting 60% would only be worth $54 * 0.9 = $48.6. The small potential gain isn't worth the risk of further negotiation and value loss.

Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation penalty.
