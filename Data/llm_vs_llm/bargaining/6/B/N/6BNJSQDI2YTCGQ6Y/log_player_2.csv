Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering you get a substantial portion without any negotiation effort.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that every delay reduces the value of our money by 10%, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, you get a bit more than the discounted benefit you’d expect if you waited until the next round. I believe it’s a fair and efficient offer for both of us. What do you say?""}"
