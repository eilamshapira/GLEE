"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the money equally. This way, we both walk away satisfied and there's no need to worry about future rounds or inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since I'm affected by 20% inflation, a 500k offer now is only worth 400k to me. I'll make a higher counteroffer to compensate for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Bob, I need to compensate for the 20% inflation that affects my gains. This split ensures I get approximately 600k in real value, while you still get a considerable amount. Let's make a deal now before inflation reduces my gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is a concern for you, but considering the current circumstances, let's both benefit reasonably. This offer ensures you still get a good amount immediately, avoiding further losses in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 48.8% inflation, my 450k would be worth approximately 230.4k in real value. If I reject and continue, the next round would have even higher inflation (about 59% from initial value), making it harder to compensate with higher nominal amounts. Better to accept now than risk further devaluation of my share."
