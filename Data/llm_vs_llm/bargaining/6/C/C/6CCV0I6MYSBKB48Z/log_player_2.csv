"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but it's not terribly unfair either. However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. The money will be worth 20% less (so $8,000 total), but I could potentially get a better share.

Let me consider: If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd offer Alice $4,000 and keep $4,000. This is less than her current offer of $5,500, so she might reject. We'd then lose another 20% value, and the cycle might continue.

I'll reject this first offer so I can propose what I consider more fair in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more balanced offer that still gives Alice an incentive to accept rather than going to another round where the total value decreases.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $5,000, which is a fair division. For Alice, this is only $500 less than her initial offer, but gives us perfect equality. If she rejects, we'll move to round 3 where the total money decreases to $8,000 (20% less), meaning even an ideal split would give her less than what I'm offering now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has rejected my 50-50 split and is now offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. This is a less favorable offer for me than her initial one, even accounting for inflation.

Let me analyze the situation: The money is now worth 36% less than in round 1, meaning the total $10,000 pot is effectively worth $6,400. Her offer gives me $4,000 of that $6,400, which is actually 62.5% of the remaining value. 

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where the money loses another 20% value. If the pattern continues, we might keep losing value without reaching agreement.

This offer, while not ideal, gives me a substantial portion of the remaining value, and continuing to reject offers risks further devaluation. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
