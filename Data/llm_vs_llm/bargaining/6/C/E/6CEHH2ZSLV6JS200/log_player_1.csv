"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't. Since I have a stronger position, I can propose a split slightly in my favor, but not too extreme to avoid rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth less due to the 5% inflation on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. For me, $50 is worth $50
3. For Bob, his $50 is actually worth $47.50 (5% less)
4. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less

While I could reject and try to get a better deal in the next round, a 50-50 split is quite fair and there's risk in continuing. Bob has already shown they'll reject a 60-40 split, so getting a much better deal might be difficult.
