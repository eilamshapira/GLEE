"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a slightly favorable but reasonable first offer to Bob. While I could try to demand more, being too aggressive might lead to rejection and value loss due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. It's a 55-45 split that gives me a moderate advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the 5% inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The total amount is now effectively worth $950,000 due to 5% inflation
2. Bob is offering me $475,000
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth only $902,500
4. I could propose again, but Bob might reject, leading to further losses
5. The current offer is close to a 50-50 split (slightly in Bob's favor)
6. Getting $475,000 now is better than risking further inflation
