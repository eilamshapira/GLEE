"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference to avoid further losses from inflation. 55/45 sounds fair. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept now, I get $55, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $49.50.
If I reject and make a new offer next round, even if I get a higher amount, it will be worth 20% less due to inflation.

Since $49.50 is still a decent amount and better than risking further depreciation, I should accept.
