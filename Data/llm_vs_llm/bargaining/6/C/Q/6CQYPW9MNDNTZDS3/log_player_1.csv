"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob while considering the inflation rates that affect us both. Since I'm affected by a higher inflation rate (10% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, it's in my interest to settle sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor, as I face a higher inflation rate. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I need to secure a slightly better deal to offset my higher inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider our inflation rates carefully. With each round, my money loses 10% value while Bob's loses 5%. We're now in round 3, so I should find a balance that makes a deal attractive now.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split of 51-49 in my favor. This is more favorable to Bob than my initial offer while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. Let's reach an agreement now rather than letting inflation further reduce the value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is slowly adjusting his offers, but we're still not reaching an agreement. As we're now in round 5, both of us are losing significant value due to inflation - my money is worth over 30% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth about 20% less.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair to both of us and represents a compromise from my previous positions. Given the accelerating impact of inflation, reaching an agreement now is becoming increasingly important for both of us."
