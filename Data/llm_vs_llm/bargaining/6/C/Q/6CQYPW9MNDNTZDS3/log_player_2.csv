"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
3. I'll be able to make a counter-offer next round
4. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
5. The split isn't too unfair, but I could potentially get a better deal

Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I have some leverage. I could make a counter-offer next round when the money is worth less to her. However, there's also risk in waiting too long.

I'll reject this offer as I think I can get a better deal, and the devaluation difference works in my favor.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. Let me strategize:

1. The money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
2. Alice needs to accept this offer, or we'll go to another round with further devaluation
3. I should offer something that's fair enough for Alice to accept, but better for me than her first offer
4. Given the higher devaluation rate for Alice, she has more incentive to accept sooner

I'll propose a slightly better split for myself while still keeping it reasonable enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000}

This gives me 52.5% and Alice 47.5%, which is a reasonable improvement from the previous offer while still being fair enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $490,000 (49%) and keeping $510,000 (51%)
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $490,000 is actually worth $442,225 (490,000 * 0.9025)
   - Alice's $510,000 is worth $413,100 (510,000 * 0.81)
3. This is better than her first offer (45/55 split)
4. If I reject:
   - Next round will have another 5% devaluation for me
   - Another 10% devaluation for Alice
   - But I get to make the next offer

The offer is getting more balanced, and the actual value after inflation is becoming significant. Since Alice's money is devaluing faster, she's showing more willingness to compromise. However, I think there's still room for a better deal, and I have the advantage of making the next offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me strategize for this round:

1. The money is now worth 14.75% less to me and 29% less to Alice than in round 1
2. Alice has shown willingness to improve offers (from 45/55 to 49/51)
3. The rapid devaluation for Alice (29%) means she has strong incentive to agree soon
4. I should make an offer that's attractive enough to end the game, as continued devaluation hurts us both

Given these factors, I'll propose a split slightly in my favor that should be attractive enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 540000, 
""alice_gain"": 460000}

This 54/46 split is:
- Better than Alice's last offer
- Not so greedy that it would certainly be rejected
- Accounts for Alice's higher devaluation rate
- Would give Alice $326,600 in real value (460,000 * 0.71) if she rejects and waits another round
- Reasonable enough that Alice might accept to stop further value loss"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this 50/50 split offer:

1. Real values after inflation:
   - My $500,000 is worth $407,250 (500,000 * 0.8145)
   - Alice's $500,000 is worth $328,050 (500,000 * 0.6561)

2. Considerations:
   - This is a perfectly even split nominally
   - Alice has moved from 45/55 to 50/50, showing significant compromise
   - We're 5 rounds in out of 12, and values are decreasing substantially
   - Next round would mean another 5% loss for me and 10% for Alice
   - Fair offers are becoming more urgent as value erodes

Given that:
- This is a fair nominal split
- Further negotiation will significantly reduce value for both of us
- We've reached a natural compromise point
- The difference in our devaluation rates means Alice is offering this despite taking a bigger real loss
