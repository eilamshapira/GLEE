"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $30 while she gets $70.

Considering that:
1. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counteroffer
2. In the next round, the total value decreases by 5% (to $95)
3. I'd have the opportunity to propose a more favorable split for myself
4. However, Alice could then reject my offer, leading to further depreciation

While $30 isn't an equal split, getting $30 now is better than potentially less in future rounds if negotiations break down.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I suggest we go with a more equitable distribution where I receive $45 and you receive $55. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests while avoiding further depreciation of the total amount."
