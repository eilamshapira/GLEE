"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money is worth 20% less to me (I'll only get 80% value)
   * Next round money is worth 10% less to Alice
   * I get to make the next proposal
   * Maximum I could propose would be worth less due to inflation

3. If I accept:
   * I get $4000 now at full value
   * This is 40% of the total, which isn't great but isn't terrible

Given that I lose value faster than Alice (20% vs 10% per round), and that I'd need to propose something very compelling to make up for the lost value in the next round, I think it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk losing value through negotiation.
