"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. I am willing to negotiate, but this initial offer heavily favors Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This seems more balanced considering the depreciation. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation with inflation. This offer is my final one. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point.  Alice's offer is her ""final offer,"" and further rejection will likely lead to an even worse outcome for me as the value of her gains continues to decrease."
