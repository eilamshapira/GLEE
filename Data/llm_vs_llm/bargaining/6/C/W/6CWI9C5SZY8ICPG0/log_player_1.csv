Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the impact of inflation on me, I need a bit more to make it balanced. This offer takes into account the asymmetrical inflation rates affecting us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
