Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I also need to consider my own situation. My new offer of 475000 for me and 525000 for you is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation impact on both of us, yet still aims for a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000
