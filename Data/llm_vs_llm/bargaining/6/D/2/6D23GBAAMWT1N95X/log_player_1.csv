"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still fair, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

- Original amount for me: $4800
- Original amount for Bob: $5200

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob due to inflation:

- My value: $4800 * 0.95 = $4560
- Bob's value: $5200 * 0.9 = $4680

Considering this, Bob's offer gives him a slightly higher value than me, but not significantly so. Given that the difference isn't drastic and that with each round, the value decreases further, it might be beneficial to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.
