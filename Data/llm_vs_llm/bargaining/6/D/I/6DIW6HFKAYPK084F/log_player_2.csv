"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the loss in value from further delays on my side, I propose we settle now. I’m offering you $60 and keeping $40 for myself. I hope you’ll agree that it’s best to conclude our negotiations immediately. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","This actually seems like a fair offer from Alice. She's suggesting I get $60 (the larger share) while she takes $40. Given that I face a 10% inflation penalty for each round I delay, accepting now would secure me a good portion of the total amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and my potential gain would decrease by 10% in the next round.
