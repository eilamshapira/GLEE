"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is 0.95 * $450,000 = $427,500.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. For me, it's a 5% decrease again, and for Bob, it's a 20% decrease.

Given these circumstances, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor, but considering the inflation, it might be better to accept it rather than risking a lower value in the next round.
