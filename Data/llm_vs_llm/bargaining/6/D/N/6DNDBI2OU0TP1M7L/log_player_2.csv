"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
* The current offer gives me $4,000
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 5% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
* If I get $5,000 next round, it would actually be worth $4,750 to me
* The current $4,000 offer is a decent amount (40% of total)
* Rejecting could lead to back-and-forth that erodes value due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice to lock in guaranteed value.
