"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is opening with an offer where she would get 70% of the money and I would get 30%, I should consider the future rounds and the differing inflation rates. Since my inflation rate (5%) is much lower than Alice's (20%), I have an advantage by waiting. In future rounds, I can propose a better split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given our different inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Alice), I have an advantage in later rounds. The money is now worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice compared to round 1. I'll offer a more balanced split that acknowledges this dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. Since the money devalues much faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), this split benefits both of us by reaching an agreement quickly before further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1, but it's still quite favorable to her. I need to consider the inflation rates and remaining rounds carefully.

For me, money has devalued by 9.75%, while for Alice, it has devalued by 36%. This means Alice is under much more pressure to reach an agreement soon. If we continue to the next round, Alice's money will devalue even more drastically.

Given that I have a significant advantage due to the inflation rate difference, and we still have 9 rounds remaining, I can afford to wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation pressure continues to build, especially for Alice. At this point, money has devalued by about 14.3% for me and 48.8% for Alice compared to round 1. I'll make an offer that recognizes this growing disparity while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, which is substantially more valuable than waiting further rounds given your 20% per round inflation rate. As the game progresses, each round costs you significantly more value than it costs me. This is a fair offer that acknowledges our different positions and allows us both to walk away with significant value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again, now offering me 40% of the total. However, I need to carefully consider our positions:

1) For me, money has devalued by 18.55%, meaning $400,000 now is worth about $326,000 in round 1 terms.

2) For Alice, money has devalued by 59.04%, meaning her $600,000 is worth only about $246,000 in round 1 terms.

3) We're now in round 5 of 12, so there are still 7 rounds remaining.

4) Alice's inflation rate (20% per round) is much higher than mine (5% per round), putting her under significantly more pressure.

Given these factors, I believe I can still get a better deal in later rounds as Alice's position weakens further due to the dramatic inflation difference.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point, inflation has significantly impacted both of us, but much more severely for Alice. Money has devalued by approximately 23% for me and 67% for Alice compared to round 1. With only 6 rounds remaining after this one, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality while being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

Alice, I'm offering you $350,000. Given your 20% per round inflation rate, this amount now is worth significantly more than what you might get in future rounds. We're halfway through our negotiation period, and waiting further will dramatically decrease the value for both of us, but especially for you. This offer recognizes our different inflation pressures and provides a fair solution that prevents further value loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to 45% for me and 55% for her. Let me analyze this situation:

1) Money has devalued by 26.49% for me, making $450,000 now worth about $331,000 in round 1 terms.

2) For Alice, money has devalued by 73.79%, making her $550,000 worth only about $144,000 in round 1 terms.

3) We've now completed 7 rounds, with only 5 rounds remaining before we both get nothing.

4) Alice's much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%) continues to put her in an increasingly disadvantaged position.

Given that Alice's money is losing value so rapidly and we're moving closer to the final round, I could potentially get an even better deal by waiting. However, the risk of running out of rounds is also increasing.

After careful consideration:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 8 of 12, with only 4 rounds remaining after this one. The inflation impact continues to grow - my money has devalued by about 30% and Alice's by about 80% compared to round 1. Given the limited remaining rounds and the severe inflation pressure on Alice, I'll make an offer that strongly favors me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

Alice, I'm offering you $300,000. With your 20% per round inflation rate, your money has already lost about 80% of its original value. If we continue for even two more rounds, your potential gain will be worth very little. This offer gives you a substantial amount that still retains some value, while acknowledging the significant advantage my lower inflation rate gives me. We have only 4 rounds remaining before we both get nothing, so accepting now is in both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to a 50-50 split. Let me analyze this carefully:

1) Money has devalued by 33.66% for me, making $500,000 now worth about $331,700 in round 1 terms.

2) For Alice, money has devalued by 83.22%, making her $500,000 worth only about $84,000 in round 1 terms.

3) We've now completed 9 rounds, with only 3 rounds remaining before we both get nothing.

4) The risk of running out of rounds and both getting nothing is becoming significant.

Given that Alice's money is now worth less than 17% of its original value, while mine still retains over 66% of its value, the 50-50 split heavily favors me in real terms. Additionally, with only 3 rounds left, the risk of ending with nothing is substantial.

This is actually a reasonable offer considering our current situation and the time pressure:
