"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous offer for myself, but I want to ensure it's reasonable enough that Bob will accept it. A 51/49 split gives Bob a significant portion and avoids being too greedy in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, a 50/50 split is fair. I accept the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
