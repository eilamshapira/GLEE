"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This gives Bob a substantial share while recognizing my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't accept this offer, as I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a more balanced split where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair compromise between our previous positions and closer to an even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. The split is reasonably fair and close to 50-50, and continuing to negotiate for a few more dollars isn't worth the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
