Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 610000 
# Bob gain: 390000

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount, rather than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree."
