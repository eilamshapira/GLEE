Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split. While this gives you less than your initial offer, it's still a substantial amount worth $3800 after your 5% inflation. If we continue to the next round, both of us will lose more value. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
