"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering you a good chunk to make sure we both benefit. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $1,000 out of $10,000 (10%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * But I get to make the next offer

$1,000 is quite a low offer, considering the total amount is $10,000. Even with the inflation penalty, I would be better off making a counter-offer in the next round where I could propose a more equitable split. With the inflation rates, I can still offer Alice a reasonable amount while getting more for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 80% of original value
- For Alice: 95% of original value

I should propose a split that gives me a better share while still being attractive to Alice, considering she faces less inflation pressure than I do.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. While this gives you less than your initial offer, it's still a substantial amount worth $3,800 after your 5% inflation. If we continue to the next round, both of us will lose more value. Let's make a deal now.""}"
