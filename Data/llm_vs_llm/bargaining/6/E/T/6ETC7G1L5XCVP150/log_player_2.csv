Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it a bit more even, but I'll take a bit more since I'm going second.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $50 would be worth approximately $32 (100 - 36% = 64, and 50 * 0.64 = 32). 
However, since Alice's gain is only worth 9.75% less, her $50 would be worth approximately $45.25 (100 - 9.75% = 90.25, and 50 * 0.9025 = 45.25). 
Given the significant difference in value due to inflation, I should try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money is worth 36% less for me, and it will continue to decrease. I should try to get a better deal for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need a better split than 30/70. Let's aim for a 45/55 split to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $55 would be worth approximately $22.58 (100 - 59.04% = 40.96, and 55 * 0.4096 = 22.58). 
However, since Alice's gain is only worth 18.55% less, her $45 would be worth approximately $36.68 (100 - 18.55% = 81.45, and 45 * 0.8145 = 36.68). 
Given the significant difference in value due to inflation, I should consider accepting this offer, as it might be the best I can get.
