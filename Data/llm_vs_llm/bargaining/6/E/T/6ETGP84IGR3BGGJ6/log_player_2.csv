"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. While not an equal split, it's a substantial amount
3. She's right about inflation - if I reject, next round the total value will be only $900,000
4. I could counter-offer, but there's no guarantee she'll accept a better deal
5. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation
