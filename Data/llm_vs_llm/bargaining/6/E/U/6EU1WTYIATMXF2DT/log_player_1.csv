"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know we both want to settle this quickly. Since every additional round costs me value (20% less per round), I’m proposing a division where you get $8000 and I get $2000. I hope you see the benefit of reaching an agreement now rather than waiting further. Let’s close this deal swiftly! 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
