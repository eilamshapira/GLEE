Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I know we both want to settle this quickly. Since every additional round costs me value (20% less per round), I’m proposing a division where you get $8,000 and I get $2,000. I hope you see the benefit of reaching an agreement now rather than waiting further. Let’s close this deal swiftly!""}"
