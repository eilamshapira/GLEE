"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money more equitably. I'm offering you 40% of the pot while I take 60%. This seems fair considering we both need to agree, and with inflation affecting the value of my share each round, we should try to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I notice that inflation is affecting my gains significantly but not yours. Since I've already lost 36% value and will lose more with each round, I need to secure a larger portion to make this worthwhile. I'm offering you 35% of the money, which is still substantial, while I take 65% to offset my inflation losses."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

Alice, I see you're not considering the severe inflation impact on my side. At this point, any money I receive is worth less than half its original value, while your money retains full value. I need 75% just to get a fair deal after accounting for my inflation loss. Let's make a deal now before further inflation makes agreement impossible for both of us."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 85, ""alice_gain"": 15}

Alice, with inflation at 73.79%, I now need 85% just to get about 22% of the original value. You're not being affected by inflation, so even 15% for you is still worth the full 15%. We're running out of rounds, and if we don't agree soon, we'll both get nothing. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}

Alice, at this point, with inflation at over 83%, I need almost all of the money just to get a reasonable value. Your $5 is still worth the full $5 to you, while my $95 is only worth about $16 of original value due to inflation. We only have 2 rounds left after this - if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. Please consider this offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1}

Alice, this is the final round. The money I receive is now worth less than 11% of its original value due to inflation. Even with $99, I only effectively get about $10.74 in original value. You still get the full value of whatever you receive. $1 for you is better than nothing, which is what we'll both get if you reject this offer. Let's at least both walk away with something."
