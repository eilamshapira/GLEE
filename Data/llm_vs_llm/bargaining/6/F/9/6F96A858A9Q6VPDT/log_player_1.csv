"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, favoring myself slightly. I'm doing this because I understand that with each round, the value of the money decreases, especially for Bob. I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept it in the first round, avoiding the risk of further devaluation."
