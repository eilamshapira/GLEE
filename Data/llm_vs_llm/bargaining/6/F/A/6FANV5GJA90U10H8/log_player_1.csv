Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, this split makes more sense. I still think we both walk away happy with this adjusted division. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
