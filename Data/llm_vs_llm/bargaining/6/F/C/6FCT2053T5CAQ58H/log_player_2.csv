"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice offers me $40 out of $100
- If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 10% less for me
- In next round, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

While 40/60 split isn't perfectly fair, getting $40 now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds due to inflation. If I reject, my $40 would become worth $36 next round.
