"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and easy, Bob. I propose we split it 90/10 in my favor.  Take it or leave it. We don't have much time. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should reject this highly uneven split. While Alice is trying to pressure me with urgency, we have plenty of rounds left, and a 90/10 split heavily favors them. I can make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50/50 split, which is the most equitable solution.

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, a 90/10 split is far too uneven. I propose a fair 50/50 split - $5,000 each. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.""
