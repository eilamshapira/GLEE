"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, my $4000 would effectively become worth $3600 next round
5. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky

The offer isn't great, but considering the inflation penalty, it's better to accept now than risk getting less value in the next round.
