"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation hit on my share and any uncertainties down the line, I propose an even 50/50 split of the $1000000. This fair arrangement lets us both secure our earnings right away. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me, meaning:
   * The $1M will effectively be worth $800,000 to me
   * My maximum possible gain would be lower
3. Alice's opening with a perfectly fair split
4. There's risk in rejection as we don't know how inflation affects Alice
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

This is actually a very reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes it risky, and 50/50 is traditionally considered fair. I should take this deal.
