Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a more equitable division that still gives you a substantial amount while recognizing that inflation affects my share in future rounds. Let's conclude this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
