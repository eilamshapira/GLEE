"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair offer considering inflation. Let's keep it simple! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite imbalanced in her favor, with her taking $950,000 and offering me only $50,000 out of the $1,000,000. While there is 20% inflation per round for me, this initial split gives me only 5% of the total amount, which is very low regardless of inflation.

I'd be better off making a counter-proposal in the next round where I can suggest a more equitable division, even accounting for the 20% inflation that will affect my share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for my inflation penalty while still offering Alice a reasonable amount.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a more equitable division that still gives you a substantial amount while recognizing that inflation affects my share in future rounds. Let's conclude this fairly.""}"
