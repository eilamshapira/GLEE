"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her.

Given that inflation affects me more (20% per round) than Alice (10% per round), waiting is costlier for me. If I reject now and make a counter-offer, my purchasing power decreases faster than hers.

Let me calculate: If I reject and propose in round 2, my $40 would be worth only $32 (80% of original value). This means I'd need to get at least $50 in round 2 to match the current offer's value.

Since there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept my counter-offer, and my bargaining position weakens more quickly than hers with each round, I should accept this reasonable first offer.
