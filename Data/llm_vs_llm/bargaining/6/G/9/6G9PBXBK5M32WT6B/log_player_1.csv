"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a fair and reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll aim for a middle ground that could be appealing to both of us, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 evenly between us, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is affected. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me.

The offer is for $475,000, but due to the 20% decrease in value, the effective amount I would get is:
$475,000 * 0.8 = $380,000

Considering this, and knowing that Bob's gain is only devalued by 5%, I must weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus making a counteroffer in the next round, where the value of the money would decrease further for me.

Given the significant decrease in value for me and the relatively minor decrease for Bob, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.
