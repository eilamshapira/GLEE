6000.0,4000.0,I propose taking $6000 for myself and giving you $4000. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be fair and split the money equally.  A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we keep negotiating.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact on me.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation impacts you more, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation while still giving us both a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,
