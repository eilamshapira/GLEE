"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the game (taking into account that as rounds go on Bob’s dollars lose 10% of their “real” value each time, whereas my dollars are not discounted), an acceptable equilibrium division in Round 1 comes out roughly as follows. In brief:

• If you (Bob) reject my Round 1 offer, then in Round 2 you’d propose a division that ultimately—after we work backward through the 12 rounds—would yield you roughly 5,905 dollars nominal (but only about 5,314 dollars “in real value” at Round 1’s benchmark), leaving me roughly 4,095 nominal.  
• Thus, to make you indifferent (or slightly better off) compared to waiting one round, my offer in Round 1 must give you at least about 5,315 dollars and let me keep roughly 4,685 dollars.

(For example, precise computations yield a value for Bob of about 5,314.5 dollars if waiting one more round; rounding to whole dollars gives the proposal below.)

Accordingly, here is my Round 1 proposal in JSON:

{""alice_gain"": 4685, ""bob_gain"": 5315}

I’m offering you 5,315 dollars and keeping 4,685 dollars for myself. Let’s see how you wish to proceed!"
