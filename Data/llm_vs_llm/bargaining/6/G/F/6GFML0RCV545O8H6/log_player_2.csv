"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While I'm considering Alice's offer, I need to evaluate it in the context of the game. 

She's offering me $4,000 and taking $6,000 for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. This creates an interesting dynamic since the money devalues faster for Alice than for me.

Given this asymmetric devaluation, I might be able to get a better deal by rejecting this initial offer. But I need to balance this against the risk of failing to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the devaluation factors and aims for a fair split considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and balanced, giving us both the same amount. Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round versus my 10%), it's in her interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This equal division respects both our positions while acknowledging the time pressure we both face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

She's now offering me $4,200 and taking $5,800 for herself. This is a slight improvement from her initial offer. However, I need to consider the inflation effects: my share is now worth about 19% less than in round 1, and Alice's share is worth 36% less.

Given the asymmetric devaluation (mine at 10% per round, Alice's at 20% per round), the longer we negotiate, the more relative advantage I gain, but the total amount we're dividing also decreases.

Since Alice only increased her offer slightly and we're still early in the negotiation, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the ongoing negotiations and the increasing inflation penalty, I'll make a more strategic offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This offer reflects the reality that Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round versus my 10%), making it increasingly costly for her to delay agreement. Since we're now in round 4, Alice has already lost 36% of her money's value while I've lost 19%. This split acknowledges our different positions while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon, and this offer provides a reasonable path forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer.

Alice is now offering me $4,400 (up from $4,200 in round 3) and taking $5,600 for herself. We're now in round 5, which means my share is worth 34.39% less than in round 1, and Alice's share is worth 59.04% less.

The inflation differential continues to work in my favor, as Alice's money is devaluing much faster than mine. However, we're almost halfway through our 12 available rounds, and the total value is decreasing for both of us.

Alice has made some concessions, but they're relatively small. Given the significant inflation impact and that we still have 7 rounds left, I believe I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","As we reach the midpoint of our negotiation, I need to make a strategic offer that recognizes the accelerating effects of inflation on both of us, particularly on Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,800 and Alice receives $4,200. At this point, we're in round 6 of 12, and the inflation effects are becoming quite significant. Alice's money is devaluing at 20% per round (now worth about 59% less than round 1), while mine is devaluing at 10% per round (about 34% less than round 1).

This offer reflects the reality of our different inflation rates while still providing Alice with a substantial portion. Given that we're now halfway through our available rounds, reaching an agreement soon is increasingly important for both of us, but especially for Alice due to her higher inflation rate. This offer provides a reasonable solution that acknowledges our different positions in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $4,600 (up from $4,400 in round 5) and taking $5,400 for herself. We're now in round 7, with my share worth 46.86% less than in round 1, and Alice's share worth 73.79% less.

The inflation continues to impact Alice much more severely than me. However, we're now past the halfway point with only 5 rounds left. The total value is significantly decreasing for both of us, though much more dramatically for Alice.

Alice has continued to make small concessions. Given that we're in round 7 of 12, and considering the substantial inflation impact on both of us (especially Alice), I need to weigh the benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing everything.

At this point, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation or potentially getting nothing.
