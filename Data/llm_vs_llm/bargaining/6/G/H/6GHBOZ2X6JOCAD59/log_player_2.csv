"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's first offer. She's proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. Since there's no inflation for me, my $45 won't lose value in future rounds. However, I don't know if Alice faces inflation, which might affect her decision-making.

Given this is only the first round out of 12 possible rounds, I can reasonably expect to negotiate a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. The split isn't terribly unfair, but I believe I can achieve a more equal distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, as I believe a fair division would benefit both of us. Since there's no inflation for me and I don't know if Alice faces inflation, I'll propose an even split which is objectively fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally, which is the fairest approach for both of us."
