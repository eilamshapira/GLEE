"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the time constraint and the differential inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm offering Bob $40. This is more than half of the money. Because I want to finish the game early.
*   I take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Explanation:

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Although I initially wanted more, the risk of further inflation and the looming deadline makes accepting this offer the most rational choice. I don't want to risk losing everything."
