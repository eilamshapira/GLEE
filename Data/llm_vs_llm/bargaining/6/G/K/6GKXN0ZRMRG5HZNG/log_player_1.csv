"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I will analyze the situation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):**

    *   If I accept, I get $55. However, considering inflation, the money is now worth 10% less to me compared to the first round. So, the real value of $55 is equivalent to $55 * 0.9 = $49.50 in terms of the first round's value.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is giving me a slightly worse offer than in the previous round.

Given that this offer is close to half of the money, and with the effect of inflation, I should accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
