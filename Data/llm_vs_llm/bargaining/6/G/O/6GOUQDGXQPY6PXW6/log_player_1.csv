"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, let's factor in the inflation. My money is worth 10% less now (5% from round 1 + 5% from round 2). Bob's money was worth 20% less in the previous round, but I don't know if that trend continues. To be safe, I'll assume it does. That means Bob's money is worth at least 20% less. I still want a decent portion, but need to make it appealing.
