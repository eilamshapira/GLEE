"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you a much more reasonable split where I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. This is a fair proposal considering that we're both playing this game and should both benefit substantially. Keep in mind that if we continue to another round, inflation will reduce the value for me by 20%, and we'll both potentially lose out on total value. This offer gives you a significant portion while acknowledging my position as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
