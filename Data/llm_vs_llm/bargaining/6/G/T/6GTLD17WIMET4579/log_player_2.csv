"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make an offer
3. However, due to inflation, my money will be worth 5% less next round
4. $45 now is better than potentially getting $50 next round (which would be worth $47.50 due to inflation)
5. The split is reasonably fair, and starting a negotiation might lead to worse outcomes
