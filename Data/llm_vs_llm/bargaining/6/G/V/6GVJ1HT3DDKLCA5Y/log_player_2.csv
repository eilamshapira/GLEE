"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the constraints of the game. She's offering me 40% of the pot, while taking 60% for herself.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 5% less. So if we eventually agree on a split in the next round, my $40 would effectively be worth $40 Ã— 0.95 = $38, which is worse than accepting now.

Given the inflation penalty that only affects me, I should accept reasonable offers early rather than holding out for perfect fairness.
