"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a fair and reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll aim for a middle ground that could be appealing to both of us, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 evenly between us, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000.

Considering this, Bob's offer gives him $600,000 (at full value) and me $320,000 (due to the inflation effect). This doesn't seem like a fair split, especially since I'm the one affected by the inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I need to make a proposal that takes into account the diminishing value for me but also tries to find a mutually acceptable agreement.

In Round 2, the value for me was 80% of the original. Now, in Round 3, it will be 80% of 80%, which is 64% of the original value. So, if I propose $X for myself, its real value to me is 64% of $X.

To make a fair offer, I should consider that Bob's valuation remains constant, but I need to adjust for my decreasing valuation. Aiming for a compromise, I'll offer slightly more to Bob than I would in an even split, considering my devalued share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This offer gives me $450,000, which, at 64% value, equals $288,000 in real value to me, and gives Bob $550,000. This is a bit more favorable to Bob than an even split would be for me in real terms, but it's a compromise considering the inflation effect on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rate, the money I gain is now worth 80% * 80% * 80% = 51.2% of its original value. So, if Bob offers me $300,000, its actual value to me, considering the inflation, is 51.2% of $300,000, which equals $153,600.

Bob's offer gives him $700,000 at full value and me $153,600. This is a very uneven split, especially considering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation.

However, given the rapid decrease in the value of the money for me and the fact that Bob's offer, although unfavorable, still gives me some amount, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further inflation in the next round.

If I reject this offer and we go to the next round, the value of the money for me will decrease further. The next round would see the value at 80% * 51.2% = 40.96% of the original, making any potential gain even less valuable.

Considering these factors, I decide to accept Bob's offer, as the potential for further negotiation seems limited by the significant impact of inflation on my share.
