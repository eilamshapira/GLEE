Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This way we both get a significant amount, and you can still make a great profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's settle this quickly, I'm willing to give you a bit more than half, but the longer we wait, the less I'm willing to give due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
