"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll provide an offer to divide the $100. Since this is the first round and I'm playing as Alice, I want to make a fair offer while considering the 20% inflation penalty for each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of the money, giving us each $50. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. He's offering me $45 while taking $55 for himself.

Given the inflation effects, if I reject and we go to another round:
- The money would be worth 40% less to me in the next round (20% reduction per round)
- The money would be worth 10% less to Bob in the next round (5% reduction per round)

If I make a counterproposal in round 3, the decreasing value of money makes it hard to get a better outcome than what's being offered now. Bob's inflation rate is lower than mine, giving him an advantage in later rounds.
