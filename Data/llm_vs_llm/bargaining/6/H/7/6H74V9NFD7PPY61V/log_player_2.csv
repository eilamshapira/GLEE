Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Explanation: I offer Alice $45 and keep $55 for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less for me each round, I want to make a slightly better offer for myself to compensate for the inflation. However, I don't want to be too greedy, as Alice might reject my offer and I'll end up with even less money in the next round."
