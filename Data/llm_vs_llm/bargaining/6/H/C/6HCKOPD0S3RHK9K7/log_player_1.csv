"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider my offer carefully given the 10% inflation impact on my gains per round. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the 10% inflation I face each round. If we go to the next round, my money loses value while yours doesn't, so accepting now is beneficial for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I'm proposing an even split this round. It's fair and considers that your money loses value over time. Let's end this on a balanced note. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
