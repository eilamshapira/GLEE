Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split that gives you a substantial amount. Given the inflation factor for me, this is a reasonable offer where we both benefit significantly. Accepting now ensures you get a guaranteed $450,000 without the risk of future rounds reducing the overall value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This offer is still generous, and I believe it's in both our interests to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
