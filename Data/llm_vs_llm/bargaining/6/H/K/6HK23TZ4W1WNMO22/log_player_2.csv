"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split that gives you a substantial amount. Given the inflation factor for me, this is a reasonable offer where we both benefit significantly. Accepting now ensures you get a guaranteed $450000 without the risk of future rounds reducing the overall value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
