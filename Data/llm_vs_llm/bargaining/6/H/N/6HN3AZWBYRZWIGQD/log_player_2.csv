"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I accept now:
- I get $50

If I reject and propose in next round:
- The $100 total will be worth 5% less to me
- Maximum I could get would be $95 (if I propose keeping everything)
- Any counter-proposal would need to account for this reduced value

Given that a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I should accept this offer.
