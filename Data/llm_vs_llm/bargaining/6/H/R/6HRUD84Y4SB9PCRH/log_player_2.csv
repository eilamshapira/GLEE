"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject Alice's offer:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
2. I'll get to make a counter-proposal
3. But Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer gives me $50. If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I ask for more, the 5% inflation means I'd need to get at least $52.63 just to break even with the current $50 offer.

Given this is a fair split and the risk of losing value through inflation, I'll accept.
