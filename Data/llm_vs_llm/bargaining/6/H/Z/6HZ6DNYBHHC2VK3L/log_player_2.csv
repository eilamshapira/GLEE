"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let’s settle this now before any inflation bites. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. It’s a fair start—let’s secure our gains in round 1! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the 20% inflation that will affect my earnings if I reject and move to the next round. If I reject, the $100 will be worth only $80 to me in the next round, and my maximum possible gain would be $80 (if I proposed taking everything and Alice accepted).

Given this inflation effect, accepting $45 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie in the future rounds.
