Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting her much faster than it's hurting me. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat from the inflation. This is a fair offer for both of us, and with the inflation increasing, it's not worth risking getting a worse deal later."
