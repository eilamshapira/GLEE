"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I get 52% and you get 48%? This is still quite fair, and it compensates for the inflation I'm experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
