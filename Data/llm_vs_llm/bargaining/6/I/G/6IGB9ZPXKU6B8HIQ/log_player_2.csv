"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it evenly at $5000 each. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer since inflation will reduce the value of money with each round.

If I accept now, I get $5000 at full value.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will be worth 20% less to me, so I'd need to secure more than $6250 (because $6250 Ã— 0.8 = $5000) to make rejection worthwhile.

Given that Alice is offering an even 50-50 split in the first round, which is generally considered fair, and the significant inflation penalty I face, accepting now is the rational choice.
