"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this division fairly rewards both of us while I still get a significant part of the total. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is reasonable, given that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will be $1,000,000 Ã— 0.95 = $950,000. Even if I propose a more favorable split for myself, the total amount is already reduced.

Alice's current offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the total. While not an even split, it's a substantial amount, and waiting would reduce the overall pie.
