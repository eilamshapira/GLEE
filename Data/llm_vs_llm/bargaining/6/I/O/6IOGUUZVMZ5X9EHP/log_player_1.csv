Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid inflation losses. Let's not risk multiple rounds that will reduce the value for everyone. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
