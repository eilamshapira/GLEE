"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round, so my $400,000 would become worth $380,000
3. I could counter-offer in the next round, but Alice might reject
4. There's a risk of losing everything if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. This is just round 1, so I have room to negotiate

Given that this is the first round and the split seems a bit too favorable for Alice, I'll reject and make a counter-offer. The 5% inflation isn't severe enough yet to force me to accept such an uneven split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, acknowledging the inflation factor but seeking more fairness:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid inflation losses. Let's not risk multiple rounds that will reduce the value for everyone.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share while considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is now offering me $450,000 (9.75% less valuable than round 1, so effectively worth about $406,125)
2. This is better than her first offer of $400,000
3. If I reject, my next round's value will decrease another 5%
4. Alice seems to be moving towards a more reasonable split
5. However, her inflation rate (19%) is higher than mine (9.75%), which means she has more incentive to settle quickly
6. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12

While I could try to negotiate further, the inflation is starting to have a significant impact, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise. Given that her position is actually weaker due to her higher inflation rate, this offer is reasonable enough to accept.
