"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I will make the first offer, taking into account the inflation effect on my side. I will propose a division that gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. I need to consider that my gains are worth 10% less than before.

Bob is offering me $55. Since my money is worth 10% less, this is effectively worth $55 * 0.9 = $49.50 in the initial round's money.

If I reject, I make the offer in the next round, and my money will be worth 20% less than the first round. Also I don't know how much less money Bob's gain will be worth.

For the sake of not losing even more money, I'll accept this offer.
