"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, and she's taking advantage of my time pressure (inflation penalty).

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 5% less. So if I want $50 in the next round, it would only be worth $47.50 to me.

Given that any delay reduces my effective gain, and $40 is still a substantial amount (better than risking getting less in future rounds), I'll accept this offer.
