"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

Reasoning: Given that Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round while I face no depreciation, I have a stronger negotiating position. My initial offer gives Alice $200,000, which is still significant but reflects my advantage in the game. If she rejects, her next potential gains will be worth 20% less to her, while my potential gains maintain their value. This creates pressure for her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer is still too low, giving me only $100,000 while taking $900,000. Given that I don't face any depreciation and Alice faces significant depreciation (already at 36% and will increase to 49% next round), I have a strong position to negotiate for a better deal. Her money will be worth less each round, while mine maintains its value. I can afford to wait for a better offer or make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

Reasoning: I'm increasing my demand slightly from my previous offer because:
1. Alice's money is now worth significantly less to her due to the 36% depreciation
2. Her rejection of my previous offer (800k/200k) shows she's willing to play tough, but time is on my side
3. In the next round, her money will be worth 49% less, so this offer of 150k now is actually worth more to her than a larger amount in future rounds
4. I still maintain all of my negotiating power since my money doesn't depreciate

By offering $150,000 to Alice (which is still significant even with depreciation), I'm hoping to reach a deal before her potential gains depreciate further. If she rejects this, her next gains will be worth even less to her, strengthening my position further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: Despite Alice increasing her offer to me to $200,000, it's still not enough given the game dynamics. At this point, any money Alice receives is worth only about 41% of its original value to her (due to 59.04% depreciation). This means her $800,000 is effectively worth only around $328,000 to her in original value terms. Meanwhile, my money maintains its full value.

Given that we still have 7 rounds left, and each round makes Alice's position weaker due to increasing depreciation, I can continue to hold out for a better deal. In the next round, I can make an offer that takes into account her rapidly diminishing position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

Reasoning: I'm increasing my demand further because:
1. Alice's money has depreciated by 59.04%, meaning any money she gets is worth less than half of its nominal value to her
2. In the next round, her depreciation will be even worse (around 67%)
3. We're halfway through the rounds, and time pressure is building
4. My $900k/$100k split might seem aggressive, but for Alice:
   - Taking $100k now at ~41% value is better than potentially getting nothing
   - If she rejects, any future gains will be worth even less to her
   - The threat of both of us getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds becomes more relevant

Given these factors, Alice should seriously consider accepting this offer, as waiting longer will only worsen her position. My money maintains its full value, so I can afford to be patient."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: Even though Alice has increased her offer to me to $300,000, I should still reject because:
1. Her $700,000 is now worth only about $183,470 to her (due to 73.79% depreciation)
2. We still have 5 rounds left
3. The next round will bring her depreciation to around 79%, making her position even weaker
4. My money maintains its full value, so I have no pressure to accept a suboptimal offer

The rapidly increasing depreciation means Alice's bargaining position is getting significantly weaker with each round. She's showing willingness to increase her offers (from $200k to $300k), which suggests my strategy is working. I can continue to hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000}

Reasoning: I'm further increasing my demand because:
1. Alice's money has depreciated by 73.79%, meaning her money is worth only about 26.21% of its original value
2. In the next round, her depreciation will be around 79%
3. We have only 4 rounds left after this one
4. For Alice:
   - $50,000 now (worth about $13,105 in original value to her) is still better than nothing
   - If she rejects, any future gains will be worth even less
   - The risk of both getting nothing if we don't agree within the remaining rounds is becoming very real

This aggressive offer reflects the extremely strong negotiating position I have due to:
- My money maintaining its full value
- Her severe depreciation
- The approaching deadline
- The fact that she's already shown willingness to make increasing offers

She should seriously consider accepting this offer as her position will only get worse in remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: I should continue to reject because:
1. Alice's $600,000 is now worth only about $100,680 to her (due to 83.22% depreciation)
2. We still have 3 rounds left
3. The next round will bring her depreciation to about 86.6%
4. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure as she's steadily increasing her offers (from $300k to $400k)
5. My money maintains its full value

Even though Alice has increased her offer again, the extreme depreciation she faces means she's in a very weak bargaining position. Her continued increases in offers (from 100k → 200k → 300k → 400k) show she's becoming more desperate. In the next round, I can make an even more aggressive offer as we approach the final rounds and her money continues to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 980000, ""alice_gain"": 20000}

Reasoning: I'm making an extremely aggressive offer because:
1. Alice's money has depreciated by 83.22%, meaning her money is worth only about 16.78% of its original value
2. Only 2 rounds remain after this one
3. For Alice:
   - $20,000 now (worth about $3,356 in original value to her) is still better than nothing
   - The next round will have ~86.6% depreciation
   - The final round will have ~89.3% depreciation
   - The risk of both getting zero is very real with only 2 rounds left

Alice has demonstrated she's feeling the pressure by steadily increasing her offers (100k → 200k → 300k → 400k). The combination of:
- Extreme depreciation on her side
- Only 2 rounds remaining
- Risk of both getting nothing
- My money maintaining full value

Should make this offer, while very low, still more attractive than risking further depreciation or getting nothing. She's in an extremely weak negotiating position at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: Even though Alice has offered a 50-50 split, I should still reject because:
1. Her $500,000 is now worth only about $53,700 to her (due to 89.26% depreciation)
2. This is the second-to-last round
3. My money maintains its full value
4. She's shown a pattern of increasing offers (100k → 200k → 300k → 400k → 500k)

With only one round left after this, and her money continuing to depreciate (will be around 91.4% in the final round), I can make one final aggressive offer. Her steady increase in offers shows she's trying to avoid getting nothing, which puts me in a very strong position for the final round. The risk of both getting nothing if we don't agree in the final round should make her more willing to accept an even more favorable offer to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000}

Reasoning: This is the final round - if Alice rejects this offer, we both get nothing. I'm making an extremely aggressive offer because:

1. Alice's money has depreciated by 89.26%, and in this round it's even worse (around 91.4%)
2. This is the FINAL round - if Alice rejects, we BOTH get zero
3. For Alice, the choice is now binary:
   - Accept $10,000 (worth only about $860 in original value to her, but still > $0)
   - Reject and get absolutely nothing

The game theory here is clear:
- Any positive amount is rationally better than zero for Alice
- She has no more rounds to negotiate
- She has shown she wants to avoid getting nothing by steadily increasing her offers
- The only rational choice for her is to accept any positive amount rather than get nothing

This offer, while extremely favorable to me, should still be accepted by a rational Alice as it's better than the alternative of zero."
