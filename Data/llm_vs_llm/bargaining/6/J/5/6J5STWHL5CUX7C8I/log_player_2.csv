Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's crucial to reach a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Alice's Offer:** While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. 
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the potential gains shrink. Delaying further significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.

I'm hoping to push Alice towards a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my asking price to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is more reasonable given the circumstances.
* **Urgency:** Time is running out, and a deal needs to be struck soon."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds where the money will be worth significantly less."
