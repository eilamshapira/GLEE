"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob to start.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally, 50-50. This is the fairest division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation rates affecting both of us, I need to make a strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, which is still substantial, while I take $55 to help offset the faster inflation rate that's affecting me (20% per round versus your 10%). This is a fair adjustment considering the different inflation rates we face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
