Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, I need to push for a better split. Accepting 45 now means getting even less due to inflation, and it's likely Alice is feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm position. It also creates a potential pattern we can both follow to settle quickly in later rounds."
