"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair division where I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty in future rounds, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives both of us a substantial amount while slightly favoring me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting a smaller portion than I initially proposed, the 20% inflation penalty for me means delays are costly. Taking $480,000 now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts."
