"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is 100 * 0.8 = $80.
To maximize my gain, I'll make a proposal where I get a bit more than half of the original $100, considering the reduced value.
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $52, but its value to me is reduced by 36% due to inflation. So, the actual value I consider is 52 * 0.64 = $33.28.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round. 

Given the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I think accepting this offer might be the best option.
