"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $45
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the value will decrease by 5% next round, so her $55 would be worth only $52.25 to her
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for the next round
5. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer

Given this analysis, I'll reject this offer since I believe I can get a better deal next round when Alice's time value has decreased.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer considering:

1. Alice's money is now worth 5% less to her than in round 1
2. She knows if she rejects, her next round value will decrease another 5%
3. I should offer her enough to make accepting more attractive than waiting
4. Her $55 from last round would only be worth $52.25 to her now

I'll propose a split that gives me slightly more than her first offer while still being attractive enough for her to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a fair split that gives us both equal amounts, and considering her time depreciation, she should be motivated to accept rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $48 now
2. Her $52 is worth about 9.75% less to her (approximately $47 in round 1 value for her)
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - Alice's money will be worth about 14.25% less next round
   - But I risk further back-and-forth that might be suboptimal

This is actually a decent offer considering:
- It's better than her first offer ($48 vs $45)
- The time pressure is affecting Alice more than me
- The improvement from further negotiation might be marginal
- There's a risk of losing value in continued negotiation

I'll accept this offer as it's a reasonable improvement from the initial offer, and the marginal benefit of continuing doesn't outweigh the risk.
