4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I'm rejecting your first offer because our different inflation rates need to be considered. Your money depreciates much faster (20% per round) than mine (5%). I'm offering you $4500 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get after another round of negotiation due to your higher depreciation rate. This is a fair deal that acknowledges both our positions.",Bob,2,
