"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's wrap this up quickly. I'll take 60%, and you'll get 40%. It's a fair split considering time depreciation. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm rejecting your first offer because our different inflation rates need to be considered. Your money depreciates much faster (20% per round) than mine (5%). I'm offering you $4500 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get after another round of negotiation due to your higher depreciation rate. This is a fair deal that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
