"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's wrap this up quickly. I'll take 60%, and you'll get 40%. It's a fair split considering time depreciation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation rates for both of us.

Alice is offering me 40% ($4,000) and keeping 60% ($6,000) for herself.

If I reject this offer and move to the next round:
- My money will be worth 5% less
- Alice's money will be worth 20% less

This gives me some leverage, as Alice faces much steeper depreciation than I do. If we go to another round, I can propose a more favorable split for myself, and Alice would have strong incentive to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes our different inflation rates into account.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm rejecting your first offer because our different inflation rates need to be considered. Your money depreciates much faster (20% per round) than mine (5%). I'm offering you $4,500 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get after another round of negotiation due to your higher depreciation rate. This is a fair deal that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
