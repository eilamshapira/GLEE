"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I need to move quickly due to inflation affecting my gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting your gains more than mine, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. It's a fair adjustment considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Even with 20% inflation, getting $48 worth of value (60 * 0.8) from my original proposal would be better than getting $32 worth of value (40 * 0.8) from Bob's proposal. I'll make a new offer in the next round, though I'll need to consider that it will be worth even less to me then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Due to the 40% inflation penalty I'm now facing, I need a larger share to get fair value. This 75-25 split will give me effectively $45 in value while you get $25 - similar to a fair split of the original value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you, yet still provides you with a reasonable portion given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 48.8% inflation, my $35 is worth about $17.92 in original value. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 60% inflation, making even a large share worth significantly less. This isn't a great outcome, but further negotiation will likely lead to even worse results for me due to the increasing inflation penalty."
