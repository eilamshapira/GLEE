"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm making the first move. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60, claiming she deserves more for making the first move. However, if I reject and move to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of the money by 20% for me, meaning the total $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

If I reject now and propose a better split next round, I'd need to offer Alice something she'll accept while still getting more than $40 (adjusted for inflation) for myself. Given the inflation penalty, I should probably accept this offer unless I think I can get significantly more in the next round.
