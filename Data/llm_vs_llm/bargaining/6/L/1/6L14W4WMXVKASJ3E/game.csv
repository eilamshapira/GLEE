500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split this 50-50 so we both walk away happy. Fair and square!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's get down to business. I take 60%, you take 40%.  This is a strong starting point for negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Since the value for you decreased, let's try this: I'll take 55% and you get 45%. It's a better balance with the inflation effect in mind.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't getting us anywhere.  The value is decreasing with each round. I'll be fair - 58% for me, 42% for you.  This is a compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, considering inflation's impact, I'm proposing 52% for me and 48% for you. Let's make this work for both of us!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, I'm holding firm.  57% for me is the current offer.  We need to close this deal soon, and this is a reasonable split considering the time pressure and decreasing value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, let's settle on a 51-49 split. This is close to equal and accounts for the inflation impact on you. Let's finalize this!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
440000.0,560000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. 56-44.  Take it or leave it. We're running out of time, and the value diminishes with every passing moment.  Let's be done with this.",Bob,8,

505000.0,495000.0,"Bob, just a small shift: 50.5% for me and 49.5% for you. We're nearly there!",Alice,9,
