"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this 50-50 so we both walk away happy. Fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's get down to business. I take 60%, you take 40%.  This is a strong starting point for negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since the value for you decreased, let's try this: I'll take 55% and you get 45%. It's a better balance with the inflation effect in mind. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her proposed gain is getting disproportionately larger. I need to push for a more favorable split before the money value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't getting us anywhere.  The value is decreasing with each round. I'll be fair - 58% for me, 42% for you.  This is a compromise considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering inflation's impact, I'm proposing 52% for me and 48% for you. Let's make this work for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not acceptable. While it's closer to a more even split, the decreasing value means I need to secure a larger percentage in the early rounds. I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm.  57% for me is the current offer.  We need to close this deal soon, and this is a reasonable split considering the time pressure and decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's settle on a 51-49 split. This is close to equal and accounts for the inflation impact on you. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is excruciating, but I have to reject it.  While a 49% share is substantial, getting this late in the game with the inflation working against me means I need to push for a slight advantage in the split to make it worthwhile. 

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I have to gamble that she's also feeling the pressure to settle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 560000, ""alice_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 56-44.  Take it or leave it. We're running out of time, and the value diminishes with every passing moment.  Let's be done with this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, just a small shift: 50.5% for me and 49.5% for you. We're nearly there! 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is extremely frustrating, but I have to accept.  The value of the money has eroded significantly, and with only three rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high.  Alice has played this cleverly, and while I'm not thrilled, getting 49.5% now is better than nothing later."
