"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 each. While this appears fair on the surface, I should factor in the inflation rates.

If I reject this offer and make my own proposal next round, the total value decreases - it's worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me and $9,000 to Alice in the next round.

Given this information, an even split now gives me $5,000, which is better than what I might get if we go to additional rounds with decreasing value.
