"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the full $1,000,000 in this round. Given that any delay only causes my share to discount by 20% per round while your value remains unchanged, you wonâ€™t gain by waiting. Thus, accepting this offer now is as good for you as any later alternative. Let's settle immediately!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a chance to take $50000 right now.  Every round you wait, that amount shrinks. It's time to be practical. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, given that my share decreases in value each round due to inflation, accepting your offer of $50,000 now is in my best interest. Waiting will further erode my effective gain, so it's practical to settle here.""}"
