"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the full $1000000 in this round. Given that any delay only causes my share to discount by 20% per round while your value remains unchanged, you wonâ€™t gain by waiting. Thus, accepting this offer now is as good for you as any later alternative. Let's settle immediately! 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's logic is designed to pressure me, but it's deeply flawed. While it's true my share doesn't technically deflate,  waiting allows me to apply pressure and aim for a more favorable outcome in later rounds.  There's no reason for me to settle for zero right now."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a chance to take $50,000 right now.  Every round you wait, that amount shrinks. It's time to be practical.""}"
