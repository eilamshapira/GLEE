550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money with $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the different inflation rates affecting us. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I need slightly more now to compensate for that disadvantage. If we don't agree quickly, we both lose more with each round.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate affecting you, but I believe a more balanced split is appropriate. I'm offering you $475000 and $525000 for me. This still gives you a substantial portion while accounting for both our interests. If we continue to the next round, we both lose value - you'll lose 10% and I'll lose 5%. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need to consider the cumulative effects of inflation. After 3 rounds, my money is worth 19% less while yours is only worth 9.75% less. I'm meeting you in the middle with $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This accounts for my higher inflation rate while being more balanced than my initial offer. If we continue negotiating, the difference in our inflation rates will make us both worse off, but me significantly more so. Let's reach an agreement now to maximize our combined value.",Alice,3,
