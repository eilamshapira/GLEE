"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money with $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the different inflation rates affecting us. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I need slightly more now to compensate for that disadvantage. If we don't agree quickly, we both lose more with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, weighing the current split against potential future offers.

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total. She's arguing that she deserves more because her inflation rate is higher.

If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. However, it will be worth 10% less to Alice, which gives me some negotiating leverage.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and the declining value due to inflation, I should carefully consider this first offer rather than automatically rejecting it.

While I could try for a better deal, $450,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's risk in prolonging negotiations.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges our different inflation rates but is more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate affecting you, but I believe a more balanced split is appropriate. I'm offering you $475,000 and $525,000 for me. This still gives you a substantial portion while accounting for both our interests. If we continue to the next round, we both lose value - you'll lose 10% and I'll lose 5%. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need to consider the cumulative effects of inflation. After 3 rounds, my money is worth 19% less while yours is only worth 9.75% less. I'm meeting you in the middle with $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This accounts for my higher inflation rate while being more balanced than my initial offer. If we continue negotiating, the difference in our inflation rates will make us both worse off, but me significantly more so. Let's reach an agreement now to maximize our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $475,000, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $450,000. She's making a valid point about the cumulative effects of inflation - her money is already worth 19% less compared to my 9.75% loss.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where the money will be worth even less to both of us. I'll get to make the next offer, but we're already seeing significant erosion in value.

Alice has met me halfway between our previous positions, which shows good-faith negotiation. Her current offer gives me 47.5% of the total, which is reasonable.

Considering the progressive deterioration of value and the fact that we're only in round 3 of potentially 12 rounds, accepting this compromise now preserves more value for both of us than continuing to negotiate.
