"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a larger portion of the money, I should consider the impact of inflation on future negotiations. Since inflation affects Alice more than me (10% per round for her vs 0% for me), I have a better negotiating position by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, considering that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I face none. This means her position weakens with each passing round, giving me leverage.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, which is still a substantial amount. Given that your money loses 10% value each round, accepting now would be better than waiting for further rounds where your share could diminish in real value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer, giving me $450,000 now instead of the initial $400,000. Since she's facing inflation (her money is now worth 19% less than in round 1), she's becoming more willing to compromise.

However, I still have a strong negotiating position since I face no inflation. With more rounds remaining and Alice's position weakening with each round, I can likely secure an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has rejected my previous offer and made a counter-offer, I'll adjust my proposal to be more appealing while still leveraging my advantage with inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering you $350,000, which is still a significant amount. Consider that with each passing round, your share loses 10% more value due to inflation while mine doesn't. At this point, the real value of your money is already diminished by nearly 30% compared to round 1. It's in your interest to accept this offer now rather than face further devaluation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has improved her offer to an even 50-50 split. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer. She's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, as her money has lost 34.39% of its value since round 1.

While I could continue to hold out for an even better deal given my inflation-free position, a 50-50 split is fair and there's always risk in continuing negotiations. Since we're already in round 5 of 12, there's value in reaching an agreement.
