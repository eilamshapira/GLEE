"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I get $5,000 next round, it would only be worth $4,000 to me
5. Given this, getting $4,000 now is probably better than trying to negotiate for more in the next round
