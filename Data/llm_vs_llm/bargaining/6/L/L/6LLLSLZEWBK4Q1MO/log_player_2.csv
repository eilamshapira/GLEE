"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the inflation rate is 20% per round, I need to consider whether it's better to accept this offer now or try to negotiate a better deal in a future round.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in round 2, but the total pot would be worth 20% less to me. So waiting means I need to secure more than 40/(1-0.2) = 50 dollars in round 2 to come out ahead.

While 40% isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly. With the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, I'll accept this offer.
