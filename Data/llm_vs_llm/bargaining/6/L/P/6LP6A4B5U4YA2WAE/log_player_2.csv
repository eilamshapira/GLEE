"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the inflation effect. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that I face a certain 20% loss with each round and there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept my counter-offer, I think it's reasonable to accept this first offer.
