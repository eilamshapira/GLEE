"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this negotiation, I need to be strategic, considering the inflation rates and the fact that I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This is a fair starting offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable for Bob to consider, especially given that he faces a lower inflation rate than I do if we proceed to the next round."
