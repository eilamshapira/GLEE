"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to get the best out of our deal considering the 10% discount each round, I propose that I take $5263 and you get $4737. This split reflects the fair equilibrium outcome when discounting is taken into account. I hope youâ€™ll accept this offer so that we both walk away with as much value as possible! 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,737 while she gets $5,263 out of the $10,000.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $9,000 total). While I could then propose a more favorable split for myself, Alice could also reject my offer, leading to further devaluation.

The proposed split isn't 50/50, but it does give me a substantial portion while avoiding the risk of further devaluation. Given the diminishing value with each round, accepting now secures a definite amount rather than risking a potentially smaller amount later.
