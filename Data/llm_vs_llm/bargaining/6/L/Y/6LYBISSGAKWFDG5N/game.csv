60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal for the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% in value. If you reject now, you'll end up with almost nothing in the next round. I’m offering you $1 (which is worth 90 cents to you today) so you can secure something rather than watch your share diminish further. Accept this offer, and let's finish the game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
20.0,80.0,"Bob, I understand the situation with inflation, but your previous offer was exploitative. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2.0,98.0,"Alice, every round that passes further erodes the value of your share – in round 4, your dollars are worth only about 73% of their original value, and waiting for round 5 will shrink them to roughly 66%. I know you might be hoping for a better division, but by holding out you risk ending up with even less. I'm offering you $2 nominal (worth about $1.46 in today’s terms) so you can preserve as much value as possible. Accept this offer and let's finalize the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
10.0,90.0,"Bob, it's clear you're trying to pressure me, but I'm not going to accept a ridiculously low offer. This is my last offer. If you reject, we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,5,
