Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% in value. If you reject now, you'll end up with almost nothing in the next round. I’m offering you $1 (which is worth 90 cents to you today) so you can secure something rather than watch your share diminish further. Accept this offer, and let's finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round that passes further erodes the value of your share – in round 4, your dollars are worth only about 73% of their original value, and waiting for round 5 will shrink them to roughly 66%. I know you might be hoping for a better division, but by holding out you risk ending up with even less. I'm offering you $2 nominal (worth about $1.46 in today’s terms) so you can preserve as much value as possible. Accept this offer and let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98
