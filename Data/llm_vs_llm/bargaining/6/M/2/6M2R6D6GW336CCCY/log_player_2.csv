Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical, Alice. I'll take a bigger share, but you'll still get a significant amount. Time is money, and we're losing it with every passing round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to take a bit less than half due to the inflation, but we should both still get a fair share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, whereas pushing for more risks a worse outcome. 
* **Uncertainty about Alice's Inflation:** We don't know how inflation is impacting Alice. She might be more willing to accept a smaller share in future rounds if her money is also losing value. However, that's a gamble.

It's better to take a slightly smaller but guaranteed share now than risk getting even less later."
