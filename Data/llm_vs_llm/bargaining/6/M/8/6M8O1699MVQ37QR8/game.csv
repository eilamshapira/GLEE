500.0,9500.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $500 and you take $9500. Considering that if we move to the next round your money’s worth only 95% and mine only 80% of today’s value, this offer exactly matches your round‐2 prospects while avoiding further loss of value for both of us. Let’s settle now and keep the full pie as intact as possible!",Alice,1,

1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to take a slight cut to avoid further devaluation.  Let's split it 9000/1000.  It's in our best interest to come to an agreement now.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. Given that if we continue further the proposals and inflation effects would significantly lower my share’s real value, I believe it’s best for both of us to settle now. I accept your proposal as it secures a higher real value for me compared to what I’d expect in later rounds.",Alice,2,accept
