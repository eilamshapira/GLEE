"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500, ""bob_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $500 and you take $9,500. Considering that if we move to the next round your money’s worth only 95% and mine only 80% of today’s value, this offer exactly matches your round‐2 prospects while avoiding further loss of value for both of us. Let’s settle now and keep the full pie as intact as possible!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to take a slight cut to avoid further devaluation.  Let's split it 9000/1000.  It's in our best interest to come to an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. Given that if we continue further the proposals and inflation effects would significantly lower my share’s real value, I believe it’s best for both of us to settle now. I accept your proposal as it secures a higher real value for me compared to what I’d expect in later rounds.""}"
