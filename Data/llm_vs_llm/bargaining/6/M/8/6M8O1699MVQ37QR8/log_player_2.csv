"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $500 and you take $9500. Considering that if we move to the next round your money’s worth only 95% and mine only 80% of today’s value, this offer exactly matches your round‐2 prospects while avoiding further loss of value for both of us. Let’s settle now and keep the full pie as intact as possible! 
# Bob gain: 9500 
# Alice gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
