"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to ensure we both benefit fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 offer now:
   * My $50 is worth 5% less due to inflation â†’ Effective value = $47.50
   * This is less than what I proposed initially, but still significant

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * I could propose again, but the value would decrease further
   * No guarantee Bob would accept my next offer

Since the value is decreasing with each round and there's no guarantee of a better outcome later, I should accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk further value loss.
