"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair initial offer that gives both of us a good portion of the money. Since inflation will affect Bob more severely (20% per round versus my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that considers our different inflation rates:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a bit more than my initial proposal. Given that Bob faces a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 5%), this offer should be more appealing to him. The longer we negotiate, the more value we both lose, but Bob loses value much faster. This offer balances fairness with the economic pressure of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
