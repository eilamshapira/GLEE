"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 10% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to offer Bob a substantial portion while still maintaining a slight advantage for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation, so I believe this is a reasonable first proposal that has a good chance of being accepted."
