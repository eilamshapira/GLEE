"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000 (45%)
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * The maximum I could propose would be worth only $800,000 to me
   * I don't know how inflation affects Alice

$450,000 is a reasonable first offer. While it's slightly less than half, the risk of losing 20% value in the next round makes this offer attractive. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $562,500 (450,000/0.8) in the next round just to break even.
