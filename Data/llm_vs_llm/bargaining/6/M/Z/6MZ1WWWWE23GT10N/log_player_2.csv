"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully here. Alice is proposing an even split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000. However, with the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, waiting means any future money will be worth less to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the $10,000 pot would only be worth $8,000 to me due to 20% inflation. Even if I could secure more than $5,000 in the next round, I need to consider if it would exceed the current $5,000 offer after accounting for inflation.

Given that we have a fair 50-50 split on the table with no inflation penalty yet, this is actually a reasonable starting offer.
