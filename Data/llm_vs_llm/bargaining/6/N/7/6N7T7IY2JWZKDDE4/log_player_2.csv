Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that.  How about a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for an equal split this time. I propose 50% for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While tempting, I'm banking on Alice being more sensitive to the shrinking pot than she's letting on.  We'll see if I'm right."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""The pot is shrinking Alice!  We need to decide quickly.  I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we need to settle this soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split this time. This way you still get a reasonable amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is trying to squeeze me.  While not ideal, accepting this prevents me from getting potentially much less later on."
