"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%). If I reject, we move to the next round where:
1. I get to make an offer
2. The money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation
3. There's risk Alice rejects my counter-offer

With 5% inflation, if I reject, the maximum I could get next round would be worth 5% less to me. So even if I got a better nominal amount, I need to factor that in.

$400,000 right now is better than risking a rejection and dealing with inflation. While not exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable first offer.
