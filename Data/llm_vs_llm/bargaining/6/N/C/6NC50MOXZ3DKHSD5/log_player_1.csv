"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation factors for both myself and Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less each round for me, and 10% less each round for Bob, there's an incentive to reach an agreement quickly, especially for me.

I'll propose a fair split that gives Bob a slight advantage to encourage him to accept right away:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
