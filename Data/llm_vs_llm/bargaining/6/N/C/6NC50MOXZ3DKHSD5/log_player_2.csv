"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total value of the money is now:
For me: $100 * 0.9 = $90
For Alice: $100 * 0.8 = $80

I'll make an offer that is slightly in my favor, considering the decreasing value.
