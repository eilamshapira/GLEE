"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
1. Alice is offering me $300,000 and keeping $700,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me next round
3. In the next round, my $300,000 would effectively be worth $240,000
4. I'd need to secure significantly more than $300,000 in the next round to make rejection worthwhile
5. Given that Alice's money only devalues by 5% per round, she has a stronger negotiating position

While I'd prefer a more even split, considering the steep 20% inflation penalty for me versus Alice's 5%, this isn't a terrible first offer. If I reject, I'd need to get a much better deal next round to overcome the 20% loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances on getting a better deal, as this is just the first round and the split seems too unfavorable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Due to inflation, the money is now worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice
2. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering she knows my money devalues faster than hers
3. A more equitable split would be fair, but I need to account for Alice's better negotiating position

I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to make it attractive:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This is a much more equitable division that still gives Alice a slight advantage. I'm offering her more than half while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. Given that she faces only 5% inflation compared to my 20%, this should be an attractive offer that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My inflation penalty is now 36%, so any amount I receive is worth significantly less
2. Alice has only lost 9.75% to inflation
3. The $350,000 offer would be worth effectively $224,000 (considering 36% inflation)
4. If I reject, next round I'll face 48.8% inflation (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8)
5. Alice has improved her offer from $300,000 to $350,000, showing some willingness to negotiate

While this isn't an ideal split, the rapidly increasing inflation penalty makes further negotiation risky. If I reject, I would need to secure a much better deal next round to overcome the additional 20% inflation penalty, and Alice knows this.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the increasing inflation penalty makes further negotiation too risky, and Alice has shown some improvement in her offer."
