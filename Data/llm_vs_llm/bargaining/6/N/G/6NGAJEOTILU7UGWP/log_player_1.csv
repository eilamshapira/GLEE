"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. In Round 1, my offer was worth $6000, but now, in Round 2, the effective value of money to me is reduced by 20%.

This means that the value of the $4500 offered by Bob in Round 2 is not equivalent to $4500 in round 1.

I will now calculate the actual value I would be receiving, after accounting for inflation. In the first round, the 6000$ proposal was worth 6000$.
In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, which means I have effectively 80% of the original value.
So, the effective value of $4500 in round 2 is:
$4500 * 0.8 = $3600

Given that my initial offer was for 6000$ (in effective value), and the current offer is only worth 3600$, I must **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer in Round 3. The inflation is still a factor. Now, the effective value of money to me is 80% of what it was in Round 2, which means it's now 80% * 80% = 64% of its original value in Round 1.

Knowing the inflation, here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
