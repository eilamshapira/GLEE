4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, since I'm facing 5% inflation each round, I need to ask for a slightly higher share to offset that risk. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is fair considering my declining purchasing power with each round. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value, and you might end up with less too. This is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,

4750.0,5250.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to protect my interests. I'm willing to compromise at a 47.5/52.5 split. This way, you get more than half to account for your inflation, but it's still close to an even split. Let's settle this and move on.",Alice,3,
