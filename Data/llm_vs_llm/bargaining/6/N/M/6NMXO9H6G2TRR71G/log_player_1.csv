"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since I'm facing 5% inflation each round, I need to ask for a slightly higher share to offset that risk. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is fair considering my declining purchasing power with each round. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value, and you might end up with less too. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4750,
  ""bob_gain"": 5250,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to protect my interests. I'm willing to compromise at a 47.5/52.5 split. This way, you get more than half to account for your inflation, but it's still close to an even split. Let's settle this and move on.""
