"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer and how the inflation will affect me if I reject and propose in the next round.

If I accept, I get $5,000 now.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, so the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 from my perspective. If I then proposed a better split for myself (say 60/40), I might get $6,000, which after inflation is $5,700. That's better than taking $5,000 now.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and inflation compounds for me each round, it's strategic to make a counter-offer now rather than accepting an even split immediately.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm facing while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, since I'm facing 5% inflation each round, I need to ask for a slightly higher share to offset that risk. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is fair considering my declining purchasing power with each round. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value, and you might end up with less too. This is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to protect my interests. I'm willing to compromise at a 47.5/52.5 split. This way, you get more than half to account for your inflation, but it's still close to an even split. Let's settle this and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effect.

At round 3, I face 9.75% inflation, meaning the $10,000 pot is worth about $9,025 to me. Alice has offered me $5,250, which is better than the initial $5,000 offer.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face further inflation (approximately 14.75% total), making the $10,000 worth about $8,525 to me. To beat Alice's current offer after this inflation, I'd need to secure significantly more, which might be harder to get Alice to accept.

Alice has acknowledged my inflation concern and moved toward a compromise that gives me more than half. This is a reasonable offer considering the mounting inflation penalty I face with each round.
