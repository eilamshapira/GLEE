"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the inflation effect on my share.

With a 5% inflation per round, and potentially 12 rounds, I need to weigh accepting now versus making a counter-offer. 

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting more in later rounds with reduced value due to inflation. If I reject and we go through multiple rounds, even a larger share could be worth less to me.
