"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs 5% per round), I should try to secure a fair deal now.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have more urgency to reach an agreement due to my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to inflation, for me the $40 is actually worth $32 (20% less)
2. For Bob, his $60 is worth $57 (5% less)
3. If I reject and propose in the next round:
   - Values will depreciate further (40% total for me, 10% for Bob)
   - Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again
   - We'll both lose more value to inflation

Given the significant impact of inflation on my portion and the risk of further depreciation, I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less in future rounds.
