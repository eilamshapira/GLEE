"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer from Alice. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $90 total). While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing more value through inflation if we keep going back and forth.

$40 is a decent amount, even though it's less than half. If we continue negotiating, we risk diminishing the total value significantly.
