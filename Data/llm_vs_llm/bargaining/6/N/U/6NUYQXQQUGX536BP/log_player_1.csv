"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's agree now and avoid future inflation losses. Accepting now means you secure 310K in full value rather than facing a 10% discount in later rounds. I believe this 69/31 split is fair given our different discount factors. Looking forward to a quick agreement!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a 60/40 split is fairer given the different inflation rates.  Let's work together to get a deal before we lose too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
