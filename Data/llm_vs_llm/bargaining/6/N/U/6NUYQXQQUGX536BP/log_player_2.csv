"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's agree now and avoid future inflation losses. Accepting now means you secure 310K in full value rather than facing a 10% discount in later rounds. I believe this 69/31 split is fair given our different discount factors. Looking forward to a quick agreement! 
# Bob gain: 310000 
# Alice gain: 690000
