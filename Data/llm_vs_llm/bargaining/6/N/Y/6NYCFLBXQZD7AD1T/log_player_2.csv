"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- It's a 50-50 split, which is fair
- If I reject, the total value will decrease by 5% (to $9,500)
- Even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower
- This is a reasonable first offer that gives me $5,000
