"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm facing steeper inflation per round (20% vs 5%)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. My portion (450000) is worth 20% less due to inflation
* Actual value to me: 450000 * 0.8 = 360000

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
* Money will be worth another 20% less for me
* Even if I got a larger share, it would be significantly devalued
* Bob only faces 5% inflation, so he has less pressure to accept

3. This offer gives me 45% of the total, which is reasonable considering:
* The inflation penalty I've already incurred
* The risk of further devaluation if negotiations continue
* Bob has a stronger negotiating position due to lower inflation pressure
