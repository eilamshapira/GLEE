"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. Let me consider this.

If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I'll make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the total value will decrease - it would be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

This means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me and only $800,000 to Alice in the next round. Since Alice has a much higher inflation rate, I have negotiating leverage if we continue to later rounds.

I'll reject this offer since I can propose a more favorable split next round that would still be rational for Alice to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less this round, so the entire $1,000,000 is only worth $800,000 to her. If I offer her slightly more than what she would get in the next round after another 20% inflation, she should rationally accept.

If we go to round 3, the money would be worth only $640,000 to Alice (another 20% reduction). So I should offer her somewhat more than that to make accepting now attractive.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice $450,000, which is significantly more than what the entire pot would be worth to her in the next round. This gives me a better share than her initial offer while still being generous enough that she should accept rather than move to another round where her share would be worth even less due to her higher inflation rate."
