0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob, since I’m facing a 10% per‐round devaluation while you aren’t, I know that if we wait you’ll be in an even stronger bargaining position. In light of the fact that your best alternative on your turn would net you the full $1000000 anyway, I’m proposing right now that you get the entire amount, and I take nothing, so we can avoid further losses on my end. I hope you find this deal acceptable and that we settle now!",Alice,1,
