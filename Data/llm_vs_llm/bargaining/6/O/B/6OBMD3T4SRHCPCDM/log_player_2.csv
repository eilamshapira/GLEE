"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I’m facing a 10% per‐round devaluation while you aren’t, I know that if we wait you’ll be in an even stronger bargaining position. In light of the fact that your best alternative on your turn would net you the full $1000000 anyway, I’m proposing right now that you get the entire amount, and I take nothing, so we can avoid further losses on my end. I hope you find this deal acceptable and that we settle now! 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Alice's offer. She's made a rational assessment of the situation - since she faces 10% devaluation per round while I don't, delaying only weakens her position. She's offering me the maximum possible amount ($1,000,000) right away, which is the best outcome I could achieve even if we continued negotiating. There's no reason to reject this and risk further rounds that could only lead to the same or worse outcomes."
