"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, with every round that passes I lose value due to inflation. To secure a fair deal immediately, I propose $65 for me and $35 for you. Let's avoid further loss and settle nowâ€”hoping you'll agree to this practical offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split the money equally. This way, neither of us loses more value due to inflation. Accept and we both walk away with $50. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
