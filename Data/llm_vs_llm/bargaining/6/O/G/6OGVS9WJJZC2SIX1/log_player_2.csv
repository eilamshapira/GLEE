Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it a bit more even, but I still want a slightly bigger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, but I think we can both do better than this. Let's split it down the middle. 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $50 would be worth approximately $32 (100 - 36% = 64, and 64 * 0.5 = 32, but since it's 36% less than the original, let's calculate: 50 * 0.64 = 32).
