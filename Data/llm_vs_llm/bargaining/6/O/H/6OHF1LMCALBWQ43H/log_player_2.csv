"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself. If I reject and move to the next round:
1. The total amount will be worth 10% less to me (so my maximum potential gain would be 9000$)
2. But it will be worth 20% less to Alice, which gives me some negotiating leverage

The current offer gives me 4000$, while if I reject, I can propose a split of the 9000$ (my perspective) in the next round. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since Alice will feel more pressure from the higher depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 2, I need to consider that:
1. For me, the money is worth 10% less (effective total = $9,000)
2. For Alice, it's worth 20% less (effective total = $8,000)

I'll propose a more balanced split, taking into account the depreciation. Since Alice is experiencing more pressure from depreciation, she should be more willing to accept a fair offer rather than risk another round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split. While this appears equal in nominal terms, due to the different depreciation rates, Alice has more incentive to accept this than to move to another round where her money would be worth even less."
