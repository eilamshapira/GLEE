"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, we're in Round 1, and if I reject, I can make my own offer in Round 2. The catch is that the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, but not to Alice.

Current value to me: $50
Value to me if we wait one round: $47.50 (5% less)

Since waiting will only decrease the value of money for me, and this is already a fair split, it makes sense to accept now.
