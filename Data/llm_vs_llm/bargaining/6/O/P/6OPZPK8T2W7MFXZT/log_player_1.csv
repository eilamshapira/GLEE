"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and you get a substantial amount without any back-and-forth.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a closer split. I'll take 48% and you get 52%. It's a smaller difference and we both still get a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offered me $520,000 (52%)
2. The money Bob would get ($480,000) is worth 5% less to him than in round 1
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease another 5%
4. This is actually a quite reasonable offer - I get more than half, and while I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value in further rounds

Given that this is a fair offer and I get the majority share without risking further negotiations, I'll accept.
