Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, knowing that Bob's money is worth 20% less than in the first round for him, and also knowing that he rejected an offer where he got $550,000 (worth $440,000 to him), I need to make an offer that's still highly favorable to me but tempting enough for him to accept. I'll adjust my offer slightly.

{
""alice_gain"": 950000,
""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation. Bob's money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round. This means $450,000 is worth $450,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $450,000 * 0.512 = $230,400 to him. I am still receiving the money at its original value, and I would get $550,000. Given the continued losses Bob is facing, I will accept this offer.
