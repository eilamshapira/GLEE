"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely unbalanced. Alice is offering me only 1% of the total amount, which is very unfavorable for me. Even with inflation concerns, this initial offer is too low to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I need to account for that in my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

My proposal is fair and balanced. I'm offering you a substantial portion while keeping slightly more for myself to offset the inflation effect I'm experiencing. This division allows both of us to walk away with a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's new offer is still very unbalanced. She's offering me only 5% of the total, which is $50,000, while taking $950,000 for herself. Even considering the inflation effect on my side, this is not a fair division.

The money is now worth 36% less to me than in round 1, but that doesn't justify such an imbalanced split. If we continue to the next round, the money will be worth even less to me due to inflation, but I need to push for a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation affecting me and the fact that we're now in round 4. The money is worth significantly less to me with each round, so I should aim for a reasonable compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a fair division that acknowledges the inflation affecting me. Since the money is losing value for me with each round but not for you, I'm willing to accept slightly less than half. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us and avoids further rounds where my share would lose even more value."
