"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I want to make a compelling offer while considering the rapid inflation.

Here's my initial offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split to start! Let's avoid losing value to inflation.""
}
```

**Explanation of my reasoning:**

*   **Alice gets more:** I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly (60/40 split). This is because, ideally, I want to maximize my earnings.
*   **Bob gets a significant amount:** I'm offering Bob a substantial $4000. This is high enough to be attractive, hopefully leading to an acceptance.
*   **Urgency in the Message:** I emphasized the importance of avoiding inflation. This can be a strong motivator for Bob to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a better split considering inflation impact. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. He's trying to exploit the inflation difference to his advantage. Let's analyze this.

**My Current Situation:**

*   My money is now worth 10% less.
*   Bob's money is worth 20% less.

**Bob's Offer:**

*   Alice: $7000
*   Bob: $3000

**Analysis:**

Bob is offering me $7000. While it seems like a large number, it's important to consider the current worth of money.

Let's compare the offers in terms of round 1 dollars, considering inflation.

*   Round 1, Alice offer to Alice: $6000
*   Round 2, Bob offer to Alice: $7000, after 10% inflation => $7000 * 0.9 = $6300

Bob's offer is more than my offer from round 1.
