0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob. In this first round, I’m offering you the entire $1000000. If you reject and wait until the next round, you’ll still be in the powerful position of proposing—meaning you’d be able to secure $1000000 anyway. Given there’s no monetary advantage for you to delay, I invite you to accept this offer now so we can conclude the game immediately.",Alice,1,
