"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic first offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value due to inflation (more severely for me than Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while securing a good outcome for myself, considering that my inflation penalty is higher if we go to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $36
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount will be worth 40% less for me and 20% less for Bob
- My best offer in round 3 would still likely face rejection, and the value would continue to decrease rapidly for me

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, considering the higher inflation rate I face and the risk of further devaluation, it's better to accept this offer now.
