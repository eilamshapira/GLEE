"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less
   - Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $90 (100 * 0.9)
   - But Alice might reject my proposal

Since $40 is a reasonable offer and I risk getting less due to inflation if I reject, I'll accept.
