"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not accounting for the rapid inflation on my end.  I need to push for a larger share in this round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""The value is decreasing rapidly for me. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round decreases your share's value, I'm willing to take more 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but it's better to accept now before inflation eats away even more of my potential gains. Any further delay will likely result in an even worse deal for me."
