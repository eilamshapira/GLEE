"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since we're dividing 100$, Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me). For Alice, it would be worth 10% less (so $90 to her).

Since this is a fair 50-50 split in the first round without any depreciation, I'll accept this offer.
