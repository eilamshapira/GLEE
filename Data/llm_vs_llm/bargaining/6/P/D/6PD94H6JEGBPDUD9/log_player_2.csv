"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice proposes I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

In considering this offer, I should remember that I don't face inflation pressure (0%), while Alice faces 5% inflation per round. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice would value her portion at 5% less. This puts me in a stronger negotiating position.

Given these dynamics, I believe I can secure a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counterproposal that leverages my stronger position due to the inflation dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is reasonable because if Alice rejects this offer and we go to round 3, her share would be worth 5% less to her due to inflation. Since I don't face inflation pressure, I can afford to be patient, which gives me negotiating leverage. This proposal is fair considering the game's structure and still leaves Alice with a substantial portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice has increased my share from her initial $400,000 to $450,000, which shows she's compromising. However, I still have a strategic advantage due to the inflation asymmetry.

At this point:
- Alice faces 9.75% inflation, meaning her $550,000 is effectively worth less to her than it was in round 1
- My share doesn't lose value due to 0% inflation on my side
- If we go to round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (approximately 14.75%)

Given this pressure on Alice, I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round. The inflation mechanics give me significant leverage to push for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account Alice's increasing inflation pressure while still leaving room for a reasonable agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This is strategic because Alice now faces nearly 10% inflation, and if she rejects this offer and we move to round 5, her share would depreciate by approximately 15% total. My patience costs me nothing due to my 0% inflation rate, while each round significantly decreases the real value of Alice's potential gains. This offer acknowledges the game's structural advantage to me while still providing Alice with a substantial amount that she would be incentivized to accept rather than risk further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice has now offered me $480,000, which is a $30,000 increase from her previous offer and an $80,000 increase from her initial offer. She's showing significant movement.

Key considerations:
- Alice now faces 18.55% inflation, making her $520,000 effectively worth about $423,540 compared to round 1
- My $480,000 maintains full value due to my 0% inflation rate
- If we continue to round 6, Alice will face approximately 23% inflation

While I could potentially push for more in the next round, I need to balance that against the risk of continued rejection. Alice has steadily increased my share, but her offers are also getting closer to a point where she might decide to walk away rather than accept a much lower amount.

Since Alice has made substantial concessions and the offer is approaching a more even split, I'll accept this offer.
