"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, and this is the third round, Bob's money is now worth 5% * 2 = 10% less than the original value for him (1 - 0.05)^2 = 0.9025 of the original value. However, for me, the value remains the same.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.
