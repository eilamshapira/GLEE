"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The total value will be worth 10% less to me (effectively $9000 for my portion)
   * I could propose a split, but Alice has no time pressure
   * Even if I propose 50/50 next round, I'd get $5000 * 0.9 = $4500

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the 10% inflation penalty makes this risky. The current offer of $4000 is not too far from what I might get in the next round after the penalty, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer.
