"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation that could reduce the total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair adjustment considering the value loss we're facing with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
   - Even if I propose a higher split in my favor, the inflation will eat into it significantly

Bob's offer isn't great, but waiting another round means even more value loss. $40.5 now is better than risking further depreciation.
