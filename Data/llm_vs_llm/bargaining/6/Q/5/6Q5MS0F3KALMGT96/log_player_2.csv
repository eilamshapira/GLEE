"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000, which is only 10% for me and 90% for her. 

Given that we have 12 rounds, and each round decreases the value by 10% for me due to inflation, I should consider both the fairness of the offer and the strategic implications of continuing.

This first offer seems quite unbalanced in Alice's favor. I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that we both need to be satisfied with the outcome and that I face 10% inflation per round.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. This gives us both equal shares of the money, which should be acceptable. While I understand we're in a negotiation, starting with an equitable division demonstrates good faith and a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $100,000 to $190,000, while still keeping a large portion for herself ($810,000). 

I need to consider this carefully:
1. We're now in round 3, and inflation has reduced the value of my potential gains by 19% compared to round 1
2. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where I'll face even more inflation (roughly 27.1% less than round 1)
3. Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by increasing my portion

While $190,000 is still much less than half, continuing to negotiate might result in diminishing returns for me due to inflation. However, I believe there's still room for a more equitable distribution, especially since we have many rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected my 50-50 split and we're progressing through rounds with inflation affecting my gains, I'll propose a new offer that acknowledges the negotiation dynamic while still seeking a fair outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This slight adjustment in my favor helps offset some of the inflation I face with each round. Given that Alice's previous offer was still heavily in her favor, this represents a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges both parties need to compromise to reach an agreement. The longer we negotiate, the more inflation will reduce the value for me, so finding an acceptable split sooner is in both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 271000 
# Alice gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me again, now to $271,000 (with $729,000 for herself). 

Let me analyze the situation:
1. We're now in round 5, with inflation reducing my potential gains by 34.39% compared to round 1
2. Alice has been gradually increasing my share ($100K → $190K → $271K)
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 6 with even more inflation
4. The $271,000 with 34.39% inflation is worth approximately $177,801 in round 1 value

While this offer is better than previous ones, it's still significantly below a fair split. However, with inflation continuing to reduce my potential gains, and considering we're already at round 5 of 12, I need to weigh the benefits of holding out for more versus accepting what's offered now.

I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 6 and my previous offers have been rejected, I need to be more strategic considering the inflation impact.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. While this may appear to favor me more than a 50-50 split, the actual value I receive is significantly reduced by inflation. With each passing round, my potential gains lose 10% more value, while Alice's offers have been consistently below an equitable division.

This offer acknowledges the time pressure I'm under due to inflation while still giving Alice a substantial portion. Considering that we're halfway through our negotiation window, finding an acceptable compromise becomes increasingly urgent for both of us to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 343900 
# Alice gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $343,900 for me (with $656,100 for herself).

Let me evaluate this carefully:
1. We're now in round 7, with inflation reducing my gains by 46.86% compared to round 1
2. The actual value of the $343,900 offer, accounting for inflation, is approximately $182,726 in round 1 terms
3. Alice has continued her pattern of gradual increases ($100K → $190K → $271K → $343.9K)
4. We have 5 rounds remaining, and inflation will continue to reduce my potential gains
5. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

While Alice's offer is still less than a 50-50 split, the continued inflation makes holding out increasingly risky for me. The gap between our positions has been narrowing, and given the inflation penalty I face, this offer is becoming more reasonable.

After careful consideration of the remaining rounds and inflation impact, I'll accept this offer.
