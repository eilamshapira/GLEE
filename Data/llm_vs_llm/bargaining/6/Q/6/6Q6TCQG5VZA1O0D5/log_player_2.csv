"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount of money.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (the money is worth 0% less each round for me), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could potentially give me negotiating leverage in later rounds.

Given that I can make my own proposal in the next round and have nothing to lose by continuing, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a division where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This gives me the majority share while still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, this might be appealing to her if she faces significant inflation penalties by continuing to another round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new situation carefully. 

Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $450,000 while she would get $550,000. I notice that the inflation is affecting Alice - her gains are now worth 19% less than in the first round, while my gains remain unaffected by inflation.

This reveals important strategic information: Alice is facing significant inflation penalties as rounds progress. If I reject this offer, Alice's position will likely worsen in the next round due to increasing inflation on her side.

Given this advantage, I'll reject this offer and make a more favorable counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I understand Alice faces significant inflation penalties (19% already by round 3), I have stronger negotiating leverage. Since the money becomes less valuable to her with each passing round, I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than face further inflation penalties.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing that I receive $650,000 and Alice receives $350,000. Given that Alice is losing value with each round due to inflation, accepting this offer now may be better for her than waiting for another round where her share would be worth even less."
