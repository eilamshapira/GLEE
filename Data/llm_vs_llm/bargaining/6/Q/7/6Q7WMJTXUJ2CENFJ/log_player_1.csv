"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer that respects the time pressure we both face due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 while I take $550,000. I propose this split because I face 20% inflation per round, so delaying will significantly decrease the value for me. Let's make a deal now that's beneficial for both of us rather than letting inflation erode our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that our offers are getting closer. Let's make a compromise to avoid further inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly even split - $500,000 each. This is fair for both of us, and given that inflation is affecting me more severely (20% per round) than it's affecting you (10% per round), it makes sense to reach an agreement now rather than continue negotiating and losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're both losing significant value due to inflation - I'm now at almost 50% less value, while Bob is at 27% less. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering Bob $520,000 while I take $480,000. This split recognizes that Bob has a lower inflation rate, but also acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement soon. With my higher inflation rate, continuing this negotiation will hurt me substantially more than Bob, but this offer represents a fair compromise given our circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
