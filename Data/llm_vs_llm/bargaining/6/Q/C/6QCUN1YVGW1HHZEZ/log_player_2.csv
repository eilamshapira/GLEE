"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I know that waiting could be risky
3. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
4. I could make a counter-offer in the next round
5. Since I know my money won't lose value, I can safely reject this and propose a more favorable split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split since I know I'm not affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55-45 split. This is fairer than your initial offer, and since we're both trying to reach an agreement, this seems reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is fair considering the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40
2. I know that Alice is facing inflation (19% loss in value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $45 maintains full value
4. If I reject, Alice's next offer might be even more favorable due to her increasing inflation pressure
5. However, this offer is reasonably fair, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a breakdown in cooperation

While I could potentially get a better deal by waiting, the current offer of $45 is reasonable and eliminates any risk.
