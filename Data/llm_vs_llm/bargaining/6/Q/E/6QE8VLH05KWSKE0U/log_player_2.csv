"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is $50 for each of us. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to account for the inflation effect. If I reject this offer and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me in round 2. 

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I'd need to ask for more than $50 to offset the inflation. However, there's risk in rejection as we might end up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

The current offer gives me a guaranteed $50, which is reasonable. Since this is the first round with no inflation penalty yet, and a 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
