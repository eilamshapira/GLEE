8999.0,1001.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a quick and fair settlement. I’m offering $8999 for me and $1001 for you. If you hold out until the next round, you’d become the proposer but could only expect about $1000 nominally – and with every delay my share loses 10% of its value. Accepting this offer now gives you a tiny bonus over your alternative while sparing us both the hassle of a devalued process. What do you say?",Alice,1,
