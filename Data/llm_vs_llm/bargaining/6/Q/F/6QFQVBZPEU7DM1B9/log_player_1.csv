"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8999, ""bob_gain"": 1001, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a quick and fair settlement. I’m offering $8,999 for me and $1,001 for you. If you hold out until the next round, you’d become the proposer but could only expect about $1,000 nominally – and with every delay my share loses 10% of its value. Accepting this offer now gives you a tiny bonus over your alternative while sparing us both the hassle of a devalued process. What do you say?""}"
