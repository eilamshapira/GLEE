510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob! Since you face a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This split is nearly even but gives us both incentive to accept early rather than letting inflation eat away our shares.",Alice,1,

490000.0,510000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation pressures, but I believe a slightly more equitable split is in order given the circumstances. How about we try this?",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's consider the math here. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly to inflation. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine at 5%. If we reach round 4, your 510000 would be worth only about 262000 in round 1 value, while my 490000 would still be worth about 420000. This 55/45 split accounts for our different inflation pressures and gives us both incentive to close this deal now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your points about inflation, but I believe a truly fair split is the best way to ensure we both walk away satisfied. A 50/50 split reflects that fairness and avoids any further losses for both of us.",Bob,4,
