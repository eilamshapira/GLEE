"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since you face a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This split is nearly even but gives us both incentive to accept early rather than letting inflation eat away our shares.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation pressures, but I believe a slightly more equitable split is in order given the circumstances. How about we try this? 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's consider the math here. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly to inflation. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine at 5%. If we reach round 4, your 510,000 would be worth only about 262,000 in round 1 value, while my 490,000 would still be worth about 420,000. This 55/45 split accounts for our different inflation pressures and gives us both incentive to close this deal now before we both lose more value.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your points about inflation, but I believe a truly fair split is the best way to ensure we both walk away satisfied. A 50/50 split reflects that fairness and avoids any further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
