"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since you face a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This split is nearly even but gives us both incentive to accept early rather than letting inflation eat away our shares. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the inflation pressures, but I believe a slightly more equitable split is in order given the circumstances. How about we try this?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's consider the math here. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly to inflation. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine at 5%. If we reach round 4, your 510000 would be worth only about 262000 in round 1 value, while my 490000 would still be worth about 420000. This 55/45 split accounts for our different inflation pressures and gives us both incentive to close this deal now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
