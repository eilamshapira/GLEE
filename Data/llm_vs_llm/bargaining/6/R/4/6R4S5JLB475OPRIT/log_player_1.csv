"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me while still being fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid the 10% loss from inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I offer a 55-45 split in my favor, as I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Since we're in round 2, the total value has decreased by 10%. So the real value of what I'm being offered is:

$45 Ã— 0.9 = $40.50

If I reject and we go to round 3, there will be another 10% decrease, making future negotiations even less valuable. Also, Bob's offer is quite reasonable - it's the same split I proposed but reversed.
