"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest that I take $55 and Bob takes $45, which is a reasonable split considering the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself to offset this disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced. Since we're now in Round 3, the inflation impact is becoming more significant. I'm proposing $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, which accounts for our different inflation rates while being more generous than my initial offer. This should be a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
