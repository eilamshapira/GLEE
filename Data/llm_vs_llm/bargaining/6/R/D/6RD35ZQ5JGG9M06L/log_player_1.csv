"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both parties a good share, but slightly favors me since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair proposal where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. It's a 55%-45% split which is reasonable considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $4,800 (no inflation impact for me)
   * Bob gets $5,200 (but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $4,160 for him)

2. If I reject:
   * We move to the next round where I can make another offer
   * But Bob's inflation will increase further
   * I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate
   * My money value stays the same

Since Bob's effective gain ($4,160) is less than what he would have gotten from my first offer ($4,500), and my offer would be worth even less to him in the next round, I think I can get a better deal by making another proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money is now affected by inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I need to consider that any amount I offer Bob is worth 20% less to him now, so I'll increase his nominal amount to make it more attractive while still maintaining a good position for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split. While this appears perfectly equal at $5,000 each, due to the 20% inflation on Bob's side, it effectively means:
- I get $5,000 (full value)
- Bob gets $5,000 (worth $4,000 to him due to 20% inflation)

This is actually a more generous offer to Bob than my previous one in terms of what he'll effectively receive, and the even split might appeal psychologically despite the inflation effect."
