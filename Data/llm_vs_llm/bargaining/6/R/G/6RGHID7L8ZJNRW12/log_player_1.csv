"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair, but gives me a slight advantage since I'm moving first. If Bob declines, the total value will decrease by 10% for me in the next round, so I need to account for that risk in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $360,000 to me

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But the money will be worth another 10% less to me
   * That means even if I got the full million in the next round, it would be worth only $810,000 to me
   * And Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

While this offer gives Bob more than me, rejecting it could lead to worse outcomes due to inflation. The current offer, though not ideal, gives me a guaranteed value that's still significant.
