600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face more severe inflation (20% vs your 5%), so I need a larger share now to offset my faster diminishing returns. Let's agree quickly and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face. However, that actually gives me the advantage in negotiations since waiting hurts you more than me. Still, I want us both to walk away with a good amount quickly. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair given our positions. If we delay further, your share will be worth even less due to your 20% inflation rate, while mine only faces 5% inflation. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Yes, I face higher inflation, which is precisely why I need a larger share to compensate for my faster value loss. If we continue rejecting offers, my inflation compounds more severely, but you also lose value. Let's be practical - this split is fair considering our differential inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,3,
