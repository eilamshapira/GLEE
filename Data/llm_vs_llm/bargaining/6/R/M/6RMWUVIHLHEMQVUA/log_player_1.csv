"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer to Bob for the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face more severe inflation (20% vs your 5%), so I need a larger share now to offset my faster diminishing returns. Let's agree quickly and both walk away with substantial amounts.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face. However, that actually gives me the advantage in negotiations since waiting hurts you more than me. Still, I want us both to walk away with a good amount quickly. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair given our positions. If we delay further, your share will be worth even less due to your 20% inflation rate, while mine only faces 5% inflation. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Yes, I face higher inflation, which is precisely why I need a larger share to compensate for my faster value loss. If we continue rejecting offers, my inflation compounds more severely, but you also lose value. Let's be practical - this split is fair considering our differential inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts.""
