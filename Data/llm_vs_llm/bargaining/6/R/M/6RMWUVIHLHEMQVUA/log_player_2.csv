"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face more severe inflation (20% vs your 5%), so I need a larger share now to offset my faster diminishing returns. Let's agree quickly and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while she takes $600,000 (60%). She justifies this by noting her higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%).

While she does face higher inflation, this actually means I should get more money now, not less. If we delay, her share loses value faster than mine, giving me more leverage in later rounds.

In round 1, I have maximum negotiating power since I can reject and make a counter-offer where Alice faces significant inflation pressure.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes advantage of our different inflation rates while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face. However, that actually gives me the advantage in negotiations since waiting hurts you more than me. Still, I want us both to walk away with a good amount quickly. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair given our positions. If we delay further, your share will be worth even less due to your 20% inflation rate, while mine only faces 5% inflation. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Yes, I face higher inflation, which is precisely why I need a larger share to compensate for my faster value loss. If we continue rejecting offers, my inflation compounds more severely, but you also lose value. Let's be practical - this split is fair considering our differential inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. 

Alice is now offering me $450,000 (45%) while she takes $550,000 (55%). This is an improvement from her initial 60-40 split.

Due to inflation, my $450,000 is worth about $406,125 in original value (9.75% less), while Alice's $550,000 is worth about $352,000 in original value (36% less).

If we continue to the next round, my inflation will reach about 14.5% while Alice's will reach about 49%. The diminishing returns are accelerating, especially for Alice.

Her offer is reasonable given our inflation rates, and continuing to negotiate risks significant value loss for both of us. I should secure a good amount now rather than risk further deterioration.
