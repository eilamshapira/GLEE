"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start with a reasonable split, considering the effect of inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the $10,000 equally - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that inflation is affecting both of us, with Bob experiencing even greater inflation than me. Let me propose a more strategic offer considering our inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering you a larger portion to account for your higher inflation rate. This gives you $5,500 while I take $4,500, which should be more appealing than an even split given our different inflation situations."
