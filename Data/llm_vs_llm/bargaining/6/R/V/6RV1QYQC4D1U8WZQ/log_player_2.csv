"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10%)
2. If I reject and move to next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
3. To beat this offer in the next round, I would need to propose more than $111,111 to compensate for inflation
4. While 10% is a small share, the absolute amount is still significant
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable proposal from me in the next round

However, given that:
- The starting amount is very large
- 10% is quite a small share considering we should be equal partners
- I can still make a profitable counter-offer even accounting for inflation
- Alice's justification for taking 90% isn't very compelling

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the fact that future rounds will be affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a substantial $400,000 while acknowledging that we both deserve a significant share. If you reject, remember that inflation will affect the next round.""}"
