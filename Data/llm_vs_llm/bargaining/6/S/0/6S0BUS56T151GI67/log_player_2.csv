"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk. I'm offering you $4500. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. In the next round, my maximum potential gain would be worth 20% less
4. $4500 is a decent offer, considering I could lose value in future rounds

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value due to inflation makes this a reasonable offer. It's not quite 50-50, but it's close enough given the inflation risk.
