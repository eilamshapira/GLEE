500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"Alice, I know the temptation to wait when you get to propose next round, but remember that each new round further erodes the value of the money for you—with a 20% drop per round. In round 3 you would face even harsher inflation, and the equilibrium outcome would leave you almost empty-handed. Accepting $10000 now (which, even discounted, is far better than the near‐zero you’d expect later) is the smarter, secure choice. Let’s settle this now and avoid any further losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm taking into account the inflation, but I still believe in a fair split. This offer is more in your favor, considering the situation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5—but remember that by then your money will only be worth about 0.4096 of its face value (a 59% loss compared to full value) rather than the current 0.512 value. By accepting this offer now, you secure $800000, which nets you an effective value of about $409600 – at least as good as what you can expect later, and with certainty. I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation dynamics and our remaining rounds. Let's settle now before further losses occur.",Bob,4,

300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is heavily affecting my potential gain, but I still believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the current value situation and is more in your favor, considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
802000.0,198000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer and wait until round 7, you will be the proposer—but your money will be worth only about 0.262 per dollar due to inflation, meaning even if you keep nearly everything, you'll end up with an effective value around $262000. In this offer, your $802000 translates into roughly $802000 × 0.32768 ≈ $262800 in effective value – a slight improvement over waiting. I believe this small gain now is worth locking in, rather than risking further losses. Let's settle this round and avoid additional depreciation.",Bob,6,
