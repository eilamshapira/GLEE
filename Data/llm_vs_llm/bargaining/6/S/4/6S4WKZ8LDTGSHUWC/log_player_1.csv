"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the temptation to wait when you get to propose next round, but remember that each new round further erodes the value of the money for you—with a 20% drop per round. In round 3 you would face even harsher inflation, and the equilibrium outcome would leave you almost empty-handed. Accepting $10000 now (which, even discounted, is far better than the near‐zero you’d expect later) is the smarter, secure choice. Let’s settle this now and avoid any further losses. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the 3rd round, the value of the money has decreased by 20% in the 2nd round and another 20% in this round, which is a total decrease of 36% (20% + 20% - (20% * 20%)) from the original value for me. However, I'll aim for a fair split considering the circumstances.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm taking into account the inflation, but I still believe in a fair split. This offer is more in your favor, considering the situation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5—but remember that by then your money will only be worth about 0.4096 of its face value (a 59% loss compared to full value) rather than the current 0.512 value. By accepting this offer now, you secure $800000, which nets you an effective value of about $409600 – at least as good as what you can expect later, and with certainty. I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation dynamics and our remaining rounds. Let's settle now before further losses occur. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth approximately 59.4% less than in the first round (20% decrease in round 2, 20% of the remaining 80% in round 3, and 20% of the remaining 64% in round 4). I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant decrease in value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation is heavily affecting my potential gain, but I still believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the current value situation and is more in your favor, considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer and wait until round 7, you will be the proposer—but your money will be worth only about 0.262 per dollar due to inflation, meaning even if you keep nearly everything, you'll end up with an effective value around $262000. In this offer, your $802000 translates into roughly $802000 × 0.32768 ≈ $262800 in effective value – a slight improvement over waiting. I believe this small gain now is worth locking in, rather than risking further losses. Let's settle this round and avoid additional depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 802000 
# Bob gain: 198000
