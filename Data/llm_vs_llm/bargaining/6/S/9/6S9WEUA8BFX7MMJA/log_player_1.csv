"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that considers the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a reasonable division that gives us both a significant portion. Since inflation affects you more quickly than me (10% vs 5% per round), accepting now would be in your best interest rather than prolonging negotiations and losing more value."
