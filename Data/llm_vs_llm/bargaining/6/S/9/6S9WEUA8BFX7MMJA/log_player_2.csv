"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalty for rejecting.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. This means in the next round, we're effectively dividing $90 from my perspective.

Alice's current offer gives me $45, which is less than half but still a significant amount. If I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for me vs 5% for Alice), delaying puts me at a disadvantage, as each round diminishes my potential gain more than hers.
