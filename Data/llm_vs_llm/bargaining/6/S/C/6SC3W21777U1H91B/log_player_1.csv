"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since waiting costs you 20% in value, this $45 is actually worth more to you now than $60 would be next round. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
