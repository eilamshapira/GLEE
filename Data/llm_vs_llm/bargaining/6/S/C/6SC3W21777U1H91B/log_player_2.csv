"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you get 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round
4. That means in the next round, $60 will only be worth $48 to her
5. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and offering something that takes advantage of this inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation, I can use this to negotiate a better deal. Her $60 from last round would only be worth $48 to her now, so I can offer her a bit more in absolute terms while actually giving her less value.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since waiting costs you 20% in value, this $45 is actually worth more to you now than $60 would be next round. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""}"
