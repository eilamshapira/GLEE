550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm offering you $450000 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we keep going to further rounds, we'll both lose value - you'll lose 20% each round while I lose 10%. This deal gives us both substantial money without risking further devaluation. Let's conclude this now for mutual benefit.",Alice,1,
