"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you $450000 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we keep going to further rounds, we'll both lose value - you'll lose 20% each round while I lose 10%. This deal gives us both substantial money without risking further devaluation. Let's conclude this now for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Alice's offer from Bob's perspective, considering the inflation factor.

*   **Current value:** \$450,000
*   **If rejected:** Bob makes a proposal in the next round.

If I reject this offer, I have to make a proposal in the next round. If Alice accepts my offer in the next round (round 2), the value of the money for me will be 20% less than what it is worth now.

Let's calculate the break-even point for me. If I reject this offer, and I want to have the equivalent of 450000 in the next round, after the inflation.

x * (1-0.20) = 450000
x = 450000 / 0.8
x = 562500

This means, that if I reject the offer now, I will need to propose Alice an offer in which I take at least 562500 so that after the 20% inflation, I end up with 450000. This also means that Alice will get 1000000 - 562500 = 437500. From Alice's perspective, this value will be affected by her 10% inflation rate, meaning that 437500 now is equivalent to 437500 * 0.9 = 393750.

I would be better off accepting the offer right now.
