"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface. However, if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. 

If I reject now, I'll be making the next proposal, but on $80 of effective value (for me). Even if I proposed to take all $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $80 to me due to inflation.

The current offer gives me $50, which is better than the maximum I could effectively get in the next round if inflation affects the whole amount.
