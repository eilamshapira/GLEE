"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation affects me more than you, but your initial offer was too imbalanced. This is a more fair division that still gives you the majority share. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing everything, and you also face inflation penalties each round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
