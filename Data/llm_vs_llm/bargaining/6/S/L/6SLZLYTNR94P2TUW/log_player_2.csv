"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, I'll take a bigger share but you'll still get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options here. Alice's offer gives me only $1,000 of the $10,000 total, which is quite unbalanced. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I'll be facing a 20% inflation penalty while Alice only faces a 5% penalty.

Given the significant inflation difference (20% vs 5%), waiting too many rounds will hurt me more than Alice. However, getting only 10% of the total amount seems unfair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation penalties while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation affects me more than you, but your initial offer was too imbalanced. This is a more fair division that still gives you the majority share. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing everything, and you also face inflation penalties each round.""}"
