"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains. I want to establish a cooperative tone while ensuring a fair share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'd like to propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55%-45%, which I think is fair as an opening offer. This gives me a small advantage while still offering Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, the next round's inflation will reduce the real value of my share by 20%, so I hope we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer, taking into account the inflation effect:

* If I accept now, I'll get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
* The inflation puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations, as Bob's value doesn't decrease
* $3600 real value is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds

Given these factors, while the split isn't ideal, the inflation pressure makes accepting now better than continuing negotiations where my position will only weaken.
