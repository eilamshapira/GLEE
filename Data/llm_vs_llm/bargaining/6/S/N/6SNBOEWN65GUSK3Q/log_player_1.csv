"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation and the limited number of rounds. I'll make a fair offer that hopefully Bob will accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think strategically. Bob's offer is a straight 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, and that I would be the one making the offer next round, and that my money will be worth 10% less again, it might be wise to accept this.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
