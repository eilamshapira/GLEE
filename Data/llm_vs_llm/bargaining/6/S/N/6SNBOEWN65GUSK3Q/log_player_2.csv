"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4500 out of the $10,000, which is 45% of the total. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on whatever amount I end up with. This means I'd need to secure about $5625 in the next round to be equivalent to the $4500 now.

Given that I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject, but considering the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation further reducing value, this isn't a terrible initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, and it's better for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to the inflation effect."
