550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round. This split gives us both a substantial amount, and we can finish the game immediately without any value loss due to inflation.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a split where I get 550000$ and you get 450000$. This way, we can end the game now and minimize the impact of inflation on my side. What do you think?",Bob,2,
