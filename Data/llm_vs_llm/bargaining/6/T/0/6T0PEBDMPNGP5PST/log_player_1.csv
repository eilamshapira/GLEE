"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer a fair split considering the inflation risk I face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round. This split gives us both a substantial amount, and we can finish the game immediately without any value loss due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a split where I get 550000$ and you get 450000$. This way, we can end the game now and minimize the impact of inflation on my side. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
