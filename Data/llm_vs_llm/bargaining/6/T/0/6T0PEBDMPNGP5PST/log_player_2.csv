"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round. This split gives us both a substantial amount, and we can finish the game immediately without any value loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
