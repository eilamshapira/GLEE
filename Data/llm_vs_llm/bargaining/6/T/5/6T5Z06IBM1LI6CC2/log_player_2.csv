"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally to save time. Given the 20% inflation per round for me, it's in our mutual interest to agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is to split the money equally, which is a fair proposal, and considering that I don't know the inflation rate for Alice but she mentioned it's 20% for her, it's reasonable to accept the offer to avoid potential losses due to inflation for both of us.
