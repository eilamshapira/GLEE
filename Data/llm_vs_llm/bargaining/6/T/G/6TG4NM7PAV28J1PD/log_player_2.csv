"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $4,737 while taking $5,263 for herself. This is close to a 47/53 split. 

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning any amount will be worth 20% less to me. If I make a counter-offer of, say, $5,000 for myself, that would be worth only $4,000 to me after inflation.

The $4,737 Alice is offering now is actually better than what I might get after inflation in the next round, even with a more favorable nominal split.
