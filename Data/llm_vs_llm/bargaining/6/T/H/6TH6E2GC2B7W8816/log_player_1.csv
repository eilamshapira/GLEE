"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split where we both get $500000. This is equitable and allows us both to walk away with significant value. With inflation affecting the total each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
