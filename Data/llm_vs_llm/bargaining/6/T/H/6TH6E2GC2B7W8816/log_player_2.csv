"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it decently; I'll take 600k and you take 400k. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I take 400,000$ while she takes 600,000$.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the entire 1,000,000$ would only be worth 900,000$ to me in the next round.

Let me evaluate:
- Current offer: I get 400,000$
- If I reject and propose a better split next round, the maximum I could get (even if I somehow got the entire amount) would be 900,000$

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, I need to be strategic. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, I should consider accepting reasonable offers early.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split where we both get $500,000. This is equitable and allows us both to walk away with significant value. With inflation affecting the total each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon.""}"
