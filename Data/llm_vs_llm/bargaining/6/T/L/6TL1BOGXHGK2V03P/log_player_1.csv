"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm suggesting an even 50-50 split so that we both can benefit equally. This seems fair and straightforward, especially considering the inflation factor. Let's make the most out of the full amount without losing any more value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I accept Bob's offer for an even 50-50 split. This is a fair proposal, and with the 5% inflation already affecting the value, it's better to agree now rather than risk further depreciation of the money in subsequent rounds."
