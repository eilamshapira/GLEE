"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm proposing an alternative split where I receive 55% and you receive 45%. Let's both walk away with a fair and substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 (worth full value to me)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (but worth 20% less to him, so effectively $440,000 for him)

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * But Bob's portion will be worth even less to him due to inflation
   * This means I might have more negotiating power in the next round

Since Bob's money is already devalued by 20%, this offer actually gives me the larger effective share. It's a decent deal for me, and there's risk in continuing negotiations.
