I'm starting with a 60/40 split, giving myself a slightly larger share. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This time I'm offering a 50/50 split. I think it's a fair and reasonable offer.  Let's see if Bob will accept."
