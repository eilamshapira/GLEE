Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I lose more to inflation each round (10% vs your 5%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact, I've made a slightly more balanced offer. Your loss is greater each round, but I'm also not gaining by waiting. Let's settle on this to minimize our combined loss. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
