"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I lose more to inflation each round (10% vs your 5%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
