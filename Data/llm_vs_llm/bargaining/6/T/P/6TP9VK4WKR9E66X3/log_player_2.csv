"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to ensure we reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so inflation hasn't kicked in yet
2. A 4000/6000 split is not particularly fair
3. With inflation reducing my share by 10% each round, I still have some rounds to negotiate
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. 4000$ is less than what I should reasonably expect from a fair division

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but acknowledge the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is fair and helps us reach a quick agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. My offer is still favorable considering the inflation you're facing. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 19% inflation, if I accept now:
   * My actual gain would be 4500 * 0.81 = 3645$ in round 1 value
2. Alice has increased her offer from 4000 to 4500, but not enough to compensate for inflation
3. We still have 9 rounds left
4. However, each round makes my position worse due to inflation
5. The offer is still not great, but waiting could make things worse

Given that my position weakens with each round due to inflation while Alice's doesn't, and she knows this, she might not improve her offer significantly.
