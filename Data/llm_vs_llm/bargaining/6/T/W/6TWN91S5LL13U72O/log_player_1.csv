"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100, considering the inflation rates for each of us.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair starting offer. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I should try to secure a reasonable amount early. This gives Bob a substantial portion while also accounting for my greater urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given our inflation rates and the rejected offers so far, I'll adjust my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm moving closer to Bob's 50-50 offer, but still accounting for my higher inflation rate. With my inflation at 20% per round compared to Bob's 5%, reaching an agreement sooner is more beneficial for me. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my initial proposal while still providing me with slightly more to offset my higher inflation rate."
