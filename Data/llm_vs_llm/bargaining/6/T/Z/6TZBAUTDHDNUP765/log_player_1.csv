"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer to divide the $10,000.

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for me, I should aim for a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This seems equitable and gives us both an equal share of the money. I believe a fair division gives us the best chance to conclude the negotiation in this first round, avoiding any inflation penalties for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Bob is offering me $4000 while taking $6000 for himself.

Given the inflation effects, if I accept now:
- My $4000 is worth 10% less than in round 1, so effectively worth $3600 to me
- Bob's $6000 is worth 20% less than in round 1, so effectively worth $4800 to him

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, my money would be worth 20% less than round 1. Any amount I might reasonably counter with would be significantly devalued.

Since Bob's inflation penalty is higher than mine, and the split isn't terribly unfair, accepting now seems better than continuing to negotiate with increasing inflation.
