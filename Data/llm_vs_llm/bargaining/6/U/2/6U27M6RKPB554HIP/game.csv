600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I propose that I take $600000 and you take $400000. This way, both of us get a substantial amount to begin with. Let's settle this round and maximize our gains!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
285714.0,714286.0,"Alice, in light of the depreciation we both face—my money losing 10% value per round and yours 20%—waiting further is costly. This offer ensures you receive the same real‐value you'd expect if you became proposer next round. I’m proposing that I take $714286 and you receive $285714. Accepting now locks in your share at a fair continuation value for you. Let's settle and both maximize our returns!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hey Bob, let's keep it simple and fair. We each take $500000. This way, both of us maximize our gains without facing further depreciation. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
285714.0,714286.0,"Alice, as you know, waiting costs us dearly: in this round my gains are at 72.9% of round‐one value and yours at 51.2%. If you reject, you'll become proposer in round 5, where you'll secure (by our usual alternating-offers logic) 357143 nominal dollars—but valued at 40.96% (i.e. about $146285 in today’s terms). My offer of $285714 for you in round 4 also gives you roughly $146285 in real value. This division is the equilibrium share when I’m the proposer, ensuring you get exactly what waiting would yield while sparing us further depreciation. I hope you accept this fair, time‐sensitive proposal.",Bob,4,
