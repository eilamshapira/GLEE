Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in light of the depreciation we both face—my money losing 10% value per round and yours 20%—waiting further is costly. This offer ensures you receive the same real‐value you'd expect if you became proposer next round. I’m proposing that I take $714286 and you receive $285714. Accepting now locks in your share at a fair continuation value for you. Let's settle and both maximize our returns! 
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as you know, waiting costs us dearly: in this round my gains are at 72.9% of round‐one value and yours at 51.2%. If you reject, you'll become proposer in round 5, where you'll secure (by our usual alternating-offers logic) 357143 nominal dollars—but valued at 40.96% (i.e. about $146285 in today’s terms). My offer of $285714 for you in round 4 also gives you roughly $146285 in real value. This division is the equilibrium share when I’m the proposer, ensuring you get exactly what waiting would yield while sparing us further depreciation. I hope you accept this fair, time‐sensitive proposal. 
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286
