"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose that I take $600000 and you take $400000. This way, both of us get a substantial amount to begin with. Let's settle this round and maximize our gains! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Alice, in light of the depreciation we both face—my money losing 10% value per round and yours 20%—waiting further is costly. This offer ensures you receive the same real‐value you'd expect if you became proposer next round. I’m proposing that I take $714,286 and you receive $285,714. Accepting now locks in your share at a fair continuation value for you. Let's settle and both maximize our returns!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep it simple and fair. We each take $500000. This way, both of us maximize our gains without facing further depreciation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Alice, as you know, waiting costs us dearly: in this round my gains are at 72.9% of round‐one value and yours at 51.2%. If you reject, you'll become proposer in round 5, where you'll secure (by our usual alternating-offers logic) 357143 nominal dollars—but valued at 40.96% (i.e. about $146285 in today’s terms). My offer of $285714 for you in round 4 also gives you roughly $146285 in real value. This division is the equilibrium share when I’m the proposer, ensuring you get exactly what waiting would yield while sparing us further depreciation. I hope you accept this fair, time‐sensitive proposal.""}"
