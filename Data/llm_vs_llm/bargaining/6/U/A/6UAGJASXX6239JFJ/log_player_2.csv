"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution, especially since inflation affects me by 20% per round, but its effect on Alice is unknown. Let me see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and we should keep in mind that inflation affects me by 20% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
