"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the game considering the 20% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I suggest an even split of the $1,000,000. This is fair and ensures we both get equal value. With inflation reducing the money's worth by 20% each round, it's best to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives us both significant value without wasting time on back-and-forth proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a revised offer considering our previous exchanges and the increasing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering a slightly adjusted split that gives Bob a bit more while still being fair to both of us. With the money now worth 40% less than the initial amount due to inflation, we should reach an agreement soon. This compromise acknowledges Bob's desire for a larger share while ensuring I receive a reasonable portion as well. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further devaluation of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the significant inflation we've already experienced.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

With the money now worth nearly 60% less than the initial amount due to compounding inflation, we need to reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering Bob a clear majority share at 55% while ensuring I still receive a reasonable portion. This is a significant compromise from my initial 50-50 split, acknowledging Bob's desire for a larger share. Further delays will substantially reduce the value for both of us, so I hope we can finalize this fair division now."
