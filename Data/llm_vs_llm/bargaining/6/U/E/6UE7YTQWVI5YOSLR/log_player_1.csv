"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Let's start with an even split. This is a fair offer and it would be good to set a cooperative tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer would give me 4500, which is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation. That means it's actually worth 4050 to me. I can probably do better if I make the next offer. So I will reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Considering the inflation rate of 10% for me and 20% for Bob, this offer would be actually worth 4950 to me and 3600 to Bob.
This offer gives Bob more than what he offered me in the previous round (worth 3600 vs 3300), so it's still fair, and a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer would be worth 2916 to me due to inflation. I think I can still make a better offer for both of us in the next round. So I will reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

Taking into account the current inflation rates (27.1% for me and 48.8% for Bob), this offer would be worth 4225.6 to me and 2150.4 to Bob.
This offer gives Bob 600 more than his last offer in real value, but I'm still gaining more than Bob."
