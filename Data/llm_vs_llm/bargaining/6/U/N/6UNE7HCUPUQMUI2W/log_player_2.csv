"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000.

If I reject this offer, I get to make a counteroffer in Round 2, but due to the 10% inflation penalty for me (but not for Alice), the total value will only be worth $900,000 to me.

Since my goal is to maximize my outcome, let me calculate:
- Current offer: $400,000 for me
- If I reject, I can propose a split of the effectively $900,000 (to me) in the next round

I think I can propose a better split for myself in the next round, even with the 10% penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer now for Round 2.

Since I have a 10% inflation penalty each round, I need to balance getting a good deal with the risk of further devaluation if we continue negotiating.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a better outcome than Alice's initial offer while being fair enough that she might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, which is fair to both of us. This gives me $100,000 more than Alice's initial offer, and we can both walk away with half of the total amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing.

Alice's new offer gives me $390,000, which is slightly less than her initial offer of $400,000. Meanwhile, she's taking $610,000.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to Round 4, where I can make a counteroffer. However, at that point, I'll face a 27.1% inflation penalty (compounded 10% three times), meaning the million dollars will only be worth about $729,000 to me.

Let me consider:
- Current offer: $390,000 for me
- My initial offer of $500,000 was rejected
- The inflation penalty is increasing with each round
- Alice knows she has a strategic advantage due to the asymmetric inflation

Given that Alice only slightly decreased her offer despite her advantage, and considering the accelerating inflation penalty I face, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds.
