"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer in this negotiation game. 

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair starting offer that gives us both a significant portion, while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is facing even higher inflation pressure than I am. Let me make a more equitable offer considering our different inflation rates.

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both of our inflation concerns while still giving us each a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
