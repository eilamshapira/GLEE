"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end the game 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While it's a substantial amount, it's not an equal split, and as the game will continue with me making the next offer if I reject, I believe I can achieve a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

""bob_gain"": 500000,
