"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs Bob's 10%). Since my money loses value faster, I should aim for a favorable split in the early rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, in the next round my potential gains will be worth 20% less
3. The offer to Bob is substantial enough to make accepting more attractive than risking future rounds where their money also loses value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $360,000 to me (450000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount will be worth another 20% less
3. If we continue going back and forth, we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds
4. Bob's portion ($550,000) is worth $495,000 to them after their 10% inflation

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, the decreasing value of money makes accepting now better than risking further rounds. The difference in our inflation rates means waiting will hurt me more than Bob.
