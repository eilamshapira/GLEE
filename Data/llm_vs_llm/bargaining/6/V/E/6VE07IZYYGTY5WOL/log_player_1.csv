I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I want to maximize my gain in the first round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced split this time, hoping to find a compromise.  Inflation is a factor, but I don't want to risk going too low and ending up with a worse deal in the future."
