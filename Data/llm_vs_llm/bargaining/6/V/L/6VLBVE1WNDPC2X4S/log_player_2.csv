"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth:
   - For me: 95% of value next round
   - For Alice: 90% of value next round
3. This means in the next round, I'll be dividing:
   - For me: $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500 total value
   - For Alice: $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000 total value

Since Alice is facing a steeper depreciation, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. The current offer of $4000 (40%) seems too low given this dynamic. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that money is now worth less to both of us (95% for me, 90% for Alice), and I need to make an offer that Alice would accept rather than reject and counter, I'll propose a more balanced split but still in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning:
1. If Alice rejects, the next round's money will be worth even less to her (81% of original value)
2. This offer gives her $4500 now, which is better than potentially getting less in a future round
3. It's a fair improvement from the initial 40-60 split she proposed
4. The offer is reasonable enough that rejecting it would likely result in a worse outcome for both of us due to depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. With inflation:
   - My $5000 is worth $5000 * 0.9025 = $4512.50 in original value
   - Alice's $5000 is worth $5000 * 0.81 = $4050 in original value

3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 85.74% for me (another 5% less)
   - Next round money will be worth 72.9% for Alice (another 10% less)

This is actually a decent offer considering:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. The inflation is hurting both of us
3. Further negotiations would reduce the real value significantly
4. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (60-40 split)
