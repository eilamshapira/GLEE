"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. The difference isn't so large that it should offend Bob, and it acknowledges the value of making the first move while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Due to 20% inflation on Bob's side, if we split $10,000 equally (5000/5000):
- I would get $5000 (full value)
- Bob would effectively get $4000 (due to 20% inflation)

This means that while the nominal split appears equal (50-50), in real value terms it's actually more favorable for me (I get $5000 in real value while Bob gets $4000 in real value). This is better than my initial offer in terms of real value distribution.

Given this analysis and considering we still have many rounds left but inflation is increasing, I should accept this offer.
