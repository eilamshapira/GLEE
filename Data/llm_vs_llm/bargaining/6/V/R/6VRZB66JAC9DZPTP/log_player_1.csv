"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I made the first move and took initiative in starting the negotiations.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Inflation is hurting me, and this offer reflects the decreased value of the money to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than round 1
- Even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would be worth $48 after the 20% inflation
- Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $40.5 to me) is not great, but waiting might be risky
