"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is a very unfair offer where Alice takes 99% of the money. Since this is the first round, and even with 5% inflation per round, I can make a counter-offer that would be much more favorable. I'll reject and make a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Rationale (not shown to human): I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is both fair and reasonable. While I could try to get more for myself, a fair split is more likely to be accepted by Alice. Even with the 5% inflation effect, this would still be much better than accepting Alice's initial low-ball offer. If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating, but at least I've established a reasonable starting point."
