"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34.48, ""bob_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any further loss in value for both of us, I’m proposing a division that takes our discount rates into account. Since every round costs me 10% in value and you only 5%, the fair‐balance in an alternating-offers setup suggests I’d get about $34.48 while you’d receive about $65.52. I believe this split reflects what we’d each expect if we were to bargain further, so let’s settle now.""}"
