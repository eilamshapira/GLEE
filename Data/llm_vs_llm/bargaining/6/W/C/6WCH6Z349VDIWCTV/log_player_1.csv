"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll consider what would be a fair proposal for dividing $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that each round makes the money worth 5% less to me but doesn't affect Bob's value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's important to reach an agreement in the first round to avoid the 5% inflation penalty I would face. While an even 50-50 split might seem immediately fair, my slight advantage in this proposal acknowledges that I'm under more time pressure than Bob. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob should find acceptable rather than rejecting and facing the uncertainty of further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for significantly more than a fair split while I'm already facing inflation pressure. We can try to reach a more balanced agreement in the next round, even with the additional 5% inflation I'll face."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a more strategic offer now, considering that the money is already worth 10% less to me due to inflation (5% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which is the most fair division. Even though I'm facing inflation penalties, continuing to negotiate for a larger share might lead to more rounds and greater losses for me. This balanced offer demonstrates good faith and should be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is now asking for an even larger share (65%) while I'm facing increasing inflation pressure. While I understand the time pressure is on my side, this division is too imbalanced to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation now making the money worth approximately 19% less to me (after 4 rounds of 5% compounding inflation), I need to make a more pragmatic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slight advantage at 55%, while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself. Further rounds of negotiation will significantly reduce the value of my share due to inflation, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer acknowledges Bob's stronger position due to the inflation mechanics while still seeking a relatively fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as Bob continues to demand an increasingly unfair division (70-30). Even with the inflation penalty I'm facing, accepting such an imbalanced offer would be worse than making a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation now making my money worth approximately 26.5% less (after 6 rounds of compounding 5% inflation), I need to make a more conciliatory offer to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob a 60% share now, recognizing that the continued inflation is significantly reducing the value of any future settlement for me. This offer matches what Bob proposed in round 2, showing I'm willing to accept terms that I previously rejected, due to the changing economic reality of the situation. The inflation mechanics strongly favor Bob in extended negotiations, so I'm hoping to conclude the game with this reasonable compromise."
