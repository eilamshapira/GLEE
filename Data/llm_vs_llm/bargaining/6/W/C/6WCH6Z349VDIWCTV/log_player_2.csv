Alice should consider that if she rejects this offer, we'll move to round 3 where her share will be worth 5% less due to inflation. While my money doesn't lose value, hers will continue to depreciate with each round. This is a fair offer given the inflation dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm adjusting my offer based on our negotiation dynamics. Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money is worth 14.26% less than in round 1 due to inflation. If she rejects this offer and we continue to round 5, her money will depreciate even further. This offer acknowledges the time pressure she faces while still allowing her to receive a meaningful portion of the money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30}

Given that we're now in round 6, Alice's money has depreciated by 22.62% from the original value. If we continue to round 7, her share will be worth even less due to the 5% compounding inflation she faces each round. This offer accounts for the significant time pressure on Alice while still allowing her to receive $30. It would be rational for her to accept this offer rather than continuing negotiations and facing further depreciation of her share."

Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
