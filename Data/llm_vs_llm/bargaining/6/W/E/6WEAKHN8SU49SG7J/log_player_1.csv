Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find something a bit more balanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? Let's settle this before inflation hurts us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
