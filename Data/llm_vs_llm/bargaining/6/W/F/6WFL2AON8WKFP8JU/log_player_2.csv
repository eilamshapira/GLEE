"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the total value will be reduced by 10% due to inflation (so we'd be dividing $90 in effective value for me).

If I reject and propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, reducing the overall value even more.

Given that $40 now is better than potentially less later due to inflation, and considering this is a reasonably fair offer:
