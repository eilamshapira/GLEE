"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value for me was $10,000. Now, it's worth $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.
For Alice, the total value was $10,000. Now, it's worth $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

Considering this, I'll make my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering inflation.

For me, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * (0.95)^2 = $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9,025.
Alice's offer of $4,200 would be $4,200 / $9,025 = approximately 46.5% of the total value.

For Alice, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * (0.8)^2 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400.
Alice's offer of $5,800 for herself would be $5,800 / $6,400 = approximately 90.6% of the total value, but she's offering me $4,200, which is a significant portion of the remaining value.

Considering this, I'll make my decision.
