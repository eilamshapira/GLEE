"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 for each of us), I need to carefully consider.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I were to propose a better split for myself in the next round (say 60-40), I'd get $600,000, but after accounting for the 5% inflation, that would be worth $570,000 to me - which is better than the current $500,000 offer.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, potentially leaving me worse off.

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now guarantees me $500,000 without risking further inflation.
