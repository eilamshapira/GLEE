"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only $10 out of $100, which seems quite unfair. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, I need to consider that due to inflation, the total value will be 5% less for me in the next round.

Let me make a strategic decision based on what would be more beneficial.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more equitable offer while accounting for the inflation impact on my end.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's fair to both of us. While a 50-50 split might seem most equitable, I'm accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. If we continue to negotiate, the total value decreases for me but not for Alice, so reaching an agreement now benefits both of us. This offer gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to receive a fair share as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer from $10 to $30, which is a significant improvement but still gives her a much larger share. I need to consider the inflation factor carefully now.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face approximately 15% inflation on my share. Given that Alice has moved substantially from her initial position, and the increasing inflation penalty I face, I should evaluate whether continuing is beneficial.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 4, I need to account for the compounding inflation effect on my share. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Alice while still maintaining a reasonable position for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the $100. This is a fair compromise that gives us both equal shares. Consider that with each round of rejection, the money becomes less valuable for me due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you. A 50-50 split represents a balanced solution that respects both our interests and avoids further depreciation of value through continued negotiation."
