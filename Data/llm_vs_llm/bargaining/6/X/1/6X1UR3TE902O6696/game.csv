60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering future rounds will be affected by inflation. Let's avoid losing value on the money and finish this in round one!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Since we're moving to the next round, I'm taking into account the potential inflation effect. I'm offering a more balanced split, considering the value might decrease for one of us. Let's settle this before it's too late!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a more balanced split, but my money is losing value. I'll offer 55/45. Let's end this now before my portion is worth even less. This is still a good deal for you!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the inflation effect on your side, I'm willing to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Since your money is losing value, I think this split is reasonable. Let's settle this before the value decreases further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, the inflation is really hurting me now. I'll offer a 50/50 split. This is the most reasonable offer I can make at this point, and it's still worth something to me. Let's just be done with this and both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
