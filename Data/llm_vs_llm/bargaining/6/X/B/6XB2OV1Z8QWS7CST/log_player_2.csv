"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is offering me the entire $10,000, leaving nothing for herself. While this is extremely favorable for me, I should consider:

1. This is round 1
2. The money loses 20% value for Alice each round, but maintains its value for me
3. Alice might be testing me or expecting me to reject out of fairness

However, this is actually the best possible outcome I could get, and there's no strategic advantage in rejecting it. Even if I make a counter-offer, I can't get more than $10,000, and Alice might reject my next proposal.
