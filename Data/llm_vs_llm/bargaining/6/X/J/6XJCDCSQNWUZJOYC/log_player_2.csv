"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $35 while she gets $65 out of the total $100.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me (making $100 worth $90 to me), but 20% less to Alice (making $100 worth $80 to her). This gives me some leverage.

In round 2, I could propose a more favorable split like $50 for me and $50 for Alice. Even with the 10% devaluation, I'd get $45 worth of value, which is better than the $35 I'm offered now.

Since I can improve my position by making a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer for round 2, considering that money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice compared to round 1.

Since Alice now values the $100 at only $80 (due to 20% devaluation), and I value it at $90 (due to 10% devaluation), I'll propose a split that gives both of us more value than we would have received by accepting Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money evenly - $50 for me and $50 for Alice. This is fair and gives Alice $50, which is worth $40 to her after the 20% devaluation. This is still more valuable than the $52 value (65 × 0.8) she would get if we went to round 3. For me, $50 is worth $45 after devaluation, which is significantly better than the $35 I was offered in round 1."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100. Due to inflation, this $45 is worth 19% less than in round 1, so the actual value to me is $45 × 0.81 = $36.45.

If I reject and move to round 4, the money will be worth even less - likely 27% less than round 1 for me (10% more than the current 19%), and 48% less for Alice (12% more than the current 36%).

If I went to round 4, I could propose a better split, but the continued devaluation means I'd need to get significantly more dollars to increase my real value. Also, Alice might reject again, leading to further rounds and more devaluation.

The $45 offer (worth $36.45 to me) is better than the initial $35 offer from round 1, and given the increasing devaluation, I should accept this offer.
