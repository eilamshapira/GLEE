"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer won't be as appealing later. 
# Bob gain: 80000 
# Alice gain: 920000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! While I lose money to inflation in later rounds, I'm sure we can reach a fairer agreement.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,

""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. A 60/40 split reflects that this is a time-sensitive negotiation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. Take this offer before it depreciates further for you. 
# Bob gain: 130000 
# Alice gain: 870000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but that's still a bad deal!  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a lopsided agreement."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a significant amount. Don't let greed get the best of you.  This deal benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 180000 
# Alice gain: 820000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer is slightly better, it's still far from what I consider fair.  Alice is trying to use psychological tactics, but I won't be swayed that easily."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. Your potential gain decreases with every passing round. 
# Bob gain: 230000 
# Alice gain: 770000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, as it's clear Alice is playing hardball.  However, that offer is simply too low. I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more reasonable in the next round rather than risk us both getting nothing."
