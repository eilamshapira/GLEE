"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! 50/50 split 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options carefully. While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money would be worth 10% less to me. If I were to then ask for 60/40 in my favor, I'd get 60 dollars but it would be worth only 54 (60 * 0.9) to me due to inflation. Alice would likely reject this.

The 50/50 split gives me 50 dollars now at full value, which is better than risking further rounds with compounding inflation penalties.
