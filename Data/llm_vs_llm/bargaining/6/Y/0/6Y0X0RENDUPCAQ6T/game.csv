500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We'd each get $500000, which is a substantial amount for both of us. Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty with each round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly, and I hope you'll find this balanced proposal acceptable.",Bob,2,
