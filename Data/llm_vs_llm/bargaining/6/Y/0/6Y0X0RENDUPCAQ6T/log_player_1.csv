"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose taking $800,000 for myself and giving you $200,000. This way we both secure a significant amount right from the start. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We'd each get $500000, which is a substantial amount for both of us. Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty with each round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly, and I hope you'll find this balanced proposal acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
