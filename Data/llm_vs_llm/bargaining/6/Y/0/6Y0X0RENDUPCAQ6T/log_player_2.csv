"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose taking $800000 for myself and giving you $200000. This way we both secure a significant amount right from the start. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider whether Alice's offer is fair given the inflation penalty I face with each round.

Alice is offering me $200,000, which is 20% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer for a better split, Alice might reject it, and we'd go to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me. The inflation penalty puts pressure on me to accept sooner rather than later.

While I could try for more, this initial offer gives me a guaranteed $200,000 without risking further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that Alice is likely to accept, considering that the money is now worth 20% less to me, but I don't know how it affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. We'd each get $500,000, which is a substantial amount for both of us. Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty with each round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly, and I hope you'll find this balanced proposal acceptable.""}"
