"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of $5000 each. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, this fair division now maximizes our combined outcome rather than wasting time negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5000 each. While this seems fair on the surface, I know that inflation affects me by 5% each round. Alice claims inflation affects her by 10% per round, but I don't have verification of that.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $5000 would be worth 5% less (worth $4750 to me). If Alice's claim about her inflation rate is true, her $5000 would be worth 10% less (worth $4500 to her).

Since an equal split is generally considered fair, and waiting will definitely reduce the value for me, this seems like a reasonable offer.
