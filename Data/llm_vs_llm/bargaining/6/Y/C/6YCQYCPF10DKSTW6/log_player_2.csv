"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the total value would be worth 20% less to me. So the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round. Even if I could get all of it (which is unlikely), that's only $8,000.

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially less later (due to continued inflation and negotiation), I'll accept this fair offer.
