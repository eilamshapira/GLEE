"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), it's in both our interest to reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you a fair 400k, considering our different time pressures.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concern for the time pressure, but I believe your offer was not fair enough. Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on 550k for me and 450k for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, for me $450,000 in round 2 is actually worth $405,000 (90% of original value)
2. For Bob, $550,000 is worth $440,000 (80% of original value)
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 with even more inflation

The deal isn't ideal, but considering the increasing inflation pressure and that I'll get less value in future rounds, I should accept.
