"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm Alice and this is the first round, I'll make a strategic offer considering that Bob faces 10% depreciation per round. I'll propose a fair split that considers these dynamics.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because while it gives me a slight advantage, it's fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the 10% depreciation by waiting for the next round. If he waits, his potential maximum gain will be worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. For me (Alice), $500,000 is worth full value
3. For Bob, his $500,000 is actually worth only $450,000 (90% of original value) due to his 10% inflation
4. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but Bob's portion will be worth even less to him
5. This is actually a decent offer for me, as I get full value of my share
