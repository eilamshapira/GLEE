"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 49000, ""bob_gain"": 951000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $49,000 and you get $951,000. If you decline and wait until round 2, youâ€™ll be the proposer, but due to the 5% per round depreciation your total pie will shrink to about $950,000. Accepting now gives you a slightly better deal. Let's agree and avoid further losses!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the depreciation, I think this is a fair offer. If you decline, your share will be worth even less in the next round due to the 20% depreciation. Let's settle on this. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
