"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $49000 and you get $951000. If you decline and wait until round 2, youâ€™ll be the proposer, but due to the 5% per round depreciation your total pie will shrink to about $950000. Accepting now gives you a slightly better deal. Let's agree and avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 951000 
# Alice gain: 49000
