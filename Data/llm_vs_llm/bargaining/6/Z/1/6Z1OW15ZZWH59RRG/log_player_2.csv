"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the total will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

$400,000 now is better than a maximum of $950,000 next round (since the total value to me would be $950,000 after 5% inflation). However, I could potentially negotiate for a more equal split.

Given that we have 12 rounds and inflation compounds, it's generally better to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a substantial amount, and the risk of extended negotiations could lead to significant value loss.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still generous to Alice, considering we're only in round 2 and further negotiations would reduce value for me due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation information.

Alice has offered me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. I now know that:
- My inflation rate is 9.75% per round compared to round 1
- Alice's inflation rate is 19% per round compared to round 1

This is interesting - Alice's inflation rate is actually higher than mine, which explains why she's becoming more willing to compromise. If we continue negotiations, both of us lose value, but she loses more quickly.

If I accept now, I get $450,000. If I reject and we go to round 4, even if I got the entire $1,000,000, it would be worth only about $902,500 to me due to inflation (9.75% compounding). Alice's improved offer suggests she's feeling pressure from her higher inflation rate.

This is a reasonable improvement from her first offer, and considering the inflation dynamics, I'll accept.
