"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. Given that:
1. It's a fair split
2. The money doesn't lose value for me over time
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. I have no information about how inflation affects Alice

It's reasonable to accept this fair offer right away rather than risk a potentially worse outcome later.
