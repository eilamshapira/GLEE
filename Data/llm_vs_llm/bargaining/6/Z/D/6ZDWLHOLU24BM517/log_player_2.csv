"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. While $40 is a substantial amount, the split isn't quite fair as Alice is taking a larger share. Since we have several rounds remaining, I can try to negotiate for a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair and equitable split.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal division that benefits both of us fairly."
