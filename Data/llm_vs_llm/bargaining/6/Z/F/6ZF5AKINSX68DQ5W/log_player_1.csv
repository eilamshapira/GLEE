I'm slowly decreasing my ask, but trying to keep a significant portion of the money. Bob is being incredibly unfair, but I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and he risks getting nothing."

While this is significantly less than I aimed for, it's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting nothing if Bob continues his current strategy.  The effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore."
