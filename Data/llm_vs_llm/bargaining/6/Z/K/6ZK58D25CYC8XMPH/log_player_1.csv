"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, delaying is quite costly for me. This offer gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to minimize my inflation losses. I hope we can agree quickly and both benefit!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but I'm facing 10% inflation per round myself. Given the difference in our inflation rates, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and I'm willing to settle quickly to minimize our shared losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but my inflation rate is significantly higher than yours (20% vs 10%). Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering our different inflation rates - my losses compound much faster than yours. Let's settle now to prevent both of us from losing more value through inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about meeting in the middle, but considering the difference in our inflation rates, I think a 58-42 split in my favor is more reasonable. Your higher inflation rate does mean you lose more value over time, but it also means you have more incentive to settle quickly. I'm willing to take on a bit more to account for my lower inflation rate, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're now 5 rounds in, and my money has already lost almost 50% of its value while yours has lost about 27%. If we continue this pattern, we'll both end up with significantly less. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is fair considering our inflation differences. This is my final compromise - if we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will make this negotiation pointless for both of us. Let's settle now and both walk away with substantial value.""}"
