"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * The total value will effectively be $950,000 for me
   * Alice may reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While $400,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. If I reject and we go another round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $421,053 ($400,000 รท 0.95) to make rejection worthwhile, considering the risk of Alice rejecting my counter-offer.

Given the substantial risk of value loss from inflation and potential further negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
