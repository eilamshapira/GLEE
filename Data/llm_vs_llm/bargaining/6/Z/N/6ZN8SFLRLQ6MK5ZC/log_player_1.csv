Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is more fair. We're both equal participants in this game, and this way we both walk away with a substantial amount. This balanced split ensures neither of us feels disadvantaged. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
