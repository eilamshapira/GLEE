"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair start, and we both get a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair for me. 

Alice is offering me 40% ($400,000) while taking 60% ($600,000) for herself. Since there's no inflation for me, the value won't decrease in future rounds. This gives me negotiating leverage to potentially get a better deal if I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round.

Given that we have 12 rounds total, I have time to negotiate for a more favorable split, possibly closer to 50/50.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is more fair. We're both equal participants in this game, and this way we both walk away with a substantial amount. This balanced split ensures neither of us feels disadvantaged.""}"
