"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me is fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, but its value will be 5% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

Since Bob's offer is not even close to an even split, and I'll be losing value due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than its original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2). To account for this, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation hurts you, not me 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $3500, but its value will be 15% less than its original value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, and 5.26% less in Round 3, but since it is 5% less each round, 5% * 3 = 15%  is a close enough approximation, but the actual value is 14.26% less, so $3500 * 0.8574 = $3000.9, but I will use $3000 as an approximation for simplicity). 

Since Bob's offer is not even close to an even split, and I'll be losing significant value due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19.26% less than its original value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, and 5% less in Round 4, but since it is 5% less each round, 5% * 4 = 20% is a close enough approximation, but the actual value is 19.26% less). To account for this, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value, I'm not 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $3000, but its value will be approximately 22.62% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $3000 * 0.7738 = $2321.4.

At this point, I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still not favorable to me. However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the inflation will reduce the value of my potential gain even further.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept this offer to minimize my losses.
