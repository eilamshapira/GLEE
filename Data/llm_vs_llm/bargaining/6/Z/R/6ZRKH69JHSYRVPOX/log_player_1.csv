"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. My money is still worth the same, but Bob's is effectively worth 5% less. Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Considering the rounds are progressing and the value of the money is diminishing, I'll try to secure a larger share than before.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the diminishing value of Bob's share due to inflation. My money is still worth the same, but Bob's is now significantly less valuable than in Round 1. Even though the split seems even, in practice, I'll be getting more due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
