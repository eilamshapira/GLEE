"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 out of the $100. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to inflation, the total value will be worth 5% less to me.

While I could try for more, there's a risk in prolonged negotiation due to the inflation effect. Each round reduces the money's value to me by 5%, and we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.

Let me make a counter-offer to see if we can reach a better agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for inflation while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more equitable than the initial offer and accounts for the fact that I'm facing inflation with each round. Since the money loses 5% value for me each round, I need to secure a better share now to maximize my outcome. This offer still gives Alice a substantial portion while improving my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I see now that Alice is experiencing much higher inflation than I am (36% vs my 9.75% by round 3). This is important information - she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly. However, she's now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40.

Given that:
1. The offer has improved in my favor
2. Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine
3. We still have the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds
4. My inflation rate is still significant at 5% per round

This is a reasonable offer that's close to a 50-50 split, and continuing to negotiate would decrease the value for both of us, especially for Alice.
