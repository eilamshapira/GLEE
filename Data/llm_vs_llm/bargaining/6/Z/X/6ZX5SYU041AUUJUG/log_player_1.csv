"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair 30% share. Due to 5% inflation per round, if we continue negotiating, we'll both lose value. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on you, a 40-60 split seems more fair. This way, you still get a larger share even after accounting for inflation. Let's settle for this deal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning: If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my share would be worth 5% less due to inflation. My current offered share of $600,000 at 5% inflation is worth $570,000, which is better than trying to negotiate for a higher amount in the next round where inflation would reduce the value further. Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation pressure, and it's best to conclude the deal now."
