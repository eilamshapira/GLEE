Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 30% share. Due to 5% inflation per round, if we continue negotiating, we'll both lose value. Let's make a deal now.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 40-60 split would be more equitable given the inflation effect on you. Let's settle for that.
