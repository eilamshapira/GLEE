"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split to myself since I'm making the first offer, but still giving Bob a substantial portion. This is reasonable considering the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which should be fair for both of us. Since Bob is facing a higher inflation penalty (10% per round) compared to my 5% penalty, this equal division should be appealing to him now. For me, this amount after my 10% inflation (two rounds of 5%) is still better than accepting Bob's previous offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a better deal, recognizing that the inflation is affecting him more severely (27.1% so far versus my 14.26%). While I'm offering less for myself than my previous offer, this division should be more appealing to Bob and still provides me with a decent amount after inflation. We're both losing value with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
