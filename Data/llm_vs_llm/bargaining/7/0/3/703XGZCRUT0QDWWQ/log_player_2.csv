"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives us each $5,000. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation penalties.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty while Alice only faces a 5% penalty. This significant difference in inflation rates favors accepting early rather than prolonging negotiations, especially for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value for me would be reduced to $8,000 (after my 20% penalty). Even if I proposed keeping all $8,000 for myself (which Alice would likely reject), I'd be worse off than taking $5,000 now.

Given these considerations, the 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable considering our different inflation penalties.
