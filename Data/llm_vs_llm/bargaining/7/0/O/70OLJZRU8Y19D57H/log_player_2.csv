"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so the total amount I consider is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make a fair offer, considering the reduced amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 81% of its original value for me (100% - 19% = 81%). Since Alice's offer gives me $45, its actual value to me is $45 * 0.81 = $36.45.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not favorable to me, especially since I offered a similar split in the previous round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer again, the money is now worth even less for me due to inflation. The total amount I consider is $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $81 (29% less than the original amount).

I'll make a more generous offer to Alice this time, hoping to end the game.
