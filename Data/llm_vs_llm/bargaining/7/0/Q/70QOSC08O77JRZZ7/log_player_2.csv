"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $95 in the next round from my perspective. I could propose a better split for myself, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept. And if we keep going back and forth, the value continues to diminish.

While the offer isn't completely even, getting $40 now is better than potentially getting less value later after multiple rounds of rejection.
