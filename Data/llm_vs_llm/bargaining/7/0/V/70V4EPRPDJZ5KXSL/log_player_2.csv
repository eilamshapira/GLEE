"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000 of the $10,000. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. However, for Alice, the money would be worth 20% less, so just $8,000 in her perspective.

Given this asymmetric inflation penalty, I have more bargaining power in later rounds. If I make a counter-offer, I could potentially get a better deal, especially since Alice faces a much steeper inflation penalty than I do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counterproposal that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a much higher inflation penalty (20% per round versus my 5%), I have more leverage, but I still want to make a fair offer that she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and Alice gets $4,500. This is fair considering that if we continue to later rounds, Alice's value will decrease much faster than mine. For Alice, accepting now is better than waiting another round where her $4,500 would be worth only $3,600 to her after her 20% inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 (up from her initial $4,000 offer), while she takes $5,500.

Due to inflation, at this point:
- For me, the money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we move to round 4:
- My inflation would increase to about 14.75%
- Alice's inflation would increase to about 56%

Given the much steeper inflation penalty Alice faces, her offering me more than her initial proposal shows she's recognizing the time pressure. This offer is more favorable to me than her first one, and the inflation differential continues to work in my favor.

However, I think I can still get a better deal given our asymmetric inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more attractive offer that takes into account our current inflation positions. Since we're now in round 4, Alice faces a much higher inflation penalty than I do - her money is already worth 36% less while mine is only 9.75% less. If we continue to the next round, her position will worsen significantly more than mine.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. This is a reasonable offer considering our asymmetric inflation rates. For Alice, accepting $4,000 now is better than risking further rounds where her money would continue to rapidly decrease in value. If she rejects this and we go another round, her $4,000 would be worth only $3,200 to her after another 20% inflation, while my potential gain would only decrease by 5%."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer of an even 50-50 split.

Current inflation situation:
- My money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 59.04% less than round 1

If I reject and we go to round 6:
- My inflation would increase to about 23.55%
- Alice's inflation would increase to about 79.04% (nearly 80%)

Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,500 to $5,000, showing she recognizes her deteriorating position due to inflation. A 50-50 split would normally be considered fair, but given our asymmetric inflation penalties, time strongly favors me in negotiations.

However, we're now in round 5 of 12 possible rounds. Alice's money is already worth less than half its original value, while mine still retains over 80% of its value. If we continue too long, we risk running out of rounds and both getting nothing.

Given that Alice has made a significant concession and offered an even split, and considering the risk of prolonged negotiation:
