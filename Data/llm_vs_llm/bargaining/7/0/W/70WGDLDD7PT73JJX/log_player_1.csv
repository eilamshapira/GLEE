# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a serious factor, and Bob is using it to his advantage. However, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half after starting at a fair split. I need to show firmness and hope Bob starts negotiating more realistically.  The shrinking pot is bad for both of us."
