"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. Since there's 20% inflation on my end per round, I should try to reach an agreement early. Let me make a fair initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division where we both get the same amount. With inflation affecting future rounds, I think it makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than delaying.""}"
