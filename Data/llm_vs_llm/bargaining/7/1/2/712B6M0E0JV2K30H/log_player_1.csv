"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while Bob isn't, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point that gives Bob a substantial portion while still securing a good amount for myself. If Bob rejects this, my next opportunity to make an offer would come after losing 10% to inflation (two rounds), which would significantly reduce the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $450,000, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $427,500 to me
- If I reject, we go to the next round where:
  - I can make a new offer
  - But my money will be worth 10% less due to inflation
  - And Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation

Even though Bob is taking more than they offered me, accepting $427,500 in real value now is better than risking further inflation losses. If I reject and we continue, each round reduces my purchasing power while Bob's remains unchanged, weakening my negotiating position.
