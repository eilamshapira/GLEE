"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 out of the total $1,000,000, which is less than half. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I can make a counteroffer in the next round without losing value. This gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure Alice faces while still seeking a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair split considering that waiting another round would cost Alice 5% of her value due to inflation, while it costs me nothing to wait. My proposal gives Alice a significant portion while recognizing my stronger negotiating position."
