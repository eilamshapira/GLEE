450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, since you face a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), we should make a deal quickly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair considering our different inflation risks. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth significantly less due to your 20% inflation rate.",Bob,2,
