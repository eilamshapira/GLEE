"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), we should make a deal quickly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair considering our different inflation risks. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth significantly less due to your 20% inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
