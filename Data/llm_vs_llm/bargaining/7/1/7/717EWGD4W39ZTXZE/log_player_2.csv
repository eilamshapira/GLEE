"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000 at full value
   * Alice gets $600,000

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a counter-offer
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * This gives me negotiating leverage since Alice's inflation penalty is higher

Given that Alice's inflation penalty is significantly higher (20% vs my 5%), I have a strong negotiating position. A 60-40 split in her favor doesn't reflect this advantage. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for my 5% inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates, I should propose a split that favors me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering she faces 20% inflation per round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), we should make a deal quickly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fair considering our different inflation risks. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth significantly less due to your 20% inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we both need to consider the impact of inflation, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This is a fair compromise given the rapid decrease in value for me. Let's end this soon before our shares diminish further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 at 90.25% value = $406,125 effective value
   * Alice gets $550,000 at 64% value = $352,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a counter-offer
   * My money will be worth 14.75% less than original
   * Alice's money will be worth 48.8% less than original
   * The gap in our inflation penalties continues to widen

Given that:
1. Alice's effective gain ($352,000) is now less than mine ($406,125)
2. The offer is better than her first one
3. Further delays will significantly reduce value for both of us
4. We're already in round 3 and need to reach agreement within 12 rounds

This seems like a reasonable compromise, and the effective values actually favor me due to the inflation differences.
