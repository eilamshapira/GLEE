6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55-45 split is a fair compromise, considering inflation. I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I need to make sure I get a good share as well.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. With 10% inflation loss for you so far, this 55-45 split in my favor is actually better for you than waiting longer. If we keep going, you'll lose more value due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still not comfortable with a 55-45 split. I'm willing to go for a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal considering the current situation.",Bob,4,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, you've now lost about 19% to inflation. A 58-42 split might seem worse than your last offer, but considering the inflation effect, you'd actually get more value by accepting now than continuing to negotiate. Let's end this efficiently.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hurting me more now, but I'm still not comfortable with the split you're proposing. I'm willing to compromise a little more and offer you a 52-48 split. This is the closest I can go at this point.",Bob,6,
