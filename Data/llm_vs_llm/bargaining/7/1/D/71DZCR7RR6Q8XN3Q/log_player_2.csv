Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. With 10% inflation loss for you so far, this 55-45 split in my favor is actually better for you than waiting longer. If we keep going, you'll lose more value due to inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
