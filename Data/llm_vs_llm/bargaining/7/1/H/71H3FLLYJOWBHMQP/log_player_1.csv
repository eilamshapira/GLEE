"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the money loses 5% value for you each round, waiting is costly for you. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than $5000 in future rounds. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the time pressure, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't wait for further devaluation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is now worth about 10% less to you compared to round 1, and will continue to devalue. This $3500 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for future rounds where the value drops further. This is my final reasonable offer considering the continuing devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but considering the significant devaluation of the money (14.26% less) and the fact that it will continue to decrease, I think I should accept this offer to avoid further losses.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
