"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split of the money, where we each get $5,000.

I need to consider that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for Alice, but maintains its full value for me. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds, as Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

If I reject this offer now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Since the money will be worth 5% less to Alice then, I could potentially negotiate a more favorable split for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges the time pressure on Alice while seeking a more favorable distribution for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, since the money loses 5% value for you each round, waiting is costly for you. This offer gives you $4,000 now, which is worth more than $5,000 in future rounds. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a reasonable split, don't wait for further devaluation 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 and taking $5,500 for herself, which is actually worse for me than her original even split offer.

I should note that:
1. The money maintains full value for me regardless of how many rounds pass
2. For Alice, the money has already lost 9.75% of its value
3. If we move to another round, her money will devalue further

Given that I have no time pressure while Alice faces increasing devaluation, I have stronger negotiating power. Alice's offer is giving herself more than her initial offer while giving me less, which doesn't make strategic sense from my position.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Alice, the money is now worth about 10% less to you compared to round 1, and will continue to devalue. This $3,500 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for future rounds where the value drops further. This is my final reasonable offer considering the continuing devaluation.""}"
