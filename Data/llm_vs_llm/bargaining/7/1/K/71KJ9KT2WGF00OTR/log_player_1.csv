"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in subsequent rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. If Bob rejects this offer, the next round's money will be worth 5% less to me, so I'm incentivized to make a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 5% less to me, so effectively $427,500
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but then any money I get will be worth another 5% less (10% less than original value)
3. This could turn into a back-and-forth where we both lose value due to inflation (at least I do)
4. The current offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible

Given that inflation is eating into my gains with each round, and this offer is reasonably fair, I should probably accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
