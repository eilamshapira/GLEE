"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer based on the inflation effect on my side and the fairness principle.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split where we each get $5,000. This is an equal division which is generally considered fair. 

However, I need to consider that if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means in the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me.

Since Alice is offering me $5,000 now, and the maximum I could potentially get in the next round would be worth less due to inflation, accepting this equal split is reasonable.
