"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm starting with a slight advantage to secure a larger portion early on. I hope Bob will accept this, as it's a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation penalty. Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $70, Bob gets $30.
*   **Inflation:** My $70 is now worth 80% of its original value, meaning it's effectively worth $70 * 0.8 = $56.

While $56 is less than my initial offer of $60 (in round 1 dollars), it's still a decent amount, and we're only in Round 2. I am worried about later round offers so I will accept it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
