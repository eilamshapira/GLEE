Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200

This offer is still not in my favor, even considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, particularly for Alice. While not ideal, accepting this offer avoids the risk of getting an even lower amount in subsequent rounds."
