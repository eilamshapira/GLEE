Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an even 50-50 split, ensuring fairness for both of us with no need to worry about inflation impact. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $5000, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation
   * Real value for me = $5000 * 0.95 = $4750

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * There's risk Bob rejects again
   * The longer this goes, the more value we both lose

3. This is actually a decent offer considering:
   * It's a fair 50-50 split
   * The inflation loss isn't too severe yet
   * Further delays will only reduce value more
