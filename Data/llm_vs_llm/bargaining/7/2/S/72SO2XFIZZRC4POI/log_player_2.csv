"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $8,000 for me (20% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I need to calculate the actual value I'd receive. 

36% less than the original value means I'd get 64% of the face value (100% - 36% = 64%). 

For Alice's offer of $6667, the actual value I'd get is $6667 * 0.64 = $4269 (approximately).

Considering this, I think Alice's offer is relatively fair, given the inflation.
