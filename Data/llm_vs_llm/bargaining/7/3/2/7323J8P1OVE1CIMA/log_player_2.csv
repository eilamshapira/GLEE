"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer for an equal 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000.

While this is a fair offer, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the entire $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 in my valuation.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to get more than $625,000 just to match the current $500,000 offer's value (since $625,000 after 20% inflation equals $500,000 in present value).

Given this inflation penalty and the fairness of the initial 50-50 split, accepting is the rational choice.
