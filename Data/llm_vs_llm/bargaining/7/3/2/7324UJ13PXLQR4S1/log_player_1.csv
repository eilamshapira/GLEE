"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept since inflation will hurt my gains if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the next round."
