"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm trying to start with a somewhat favorable offer, but not so greedy that Bob will immediately reject it. I need to factor in the potential for inflation to hurt me if we go to later rounds."
