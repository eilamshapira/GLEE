"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the inflation effect.

If I reject now, I get to make a proposal in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. My $40 would effectively be worth $38 (40 * 0.95) in the next round's terms.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice might still reject, and we'd go to round 3 with further inflation for me.

Given that I'd get $40 now, which is a substantial portion, and the certainty of declining value in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
