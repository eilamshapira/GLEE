"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, considering the 5% inflation per round that affects my share.

If I accept: I get $4,000 now.
If I reject: In the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but due to 5% inflation, each dollar will be worth 5% less to me.

While Alice's offer gives her more than half, rejecting means I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,000 in the next round to account for the inflation penalty. Given this inflation risk, and that $4,000 is a substantial portion of the total amount, I'll accept the offer.
