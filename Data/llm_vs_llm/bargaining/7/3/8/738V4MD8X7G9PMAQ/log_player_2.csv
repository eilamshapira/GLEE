"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options here. Alice has offered an even 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we go to another round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be only 95% of the original $100. Even if I were to get a larger portion in the next round, I need to weigh that against this 5% loss in value.

With a 50-50 split now, I get $50 immediately with no inflation penalty.
