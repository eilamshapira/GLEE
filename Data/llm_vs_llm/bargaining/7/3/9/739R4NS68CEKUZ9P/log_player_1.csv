"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think we should split the money in a way that benefits us both. Since you didn't mention how inflation affects you, I'll assume it's similar for both of us. My offer is slightly more in my favor to account for the loss in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
