"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money reasonably. I propose I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a generous offer considering the inflation we face with each round. Let's take it! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think we should split the money in a way that benefits us both. Since you didn't mention how inflation affects you, I'll assume it's similar for both of us. My offer is slightly more in my favor to account for the loss in the next round.""}"
