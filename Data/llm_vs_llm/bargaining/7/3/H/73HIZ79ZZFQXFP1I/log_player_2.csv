"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this. 

Alice is proposing to give me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (and 10% less to Alice).

If I reject, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round due to the 20% inflation for me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I need to consider this reduction in value.

Given that Alice faces less severe inflation (10%), and considering the significant amount I'd still receive, I'll accept this offer.
