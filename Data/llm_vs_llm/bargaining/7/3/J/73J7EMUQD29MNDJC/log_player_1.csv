"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, given the value decrease with each round.  Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less to him in each round, and this is the third round, his share will be worth 19% less than the original value (10% less in round 2, and another 9% of the 90% remaining, which is approximately 10% less in total,  but for simplicity, we will use the exact figures: 10% in round 2 and 10% of 90% = 9% in round 3, for a total of 19% less).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value for you, this is a generous offer!""}"
