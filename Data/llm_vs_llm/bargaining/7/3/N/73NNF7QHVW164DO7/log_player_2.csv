"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face 20% inflation with each round. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me. If we agree now, we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4,500 for me
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The $10,000 will be worth 10% less to me (so $9,000)
   * I can make my own proposal
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation

Alice claims she faces 20% inflation, but I can't verify this. However, her offer isn't terribly unfair - it's a 45/55 split.

Given that:
- I get a decent portion ($4,500)
- Rejecting means immediate 10% loss of value
- Further rounds could lead to more value loss
- No guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

I'll accept this offer.
