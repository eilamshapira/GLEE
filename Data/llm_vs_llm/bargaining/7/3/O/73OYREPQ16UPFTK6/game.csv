550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle this immediately. In round 1 every dollar is fully worth, and waiting only reduces my share by 10% per round. I’m offering you $450K to share the pie fairly while preempting any loss from delay. Let’s close the deal now!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd rather not wait. I'm offering you $400K which is still a significant amount. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,

554000.0,446000.0,"Hi Bob, I know time is money, and further rounds will only hurt us both. In round 3, my cash is discounted 20% (so every dollar is worth 80% of round 1’s value) while I suspect you’ll see even steeper losses in your own round if we wait further. My proposal gives you $446K, which—at today’s value—amounts to roughly 70% of that sum, or about $312K in effective terms. That’s a bit better than what you might obtain as proposer in the next round given the inflation. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid additional value loss!",Alice,3,
