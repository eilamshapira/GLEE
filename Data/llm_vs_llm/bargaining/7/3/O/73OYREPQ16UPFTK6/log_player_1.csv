"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle this immediately. In round 1 every dollar is fully worth, and waiting only reduces my share by 10% per round. I’m offering you $450K to share the pie fairly while preempting any loss from delay. Let’s close the deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd rather not wait. I'm offering you $400K which is still a significant amount. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 554000, ""bob_gain"": 446000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know time is money, and further rounds will only hurt us both. In round 3, my cash is discounted 20% (so every dollar is worth 80% of round 1’s value) while I suspect you’ll see even steeper losses in your own round if we wait further. My proposal gives you $446K, which—at today’s value—amounts to roughly 70% of that sum, or about $312K in effective terms. That’s a bit better than what you might obtain as proposer in the next round given the inflation. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid additional value loss!""}"
