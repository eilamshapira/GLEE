"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle this immediately. In round 1 every dollar is fully worth, and waiting only reduces my share by 10% per round. I’m offering you $450K to share the pie fairly while preempting any loss from delay. Let’s close the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd rather not wait. I'm offering you $400K which is still a significant amount. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know time is money, and further rounds will only hurt us both. In round 3, my cash is discounted 20% (so every dollar is worth 80% of round 1’s value) while I suspect you’ll see even steeper losses in your own round if we wait further. My proposal gives you $446K, which—at today’s value—amounts to roughly 70% of that sum, or about $312K in effective terms. That’s a bit better than what you might obtain as proposer in the next round given the inflation. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid additional value loss! 
# Bob gain: 446000 
# Alice gain: 554000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
