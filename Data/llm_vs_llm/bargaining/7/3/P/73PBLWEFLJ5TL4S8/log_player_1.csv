"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's value of the money decreases by 20% each round, and it's now the 3rd round, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value to Bob. 

To maximize my gain, I should offer Bob an amount that is equivalent to 0.64 * x = 400000 (since 400000 is the minimum I think he would accept, considering his offer in round 2), where x is the amount I offer him.

Solving for x: x = 400000 / 0.64 = 625000.

So, I will offer Bob $625000, and I will keep $375000.
