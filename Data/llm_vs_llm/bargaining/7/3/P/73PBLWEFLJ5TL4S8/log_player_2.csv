Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $800,000. I'll make an offer to divide this amount.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 625000 
# Alice gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 36% decrease in value for me, the effective amount I would get is approximately 0.64 * 625000 = 400000.
