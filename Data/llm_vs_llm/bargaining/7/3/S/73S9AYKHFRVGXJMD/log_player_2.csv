"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. That's a 40-60 split in her favor
3. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000 for the next round
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. While not an even split, $400,000 is still a significant amount

However, since this is the first round and there's minimal inflation impact yet, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while remaining reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. We both walk away with half a million dollars, and there's no need to lose money to inflation.""}"
