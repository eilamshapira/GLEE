Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiations due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. A 55/45 split seems fair considering the time pressure and potential for inflation to hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty isn't too severe yet (only 10%), and as the first mover in the next round, I can try to negotiate a better position. A 45-55 split in Bob's favor isn't attractive enough at this stage of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm compromising from my initial offer. This 55-45 split is fair, and we should agree quickly before inflation erodes our gains further. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value.""}"
