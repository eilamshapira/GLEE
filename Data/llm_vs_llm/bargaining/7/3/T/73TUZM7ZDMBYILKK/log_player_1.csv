"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair division that accounts for the 20% per round inflation penalty I face.
Since getting this resolved quickly is more valuable to me due to inflation, I'll make a generous initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split given that any delays will reduce the value of my share."
