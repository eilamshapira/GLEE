"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering inflation, my $400,000 is now worth less. My money is now worth 80% of its value, which I will consider when making the decision.

I will analyze the offer:

*   **Alice's gain:** $400,000 (but worth less due to inflation)
*   **Bob's gain:** $600,000

Given the inflation, it's becoming increasingly important to secure some money. While this isn't an ideal split, accepting the offer would still leave me with something.
