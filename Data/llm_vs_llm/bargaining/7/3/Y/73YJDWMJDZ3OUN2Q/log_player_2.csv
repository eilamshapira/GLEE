"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and equitable. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds, and we might end up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

This is a fair first offer that respects both parties equally. I'll accept it.
