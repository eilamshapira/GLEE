71.43,28.57,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. If you reject and we move to round 2, the pie—and thus your eventual share—will be discounted even further (by 20% for you). I believe this offer is fair given our different discounting rates. Please accept so we can both secure the best possible value.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to do it, and it avoids us both losing out on a significant amount of money.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob's offer gives me $50 in round 2, which—after the 10% discount—is worth $45 in round-1 value. Given that I will be the proposer in round 3 (where my share will be discounted by 20%, but I have bargaining power and can adjust the offer), my expected continuation value exceeds $45 in today’s terms. Hence, I’m going to reject your even split proposal.",Alice,2,reject
71.43,28.57,"Hi Bob, in round 3 my proposed split is that I get $71.43 and you get $28.57. Remember that in this round every dollar for me is worth 0.81 of its face value and for you 0.64. That means your share is worth about 28.57 × 0.64 ≈ $18.3 in round‐1 value. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but then your money will be discounted further (to 0.512 of its face value) and in equilibrium you’d end up with roughly the same effective value. In other words, my offer gives you as much as you’d expect to get by waiting. Please accept the proposal to avoid any further loss from inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you 60% of the remaining money, but we need to reach a deal soon or the inflation will eat away at both of our potential gains.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, accepting your offer in Round 4 would secure me $60, which—after a 27.1% discount—amounts to about $43.74 in Round‐1 value. By rejecting now and taking the role of proposer in Round 5, I can tailor an offer that better reflects our respective discount factors and our future bargaining positions. I expect that my continuation value by proposing in Round 5 will exceed $43.74 in today’s terms. For these reasons, I'm going to reject your offer and look forward to presenting my proposal in Round 5.",Alice,4,reject
63.0,37.0,"Hi Bob, in round 5 I propose that I receive $63 and you receive $37. At this stage, every dollar for me is worth about 0.6561 of its original value and every dollar for you is worth about 0.4096. This offer gives you an effective value of roughly $15.15 in round‐1 terms. If you choose to reject and wait until round 6—when you'll be the proposer—the further discounting (with your dollars worth only 0.32768 of their original value) will force you to compete with your own lower bargaining power. In other words, by accepting this proposal you secure at least as much as you’d expect to achieve by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution that minimizes the loss from inflation. I hope you agree and accept.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
65.0,35.0,"Alice, the inflation is hurting both of us. Let's be realistic and split the money so we both get something.  I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid us getting nothing at all.  Let's get this done.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand the pressure of inflation, but your offer in Round 6 would give me $65, which—after applying the 40.95% discount—amounts to roughly $38.38 in today’s terms. As I'll be the proposer in Round 7, I expect to secure a better effective payoff by tailoring the proposal to our respective discount factors. For these reasons, I’m rejecting your offer and look forward to presenting my proposal in the next round.",Alice,6,reject
44.8,55.2,"Hi Bob, in round 7 my proposal is that I receive $44.80 and you receive $55.20. Here’s the reasoning: At this stage (round 7), each dollar for me is worth about 0.5314 of its original value and for you about 0.2621. If you reject my offer, you'll be making the proposal in round 8, where—by similar backward‐induction reasoning—you can secure about $69 for yourself. However, because of your additional discounting (moving from a 0.2621 multiplier in round 7 to a 0.2097 multiplier in round 8), that $69 would be worth only 0.8 times as much for you in round‐7 terms—that is, about $55.20. My offer gives you exactly that amount now, matching your continuation value. I believe this is a fair division given the discounting pressures, so I hope you accept.",Alice,7,
