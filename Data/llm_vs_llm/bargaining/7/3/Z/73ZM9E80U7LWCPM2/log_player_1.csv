"Round 1

Please accept so we can both secure the best possible value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to do it, and it avoids us both losing out on a significant amount of money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob's offer gives me $50 in round 2, which—after the 10% discount—is worth $45 in round-1 value. Given that I will be the proposer in round 3 (where my share will be discounted by 20%, but I have bargaining power and can adjust the offer), my expected continuation value exceeds $45 in today’s terms. Hence, I’m going to reject your even split proposal.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 71.43, ""bob_gain"": 28.57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 my proposed split is that I get $71.43 and you get $28.57. Remember that in this round every dollar for me is worth 0.81 of its face value and for you 0.64. That means your share is worth about 28.57 × 0.64 ≈ $18.3 in round‐1 value. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but then your money will be discounted further (to 0.512 of its face value) and in equilibrium you’d end up with roughly the same effective value. In other words, my offer gives you as much as you’d expect to get by waiting. Please accept the proposal to avoid any further loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you 60% of the remaining money, but we need to reach a deal soon or the inflation will eat away at both of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, accepting your offer in Round 4 would secure me $60, which—after a 27.1% discount—amounts to about $43.74 in Round‐1 value. By rejecting now and taking the role of proposer in Round 5, I can tailor an offer that better reflects our respective discount factors and our future bargaining positions. I expect that my continuation value by proposing in Round 5 will exceed $43.74 in today’s terms. For these reasons, I'm going to reject your offer and look forward to presenting my proposal in Round 5.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 63, ""bob_gain"": 37, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 5 I propose that I receive $63 and you receive $37. At this stage, every dollar for me is worth about 0.6561 of its original value and every dollar for you is worth about 0.4096. This offer gives you an effective value of roughly $15.15 in round‐1 terms. If you choose to reject and wait until round 6—when you'll be the proposer—the further discounting (with your dollars worth only 0.32768 of their original value) will force you to compete with your own lower bargaining power. In other words, by accepting this proposal you secure at least as much as you’d expect to achieve by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution that minimizes the loss from inflation. I hope you agree and accept.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hurting both of us. Let's be realistic and split the money so we both get something.  I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid us getting nothing at all.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 44.8, ""bob_gain"": 55.2, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 7 my proposal is that I receive $44.80 and you receive $55.20. Here’s the reasoning: At this stage (round 7), each dollar for me is worth about 0.5314 of its original value and for you about 0.2621. If you reject my offer, you'll be making the proposal in round 8, where—by similar backward‐induction reasoning—you can secure about $69 for yourself. However, because of your additional discounting (moving from a 0.2621 multiplier in round 7 to a 0.2097 multiplier in round 8), that $69 would be worth only 0.8 times as much for you in round‐7 terms—that is, about $55.20. My offer gives you exactly that amount now, matching your continuation value. I believe this is a fair division given the discounting pressures, so I hope you accept.""}"
