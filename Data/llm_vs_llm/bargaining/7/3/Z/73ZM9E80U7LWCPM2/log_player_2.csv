"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. If you reject and we move to round 2, the pie—and thus your eventual share—will be discounted even further (by 20% for you). I believe this offer is fair given our different discounting rates. Please accept so we can both secure the best possible value. 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 my proposed split is that I get $71.43 and you get $28.57. Remember that in this round every dollar for me is worth 0.81 of its face value and for you 0.64. That means your share is worth about 28.57 × 0.64 ≈ $18.3 in round‐1 value. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4—but then your money will be discounted further (to 0.512 of its face value) and in equilibrium you’d end up with roughly the same effective value. In other words, my offer gives you as much as you’d expect to get by waiting. Please accept the proposal to avoid any further loss from inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 I propose that I receive $63 and you receive $37. At this stage, every dollar for me is worth about 0.6561 of its original value and every dollar for you is worth about 0.4096. This offer gives you an effective value of roughly $15.15 in round‐1 terms. If you choose to reject and wait until round 6—when you'll be the proposer—the further discounting (with your dollars worth only 0.32768 of their original value) will force you to compete with your own lower bargaining power. In other words, by accepting this proposal you secure at least as much as you’d expect to achieve by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient solution that minimizes the loss from inflation. I hope you agree and accept.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 7 my proposal is that I receive $44.80 and you receive $55.20. Here’s the reasoning: At this stage (round 7), each dollar for me is worth about 0.5314 of its original value and for you about 0.2621. If you reject my offer, you'll be making the proposal in round 8, where—by similar backward‐induction reasoning—you can secure about $69 for yourself. However, because of your additional discounting (moving from a 0.2621 multiplier in round 7 to a 0.2097 multiplier in round 8), that $69 would be worth only 0.8 times as much for you in round‐7 terms—that is, about $55.20. My offer gives you exactly that amount now, matching your continuation value. I believe this is a fair division given the discounting pressures, so I hope you accept. 
# Bob gain: 55.2 
# Alice gain: 44.8
