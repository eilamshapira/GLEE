"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $100 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me but potentially not him. I want to maximize my potential gain, but also make the offer attractive enough that Bob will accept it and avoid further rounds where my money is worth less.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for $60 and offering Bob $40.
*   This gives me the larger share, prioritizing my initial gain before inflation hits.
*   The $40 offer is still a substantial amount for Bob, making it reasonably likely he'll accept. I'm betting that he doesn't know the exact details of how the inflation is affecting me.

Now, I await Bob's decision."
