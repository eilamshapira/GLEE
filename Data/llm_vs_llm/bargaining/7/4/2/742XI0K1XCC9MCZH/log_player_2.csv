"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, for the proposal, I'll still use the original $10,000 amount.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50/50 split of the original amount, considering the decreasing value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4200 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $2688.

For Alice, the value of the money she would gain is $5800 * 0.9025 (1 - 0.0975) = $5236.5.

Given the significant decrease in value for me and the fact that we still have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal later.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less for me (since two rounds have passed for me), and 5% * 2 = 10% less for Alice (since two rounds have passed for her, but the decrease is 5% per round for her, and one round where she made the offer, which also decreased her value, making it 2 rounds of decrease for her, but the first decrease was in round 2 for her, and the second in round 3 for her, so the total decrease is 5% + 4.75% = 9.75% as stated before), but for the calculation of the value for Alice in this round we consider the 5% decrease per round for Alice, so for this round the value for Alice decreased 5% from the last round, making the total decrease for Alice 9.75% + 5% = 14.75%.


However, the actual decrease for me is 20% + 20% = 36% as stated before (for the two rounds that passed for me), and for Alice is 5% + 4.75% = 9.75% as stated before (for the two rounds that passed for her), and now for this round the value for Alice decreased 5% from the last round, making the total decrease for Alice 9.75% + 5% = 14.75%.


The actual value I'm considering for myself is $10,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $6,400, and for Alice is $10,000 * (1 - 0.1475) = $8,525.


To make a fair offer, I'll propose a split that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $3800 * (1 - 0.5904) = $1543.20.

For Alice, the value of the money she would gain is $6200 * (1 - 0.1855) = $5048.70.

Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'm starting to consider accepting an offer to avoid further losses. However, I'll still reject this offer as it seems to favor Alice too much.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 59.04% + 20% = 69.44% less for me (since three rounds have passed for me, with 20% decrease in the first and second rounds, and the third decrease of 20% is for the round that just passed, but the value for the previous rounds was already decreased, so we have 36% for the first two rounds, and then 20% of the 64% that remained, which is approximately 20% + 20% + 20% = 51.2% + 8.32% = 59.52%, but the actual decrease was stated as 59.04%, and now for this round the value for me decreased 20% from the last round, but the last round value was already decreased by 59.04%, making the total decrease 59.04% + 20% of the 40.96% that remained, which is 59.04% + 8.192% = 67.232%, and for the calculation we will use the stated 69.44% decrease for this round, but for the calculation of the previous rounds we used the 59.04% decrease), and 18.55% + 5% = 23.55% less for Alice (since three rounds have passed for her, with 5% decrease in the first and second rounds for her, but the value for the first round was decreased by 5%, and then the second round was decreased by 4.75%, making the total decrease 9.75%, and then for the third round the value decreased by 5% from the last round, but the last round value was already decreased by 9.75%, and then for the fourth round the value for Alice decreased 5% from the last round, making the total decrease 9.75% + 5% = 14.75%, and then for the fifth round the value for Alice decreased 5% from the last round, but the last round value was already decreased by 14.75%, making the total decrease 14.75% + 4.0875% = 18.8375%, and for this round the value for Alice decreased 5% from the last round, making the total decrease 18.8375% + 4.2125% = 23.05%, but for the calculation we will use the stated 23.55% decrease, but the actual decrease was 23.05%).


However, for the calculation of the value of the money we will use the stated decreases.


The actual value I'm considering for myself is $10,000 * (1 - 0.6944) = $3056, and for Alice is $10,000 * (1 - 0.2355) = $7645.


To make a fair offer, I'll propose a split that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us.
