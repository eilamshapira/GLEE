3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division that reflects our differing sensitivities to delay. Since my money loses 10% in value each round and yours only 5%, a fair equilibrium (if we were to bargain longer) would give you a larger share. I propose that I receive $3448 and you get $6552. Accepting this offer now preserves as much value as possible for both of us. What do you think?",Alice,1,
