"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3448, ""bob_gain"": 6552, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division that reflects our differing sensitivities to delay. Since my money loses 10% in value each round and yours only 5%, a fair equilibrium (if we were to bargain longer) would give you a larger share. I propose that I receive $3,448 and you get $6,552. Accepting this offer now preserves as much value as possible for both of us. What do you think?""}"
