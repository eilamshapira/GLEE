"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division that reflects our differing sensitivities to delay. Since my money loses 10% in value each round and yours only 5%, a fair equilibrium (if we were to bargain longer) would give you a larger share. I propose that I receive $3448 and you get $6552. Accepting this offer now preserves as much value as possible for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
