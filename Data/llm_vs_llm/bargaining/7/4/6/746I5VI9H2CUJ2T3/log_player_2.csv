"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where I can make a counter-offer
3. However, the total amount will be reduced by 10% (to $900,000)
4. She's right about wanting to end quickly due to inflation
5. While a 50-50 split might seem fairer, the loss from inflation would eat into any gains from negotiating

A guaranteed $400,000 now is better than risking inflation trying to get a slightly better deal. It's a reasonable offer, even if not perfectly equal.
