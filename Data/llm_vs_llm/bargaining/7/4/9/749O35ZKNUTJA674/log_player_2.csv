I need to push Alice towards a more equitable split. While the decreasing value due to inflation is a concern, accepting a deal where I consistently get significantly less than Alice is not a sustainable strategy."

I understand the pressure of the shrinking pot from my perspective, but I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  A 50/50 split is the fairest, and I'm hoping she'll see the value in that soon."
