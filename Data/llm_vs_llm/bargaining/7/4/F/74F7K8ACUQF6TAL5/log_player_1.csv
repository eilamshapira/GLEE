"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering that inflation reduces my money's value by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us substantial amounts while acknowledging that I have the first-mover advantage but still want to make an offer Bob would find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob wants more than half, and I need to consider that I'm facing 10% inflation each round. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which gives each of us $500,000. This is completely fair and equitable. Since I've already lost 10% of my money's value due to inflation (and will lose more if we continue negotiating), an even split represents a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests."
