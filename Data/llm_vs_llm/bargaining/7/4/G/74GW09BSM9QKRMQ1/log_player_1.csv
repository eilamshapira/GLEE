"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and then decide.

*   **My Gain (Alice):** $4500, but worth 20% less due to inflation.  So, my effective gain is $4500 \* 0.80 = $3600.
*   **Bob's Gain:** $5500.

Since it's round 2, I have fewer rounds left. This offer gives me $3600 in real terms, even though Bob gets more. I need to consider whether I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.

I will **reject** this offer.
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down with the inflation percentages given:

*   **My Gain (Alice):** $4000, but worth 48.8% less due to inflation. So my effective gain is $4000 \* (1 - 0.488) = $4000 \* 0.512 = $2048
*   **Bob's Gain:** $6000, but worth 14.26% less, so effectively worth $6000 \* (1 - 0.1426) = $6000 \* 0.8574 = $5144.40

I am getting a very small amount in round 4, while Bob is doing much better. I am at risk of getting nothing, so I have to keep playing.

I will **reject** this offer.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5, considering the continued inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains:

*   **My Gain (Alice):** $3500, but worth 67.23% less, so $3500 \* (1 - 0.6723) = $3500 \* 0.3277 = $1146.95
*   **Bob's Gain:** $6500, but worth 22.62% less, so $6500 \* (1 - 0.2262) = $6500 \* 0.7738 = $5039.70

I'm getting very little in this round, less than $1200 in real value, while bob still gets a significant amount. We are getting closer to the deadline of 12 rounds. I'll take the chance and make a better offer next round if I have the opportunity.

I will **reject** this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 7:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
