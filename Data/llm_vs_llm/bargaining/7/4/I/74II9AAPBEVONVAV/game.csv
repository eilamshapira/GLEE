30.0,70.0,"This round I get to propose, and while I think splitting evenly is fair in principle, the inflation hits you harder Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor to try and offset that difference.  Think about it - taking a smaller share now might be better than risking even less next round.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering a 40/60 split. Considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree on a deal sooner rather than later.",Alice,3,
