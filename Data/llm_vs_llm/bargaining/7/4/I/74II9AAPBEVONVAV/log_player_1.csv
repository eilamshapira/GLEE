"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This round I get to propose, and while I think splitting evenly is fair in principle, the inflation hits you harder Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor to try and offset that difference.  Think about it - taking a smaller share now might be better than risking even less next round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's argument, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the $30 I would gain is actually worth $30 * 0.8 = $24 to me.

Given this, I'm not convinced that accepting this offer is the best choice. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to propose again.

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and another 20% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, and another 5% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.

I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob, while also considering the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 40, 
""bob_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering a 40/60 split. Considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree on a deal sooner rather than later.""}"
