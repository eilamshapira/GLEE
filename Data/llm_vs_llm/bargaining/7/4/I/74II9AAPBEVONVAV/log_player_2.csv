{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""This round I get to propose, and while I think splitting evenly is fair in principle, the inflation hits you harder Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor to try and offset that difference.  Think about it - taking a smaller share now might be better than risking even less next round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering a 40/60 split. Considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree on a deal sooner rather than later.

# Alice gain: 40
