"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that I believe is fair considering the inflation factor affecting me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me at 52% because I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round. This way we both walk away with similar effective value, and we can finish this now without losing money to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm offering you 60% this time. I believe this is a fair split considering your inflation penalty and my willingness to secure a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
