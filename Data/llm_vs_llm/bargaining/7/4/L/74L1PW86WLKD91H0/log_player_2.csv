"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me at 52% because I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round. This way we both walk away with similar effective value, and we can finish this now without losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
