0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob – I understand that you’re in a very strong position since future rounds only hurt my position (the value of money for me drops by 10% each round, while yours remains intact). To avoid unnecessary delay and to respect that fact, I’m offering you the full million dollars now. I believe you know that if we wait, you can secure nearly the same by proposing next round, so I hope you’ll accept this offer and end the game immediately.",Alice,1,
