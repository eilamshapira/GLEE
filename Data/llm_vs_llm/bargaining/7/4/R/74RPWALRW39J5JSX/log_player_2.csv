"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I understand that you’re in a very strong position since future rounds only hurt my position (the value of money for me drops by 10% each round, while yours remains intact). To avoid unnecessary delay and to respect that fact, I’m offering you the full million dollars now. I believe you know that if we wait, you can secure nearly the same by proposing next round, so I hope you’ll accept this offer and end the game immediately. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Alice's offer. She correctly assessed the situation - I'm in a strong position due to the asymmetric inflation effect, and she's offering me the maximum possible amount. There's no reason to reject this as I cannot get more than $1,000,000, and prolonging the game would only decrease the total value available to divide due to Alice's inflation penalty."
