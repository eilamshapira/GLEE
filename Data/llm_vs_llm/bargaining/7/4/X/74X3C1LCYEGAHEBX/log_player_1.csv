"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, keeping in mind the 5% inflation penalty per round if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer where I get slightly more than half, but Bob still gets a substantial amount. I'm offering this split because I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. My original offer was 5500 for me, which Bob rejected
2. Bob now offers me 4700
3. Due to inflation, 4700 in this round is actually worth 4700 * 0.95 = 4465 to me
4. If I reject and we continue, future rounds will be worth even less to me
5. Bob's counter-offer isn't extremely unfair, though it's tilted in his favor

While I could reject and try for a better deal, the inflation penalty makes prolonged negotiation costly for me. This offer, while not ideal, is reasonable enough given the circumstances.
