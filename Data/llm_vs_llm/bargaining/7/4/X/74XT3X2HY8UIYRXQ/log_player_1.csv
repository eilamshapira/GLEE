Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm suggesting a more balanced split. While you don't face inflation, I lose 20% value per round, which puts significant pressure on me. This offer gives you the majority while still allowing me a fair share. Let's finish this now so we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
