"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, my money would be worth 20% less, meaning I'd need to get more than $3,750 in the next round just to equal the $3,000 now. Plus, Alice could reject my offer, leading to further inflation penalties for me.

While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, the inflation pressure on me makes it worth considering. However, I believe I can negotiate for a somewhat better deal without risking too much to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will likely accept, considering the inflation penalty I face if we continue to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm suggesting a more balanced split. While you don't face inflation, I lose 20% value per round, which puts significant pressure on me. This offer gives you the majority while still allowing me a fair share. Let's finish this now so we both benefit.""}"
