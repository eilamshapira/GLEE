5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but a 60/40 split in your favor isn't fair considering I'm the one facing guaranteed inflation penalties. I'm making a more balanced offer that better accounts for my inflation risk. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - you from potential future concessions and me from inflation. This is a win-win proposition.",Alice,3,
