"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation penalty that affects me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is a fair split that saves us both from losing value through negotiations.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but this is a one-time split. Let's be fair and split it 60/40. This is a good deal for both of us, and avoids further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more compelling offer considering the increasing inflation pressure.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but a 60/40 split in your favor isn't fair considering I'm the one facing guaranteed inflation penalties. I'm making a more balanced offer that better accounts for my inflation risk. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - you from potential future concessions and me from inflation. This is a win-win proposition.""
