"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is a fair split that saves us both from losing value through negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but this is a one-time split. Let's be fair and split it 60/40. This is a good deal for both of us, and avoids further losses due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but a 60/40 split in your favor isn't fair considering I'm the one facing guaranteed inflation penalties. I'm making a more balanced offer that better accounts for my inflation risk. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - you from potential future concessions and me from inflation. This is a win-win proposition. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
