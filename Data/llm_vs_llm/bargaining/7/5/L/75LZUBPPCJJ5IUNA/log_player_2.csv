"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly at $5000 each. Fair and square to both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation effect, I need to consider the diminishing value of money in future rounds. If I reject this offer, the $10,000 will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning I'd need to get more than $5,000/(0.8) = $6,250 in the next round to be better off.

This is a fair first offer at 50/50, and by accepting now I get full value without inflation. If I reject, I risk getting less overall value due to inflation, even if I secure a larger nominal amount in later rounds.
