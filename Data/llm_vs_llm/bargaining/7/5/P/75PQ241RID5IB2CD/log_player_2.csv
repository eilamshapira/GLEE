Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 387500 
# Alice gain: 612500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $387,500 I would gain is worth approximately $315,625 in the original value (1 - 0.19 = 0.81, then 387500 * 0.81). 

Given this, I'll evaluate the offer.
