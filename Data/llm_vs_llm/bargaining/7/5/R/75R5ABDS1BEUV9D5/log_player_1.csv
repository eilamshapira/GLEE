"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the money with Bob in Round 1, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 20% inflation for me each round, delaying will significantly reduce the value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Considering the inflation you mentioned, it might be wise to settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
