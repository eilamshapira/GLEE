"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 20% inflation for me each round, delaying will significantly reduce the value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
