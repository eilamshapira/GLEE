5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split the money evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both face our respective inflation rates fairly on an equal share.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Given that we're now in round 3, my inflation rate of 10% has impacted me more than your 5% rate. This split of $5800/$4200 fairly compensates for our different inflation rates and the time that has passed. Let's agree and not lose more value to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,I understand the impact of inflation on both sides. I propose $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This recognizes your higher inflation rate while keeping the split closer to even.,Bob,4,
