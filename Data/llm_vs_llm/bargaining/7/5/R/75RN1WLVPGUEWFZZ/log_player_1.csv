Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get $4,500, I get $5,500 to compensate for my higher inflation rate of 10%.""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both face our respective inflation rates fairly on an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The even split doesn't account for my higher inflation rate, and since this is round 2, my share would actually be worth even less due to my 10% inflation rate compared to Bob's 5%. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for these differences."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given that we're now in round 3, my inflation rate of 10% has impacted me more than your 5% rate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation on both sides. I propose $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This recognizes your higher inflation rate while keeping the split closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the increasing inflation penalties are becoming significant (I'm already losing 27.1% to inflation). Bob's offer of $5200 acknowledges my higher inflation rate, and continuing to negotiate further rounds would result in both of us losing more value. This is a reasonable compromise."
