"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces steeper inflation penalties (20% vs my 5% per round). I'll propose a somewhat favorable split for myself but not too extreme to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. I believe it's a reasonable opening offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the different inflation rates."
