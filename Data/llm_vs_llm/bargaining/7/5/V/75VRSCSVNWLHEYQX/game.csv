48.72,51.28,"Hello Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer. Considering that if you wait you'll have the advantage in the next round but at a 5% inflation cost, I believe this division is fair for both of us. You receive $48.72 and I get $51.28â€”a split that reflects the bargaining positions and the discounting effect. I hope you agree to secure our earnings now before further inflation hits.",Bob,2,
