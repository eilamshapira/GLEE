"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 while you get $40. This way, both of us benefit reasonably before inflation kicks in. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer. Considering that if you wait you'll have the advantage in the next round but at a 5% inflation cost, I believe this division is fair for both of us. You receive $48.72 and I get $51.28â€”a split that reflects the bargaining positions and the discounting effect. I hope you agree to secure our earnings now before further inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 48.72 
# Bob gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
