"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 while you get $40. This way, both of us benefit reasonably before inflation kicks in. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51.28, ""alice_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer. Considering that if you wait you'll have the advantage in the next round but at a 5% inflation cost, I believe this division is fair for both of us. You receive $48.72 and I get $51.28â€”a split that reflects the bargaining positions and the discounting effect. I hope you agree to secure our earnings now before further inflation hits.""}"
