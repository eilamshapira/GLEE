"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. With inflation affecting me 5% each round, it's beneficial for both of us to agree quickly rather than letting the total value diminish.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your concern about inflation, I propose a fair 50-50 split to conclude the deal quickly and avoid any further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
