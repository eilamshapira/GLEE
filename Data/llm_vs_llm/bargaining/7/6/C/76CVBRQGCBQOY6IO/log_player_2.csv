"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. A fair deal given the inflation I'm facing! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of the total)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less (so any amount I get will effectively be worth only 80% of its current value)
   * 4000$ now is better than 5000$ in the next round (which would be worth 4000$ due to inflation)

While 40% might seem low at first glance, given the 20% inflation penalty for waiting, accepting this offer is actually rational. If I reject, any better deal I might negotiate would be significantly devalued by inflation.
