55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Since money devalues by 10% for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. This 55/45 split is fair considering the time-value difference of our money.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,Hi Alice! Let's keep things fair and split it evenly at 50/50. I think this is a fair approach for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I rejected your 50/50 offer because it doesn't account for the inflation you face. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less (20% less than round 1). This 60/40 split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting further, since your $40 now is worth more than potentially getting $50 in a future round with 30% or more inflation.",Alice,3,
