"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair and reasonable offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since money devalues by 10% for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. This 55/45 split is fair considering the time-value difference of our money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's keep things fair and split it evenly at 50/50. I think this is a fair approach for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, I rejected your 50/50 offer because it doesn't account for the inflation you face. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less (20% less than round 1). This 60/40 split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting further, since your $40 now is worth more than potentially getting $50 in a future round with 30% or more inflation.""}"
