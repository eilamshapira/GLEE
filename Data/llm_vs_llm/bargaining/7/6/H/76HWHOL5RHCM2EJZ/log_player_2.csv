"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since money devalues by 10% for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. This 55/45 split is fair considering the time-value difference of our money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice! Let's keep things fair and split it evenly at 50/50. I think this is a fair approach for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your 50/50 offer because it doesn't account for the inflation you face. If we go another round, your money will be worth even less (20% less than round 1). This 60/40 split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting further, since your $40 now is worth more than potentially getting $50 in a future round with 30% or more inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
