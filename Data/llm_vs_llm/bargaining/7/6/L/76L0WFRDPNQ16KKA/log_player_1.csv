"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that acknowledges the potential impact of inflation if negotiations extend further.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to secure a slightly larger portion given that I know my money will lose 10% value each round if Bob declines. The offer still gives Bob a substantial amount and should be appealing enough to accept rather than risk further negotiations where both of us might lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $480,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $432,000
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
- My original offer was rejected, suggesting Bob is willing to negotiate hard
- The current split is relatively close to 50-50
- Further rounds will continue to erode my purchasing power

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty affecting me, I should accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split, and continuing negotiations would likely lead to diminishing returns for me due to inflation.
