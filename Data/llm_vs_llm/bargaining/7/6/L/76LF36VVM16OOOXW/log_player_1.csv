"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take $99 and you get $1. Consider that if you decline and become the proposer in the next round, your money will be worth 10% lessâ€”and you'll have to give me almost 100% of the full-value money to convince me to accept. This deal, though uneven, is better for you than risking a worse outcome later. What do you say?""}"
