"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take $99 and you get $1. Consider that if you decline and become the proposer in the next round, your money will be worth 10% lessâ€”and you'll have to give me almost 100% of the full-value money to convince me to accept. This deal, though uneven, is better for you than risking a worse outcome later. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
