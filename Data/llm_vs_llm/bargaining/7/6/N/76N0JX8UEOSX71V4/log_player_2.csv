"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, the nominal amount is still $10,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount. I'll propose a 50-50 split, but since I want to incentivize Alice to accept, I'll give her a slightly larger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6666.67 
# Alice gain: 3333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $6666.67 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $4266.67.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is more reasonable this time.
