"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that every round we delay costs me 5% in value while you aren’t affected at all, I recognize that if you wait, you can nearly guarantee yourself the entire pot. Therefore, to keep things efficient and avoid the inevitable discounting loss on my side, I’m offering you the full $1000000 now. I hope you’ll accept this offer and we can both walk away immediately. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
