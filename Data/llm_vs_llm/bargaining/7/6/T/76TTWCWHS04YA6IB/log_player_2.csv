"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
1. I get to make the proposal
2. Alice's money will be worth 20% less to her
3. My money retains full value

In the next round, I could propose a split that takes advantage of the 20% devaluation for Alice. Since $60 would only be worth $48 to her then, I could likely negotiate a better deal for myself.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money is now worth 20% less to her, I can use this to make a strategic offer.

For Alice, each dollar is now only worth $0.80. I should propose a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice given this devaluation.

If I propose taking $70 and leaving $30 for Alice, that $30 would actually be worth $24 to her (due to 20% devaluation). This might be too aggressive and risk rejection.

I'll propose a more moderate split that still improves my position but remains acceptable:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This gives me $55, and Alice gets $45 (which is worth $36 to her due to the 20% devaluation). This is still better for me than her initial offer of $40, while being reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further devaluation."
