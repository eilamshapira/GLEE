"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. Since neither of us faces inflation, an equal division seems most reasonable. This way we both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing after 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split, but I know I face 20% inflation each round while her inflation situation is unknown to me. This means that $500,000 now is worth more to me than potentially more money in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the value will already be decreased for me due to inflation. And if we go through multiple rounds, the total value could diminish significantly.
