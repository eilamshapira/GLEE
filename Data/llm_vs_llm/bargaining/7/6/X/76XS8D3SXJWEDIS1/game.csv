700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the money reasonably. I propose 700000 for me and 300000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk further depreciation of the money's value for you in later rounds.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is possible. I propose we take 600000 each, ensuring fairness while acknowledging the potential for further devaluation.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fairer split, but the longer we wait, the less your share is worth. I'm willing to come down to 650000 for me and 350000 for you. This is my best offer, and it still gives you a substantial amount, especially considering the ongoing devaluation for you. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,3,
