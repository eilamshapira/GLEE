Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money reasonably. I propose 700,000 for me and 300,000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk further depreciation of the money's value for you in later rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is possible. I propose we take 600000 each, ensuring fairness while acknowledging the potential for further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is my best offer, and it still gives you a substantial amount, especially considering the ongoing devaluation for you. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good amount.""
