"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money reasonably. I propose 700000 for me and 300000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk further depreciation of the money's value for you in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fairer split, but the longer we wait, the less your share is worth. I'm willing to come down to 650000 for me and 350000 for you. This is my best offer, and it still gives you a substantial amount, especially considering the ongoing devaluation for you. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
