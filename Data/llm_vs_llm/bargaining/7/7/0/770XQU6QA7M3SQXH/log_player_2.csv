Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, how about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor? This slightly adjusts for the inflation but is closer to an even split. Let's aim to wrap this up before more value is lost. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
