"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll offer a division that's fair but recognizes the inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty each round, so reaching an agreement quickly is in my interest. I'm offering you a substantial portion (45%) while keeping a bit more for myself to offset the potential inflation loss if we need multiple rounds. This is a reasonable first offer that balances our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob and I have different inflation rates - mine is 20% per round while his is 10% per round. This means delays hurt me more than they hurt him, but we both lose value by prolonging negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfectly equal split, which is the fairest solution. With my higher inflation rate, I need to reach an agreement soon, and a 50-50 split is a principled compromise that respects both our interests. This balanced approach should allow us to conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation further erodes our gains."
