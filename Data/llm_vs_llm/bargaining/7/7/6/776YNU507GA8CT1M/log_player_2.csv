"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Alice's even split offer is better than rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me. So if I were to get the entire $10,000 in the next round (unrealistic), it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

An even split is fair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky for me.
