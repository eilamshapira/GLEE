"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly favorable offer for myself.

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which gives me a bit more while still being fair enough that Bob might accept."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll move towards a more equal split to increase chances of acceptance.

I'm offering a slightly more balanced distribution, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a small advantage."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're both moving towards the middle, I'll propose an even split to try to reach an agreement.

A 50-50 split is completely fair to both parties, and we should try to avoid risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
