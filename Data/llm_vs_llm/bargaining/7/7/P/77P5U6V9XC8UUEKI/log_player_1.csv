"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value at 5% per round, while Bob's loses value at 10% per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because we both face inflation, but Bob's is higher, so he has more incentive to finish the game early. We both win by accepting a reasonable deal now rather than dragging this out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is looking for an even split, but I need to consider our different inflation rates. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still accounting for the fact that Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split. This is a fair compromise that recognizes our different situations with inflation. Since Bob loses 10% value per round compared to my 5%, reaching an agreement sooner benefits both of us, but especially Bob. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal while still reflecting our different positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob has now asked for more than 50% of the split. Given that we're already in round 5 and the inflation is significantly affecting both of us (my money has lost 14.26% value and Bob's has lost 27.1%), I'll propose a more moderate offer to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, 
""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing a 51-49 split in my favor. This is very close to an even split while still acknowledging my slight advantage in terms of inflation rate. At this point, continuing to negotiate is hurting both of us, but especially Bob due to his higher inflation rate. This fair offer should help us conclude the game and maximize our collective outcome."
