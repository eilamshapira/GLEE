"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 20% inflation penalty per round for me, waiting would mean:
- Round 1: $500,000 (current offer)
- Round 2: I could offer something, but any counter would be worth 20% less to me
- Future rounds: Increasingly less valuable due to compounding inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the even split is fair and the inflation risk makes waiting costly for me. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in round 2, and I'd already be losing value.
