"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the asymmetric inflation effect.

Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I face 0%, Bob has more incentive to accept an offer now rather than waiting. If we go to additional rounds, the total value for Bob decreases significantly.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that waiting would be costly for him. The $400,000 Bob would receive now is worth more to him than potentially getting more in later rounds when inflation will have reduced its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a revised offer that better accounts for our relative positions.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000}

Given that Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I don't experience any inflation, his 350,000 now is worth more to him than waiting for another round where that same amount would be worth even less. At this point, Bob has already lost significant value due to the 20% inflation after round 1. If we continue to another round, his position will weaken further with another 20% reduction in value. This split offers him substantial value while acknowledging our asymmetric inflation situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
