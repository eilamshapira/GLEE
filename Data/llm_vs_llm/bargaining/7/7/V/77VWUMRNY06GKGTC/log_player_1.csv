"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly to avoid getting nothing.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to get the most out of this deal and the inflation is looming. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000 (which maintains its full value for me)
2. He wants $550,000 (which is worth 5% less to him now, so effectively $522,500 for him)
3. If I reject, we move to round 3, where I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. We have 10 more rounds left, but risking getting nothing if we don't agree
5. $450,000 is still a significant amount, and accepting now ensures we both get something
