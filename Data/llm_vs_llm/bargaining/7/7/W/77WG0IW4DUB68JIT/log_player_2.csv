"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to remember that my money will be worth 10% less due to inflation (while Alice doesn't face this penalty). So the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less due to inflation, and considering the risk that Alice might make even less favorable offers in future rounds, I think I should accept this initial offer.
