Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it seems Bob is being quite greedy. I need to balance getting a decent amount with the risk of further inflation. Remember, my money is now worth 20% less *again* compared to round 2 (and 40% less than round 1).
