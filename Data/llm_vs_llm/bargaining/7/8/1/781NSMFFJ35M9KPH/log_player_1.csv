"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $380,000.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3). So, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.
