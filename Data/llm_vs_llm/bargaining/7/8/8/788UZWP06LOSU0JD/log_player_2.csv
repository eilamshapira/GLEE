"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $300,000 for me, $700,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, in the next round:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * This means any amount I get next round is effectively reduced by 20%

The maximum I could reasonably expect to get next round would be around $600,000, but after the 20% reduction, that would be worth $480,000 to me. And Alice might reject that offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more value decay.

$300,000 now is better than a risky higher amount that would be worth less due to inflation.
