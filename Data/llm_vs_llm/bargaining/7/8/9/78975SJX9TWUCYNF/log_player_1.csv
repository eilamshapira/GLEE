"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm playing as Alice and need to consider the 20% depreciation per round, I should make a compelling first offer to avoid going to further rounds where my share would be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob might accept it. If Bob rejects this offer, in the next round my money will be worth 20% less, so I need to make this first offer attractive enough to both parties."
