"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers both fairness and the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because we both deserve a fair share, but I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. By taking slightly more than half, I'm protecting myself from losing value while still giving you a substantial portion."
