"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- I'm offered $45 while Alice gets $55
- If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round when I make an offer
- $45 now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a 20% reduced pot
- Even if I propose a better split next round, Alice might reject and we'd lose more value

While not perfectly equal, this is a reasonable offer that gives me a substantial portion. Given the inflation penalty, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation.
