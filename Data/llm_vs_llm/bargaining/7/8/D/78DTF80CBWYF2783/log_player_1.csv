"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good outcome, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to equal while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. It's reasonable enough that Bob should accept it rather than risk the 5% inflation penalty by rejecting and counter-offering."
