"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* I'm being offered $4,800 out of $10,000
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $9,500
* Maximum I could get next round is $9,500, but Alice would likely reject that

The current offer gives me 48% of the total, which is fairly close to an even split. While slightly in Alice's favor, rejecting would mean losing $500 in total value. Making up that difference would be difficult.
