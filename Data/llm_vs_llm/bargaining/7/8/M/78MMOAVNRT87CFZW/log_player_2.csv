"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $640,000 in the first round's value (since it's 36% less, 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, so 450000 / 0.64 ≈ 703125, but I will use the 640000 for simplicity), and the $550,000 Alice would gain is worth approximately $680,000 in the first round's value (since it's 19% less, 1 - 0.19 = 0.81, so 550000 / 0.81 ≈ 680000 for simplicity, but using the actual value 550000 * 0.81 = 445500 and then 550000 is 1 and 445500 is 0.81, so 1 / 0.81 = 1.2345 and 550000 * 1.2345 = 679250).

However, I must consider that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.
