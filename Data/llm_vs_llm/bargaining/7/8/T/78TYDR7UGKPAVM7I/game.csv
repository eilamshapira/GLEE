525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I need to reject a 50/50 split because I face 5% inflation each round while you don't. This means in real value, a 50/50 split actually gives me less than you. My current offer accounts for approximately 2 rounds of inflation I've already experienced. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to maintain fairness due to the increasing inflation penalty I face. Let's settle now.",Alice,3,
