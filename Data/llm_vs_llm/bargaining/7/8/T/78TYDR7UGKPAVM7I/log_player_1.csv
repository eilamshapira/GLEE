Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000

My current offer accounts for approximately 2 rounds of inflation I've already experienced. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to maintain fairness due to the increasing inflation penalty I face. Let's settle now.""}"
