"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, this split is actually quite fair. If we delay, my share becomes worth less while yours doesn't. Let's settle this now so we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to reject a 50/50 split because I face 5% inflation each round while you don't. This means in real value, a 50/50 split actually gives me less than you. My current offer accounts for approximately 2 rounds of inflation I've already experienced. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to maintain fairness due to the increasing inflation penalty I face. Let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
