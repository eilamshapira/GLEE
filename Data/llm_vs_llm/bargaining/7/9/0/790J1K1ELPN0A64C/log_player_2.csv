"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, if I reject, the money will be worth:
   - 5% less for me (still worth 9,500$ in total)
   - 10% less for Alice (worth only 9,000$ for her)
3. This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round, as Alice has more to lose from delays.
4. We still have 11 rounds left, so there's plenty of room for negotiation.

Given this analysis, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice has more to lose from delays (10% vs my 5%), and she made a fair initial offer, I'll propose a split slightly in my favor but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning: With the 10% depreciation for Alice, the total amount is now worth only 9000$ to her, so getting 4500$ now is still better than risking further depreciation. For me, this is a better deal than the initial 50-50 split, but not so extreme that it's likely to be rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me 5300$, which after 9.75% inflation is worth approximately 4783$ to me
2. Her previous rejection of my 5500/4500 split shows she's willing to negotiate
3. The inflation is hitting her harder (19% vs 9.75% for me)
4. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be about 15%
   - Her inflation will be about 29%
   - The gap between our inflation rates is widening
5. However, her current offer is already better than her initial 50-50 split
6. The offer is reasonable given the current inflation levels

Given that she's made a solid counteroffer and further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
