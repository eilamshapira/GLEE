"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $500000 each. Given that each additional round costs me 5% in value, settling now ensures we both secure a fair share without delay. I trust you'll agree this is a sound move for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. Each round costs me 5% in value due to inflation.
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - Alice might reject my offer
   - My money will be worth 5% less (475,000$ value for my share)
   - We risk losing more value in subsequent rounds
4. Getting $500,000 right now is a solid offer
5. Even if I tried to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty might eat into any gains

The 50-50 split is fair, and the inflation risk makes accepting now the most rational choice.
