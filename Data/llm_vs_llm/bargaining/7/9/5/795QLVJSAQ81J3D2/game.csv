5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 equally—$5000 each. Since the value of the money decreases by 10% for me with every delay, it makes sense to agree now rather than risk losing value in later rounds. I believe this fair division benefits us both. What do you say?",Alice,1,

800.0,9200.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate the urgency regarding inflation. However, as we move into round 2, waiting further would cost you an extra 10% loss in value per round. In light of that, I propose that I take $9200 while you receive $800 now—this is better for you than the risk of an even lower outcome if we delay further. Let’s agree quickly and avoid more loss.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your point about inflation. Given that any delay would cost me even more value, I believe that accepting your current proposal is in my best interest. I’ll take the $800 offer as it’s better than risking a near-zero outcome in subsequent rounds.",Alice,2,accept
