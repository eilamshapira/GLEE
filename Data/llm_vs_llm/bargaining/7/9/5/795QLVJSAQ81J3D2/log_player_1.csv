"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10,000 equally—$5,000 each. Since the value of the money decreases by 10% for me with every delay, it makes sense to agree now rather than risk losing value in later rounds. I believe this fair division benefits us both. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the urgency regarding inflation. However, as we move into round 2, waiting further would cost you an extra 10% loss in value per round. In light of that, I propose that I take $9200 while you receive $800 now—this is better for you than the risk of an even lower outcome if we delay further. Let’s agree quickly and avoid more loss. 
# Alice gain: 800 
# Bob gain: 9200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your point about inflation. Given that any delay would cost me even more value, I believe that accepting your current proposal is in my best interest. I’ll take the $800 offer as it’s better than risking a near-zero outcome in subsequent rounds.""}"
