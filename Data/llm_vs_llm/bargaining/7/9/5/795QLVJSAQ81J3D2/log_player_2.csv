"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 equally—$5000 each. Since the value of the money decreases by 10% for me with every delay, it makes sense to agree now rather than risk losing value in later rounds. I believe this fair division benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9200, ""alice_gain"": 800, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the urgency regarding inflation. However, as we move into round 2, waiting further would cost you an extra 10% loss in value per round. In light of that, I propose that I take $9,200 while you receive $800 now—this is better for you than the risk of an even lower outcome if we delay further. Let’s agree quickly and avoid more loss.""}"
