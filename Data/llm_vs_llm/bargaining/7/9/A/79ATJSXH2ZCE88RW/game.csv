8500.0,1500.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for an immediate agreement: I would take $8500, and you would receive $1500. Given that with every round the value of the money drops—only 5% for me but 20% for you—I believe settling now is in both our best interests. Accepting today avoids unnecessary loss of value, and while the split may seem tilted, it reflects the harsher depreciation you face if we delay. Let’s make this work now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but it wasn't fair. This round, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the money is depreciating, it's important to be fair.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Hi Bob, considering the steep depreciation you face (a 20% drop per round), waiting further will cost you significantly. In round 3, I’m proposing that I take $9000 and you get $1000. With the current round’s 10% depreciation on my side and 40% on yours, your immediate effective payoff is about $600. If you wait for round 4, as proposer, you’d be in an even tougher spot due to a 60% nominal depreciation on your share, which would leave you with even less. I believe this offer reflects a fair balance given our different inflation rates. Let’s settle now before more value slips away.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I understand your desire to get a bigger share, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point. It's a compromise, but it ensures we both get a reasonable amount. Let's avoid further losses and agree on this.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while a 50/50 split might seem fair, it's important to consider how our respective depreciation rates affect the real value of our shares. My effective value with $5000 in this round is about $4287, while your $5000 is effectively around $2560. Given that my share loses only 5% per round compared to your 20%, I believe that by moving to the next round, I will be in an even stronger position to propose a division that maximizes my benefit while offering you just enough to make acceptance appealing based on your future prospects. Therefore, I must decline your 50/50 offer and suggest we continue this negotiation.",Alice,4,reject
8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, in this round both of us are facing a decline in value—my share at about 81.45% of nominal and yours at 40.96%. Considering that if you reject now you become the proposer in round 6, your effective discount factor will be 0.8 (since 0.8^5/0.8^4 = 0.8) while mine would be 0.95 (0.95^5/0.95^4 = 0.95). In a standard alternating-offers framework, this gives me, as the proposer in round 5, an equilibrium advantage leading to a split where I get roughly 83.33% and you about 16.67% of the nominal $10000. That translates to 8333 for me and 1667 for you. This offer is designed so that your immediate effective payout (1667 × 0.4096 ≈ $683) matches what you’d expect to achieve if you waited until round 6. I hope you see that accepting now avoids further losses and is in both our best interests.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end. We're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor, but I need a fair share to make this worthwhile.  If we don't agree soon, we'll both get nothing.  Let's compromise and come to an agreement before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the urgency, but your offer gives me an effective payoff of about $4643 after discount—which, given our respective inflation rates, is less than what I expect to secure as the proposer in the next round. With each round passing, your money loses value far more rapidly than mine. In round 7, when I get to propose, I’ll be in a much stronger position to extract a more favorable division that reflects the steep depreciation you face. I must therefore reject your current offer and look forward to proposing terms that better capitalize on our respective discount factors.",Alice,6,reject
8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 7, our future discount rates remain crucial. My money now is worth about 73.5% of its nominal value, while yours is only about 26.2%. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 8, but moving one round ahead will cost you an extra reduction (from 0.2621 to 0.2097), leaving you effectively no better off. In the standard Rubinstein bargaining setup, with my one‐round discount factor at 0.95 and yours at 0.80, the equilibrium split when I’m the proposer is approximately 83.33% for me and 16.67% for you. Thus, I propose a division of $10000 where I receive $8333 and you receive $1667. Accepting now secures you an effective payoff equal to what you’d obtain by waiting. Let’s agree on this to avoid further losses.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  We're both losing a significant amount with every round.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in your favor. It's a generous offer considering the situation. We need to reach an agreement now, or we risk losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the offer—it’s generous on the face of it. However, even though your proposal gives me a nominal 70% (i.e. $7000), after the 30.17% depreciation it only translates into roughly $4888 for me. Given our very different discount rates—the fact that your money is eroding much faster—and that I’ll be the proposer next round, I’m confident I can structure a proposal that yields me a higher effective value despite further depreciation. In short, by waiting I can leverage my comparatively slower loss of value, and I expect the continuation value (my best alternative in round 9) to exceed what I’d get by accepting now. For these reasons, I must reject your offer, and I propose we continue to round 9.",Alice,8,reject
3517.0,6483.0,"Hi Bob, in round 9 my money is worth 66.34% of its nominal value while yours is only 16.78%. If you reject my offer, you'll be the proposer in round 10, but you'll then face a further drop—yielding an effective value of roughly $1087. To make you just as well off today, I'm offering you a nominal $6483 (which amounts to about $1088 effectively) and I keep $3517 (worth about $2333 effectively). This division meets your continuation value exactly, so there's no benefit to delaying further. I hope you agree that locking in these amounts now minimizes our losses as we approach the final rounds.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, we're in the final stretch. I understand you want a bigger share, but we need to compromise. If we don't agree now, we might get nothing. I'm offering you 80% and keeping 20% for myself. It's the best I can do at this point. Let's end this game with a fair agreement.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, thank you for your offer. Under the current conditions, my nominal share of $8000 translates to an effective value of about 0.6302 × $8000 ≈ $5042, which more than compensates for any potential gains I might secure by waiting another round. Given that further delay would only exacerbate our losses—especially on your side with an 86.58% reduction—I believe accepting the 80/20 split now is the best outcome for both of us. Let's settle this and avoid additional depreciation.",Alice,10,accept
