Accepting today avoids unnecessary loss of value, and while the split may seem tilted, it reflects the harsher depreciation you face if we delay. Let’s make this work now!""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but it wasn't fair. This round, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the money is depreciating, it's important to be fair.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 3

In round 3, I’m proposing that I take $9,000 and you get $1,000. With the current round’s 10% depreciation on my side and 40% on yours, your immediate effective payoff is about $600. If you wait for round 4, as proposer, you’d be in an even tougher spot due to a 60% nominal depreciation on your share, which would leave you with even less. I believe this offer reflects a fair balance given our different inflation rates. Let’s settle now before more value slips away.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I understand your desire to get a bigger share, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point. It's a compromise, but it ensures we both get a reasonable amount. Let's avoid further losses and agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while a 50/50 split might seem fair, it's important to consider how our respective depreciation rates affect the real value of our shares. My effective value with $5,000 in this round is about $4,287, while your $5,000 is effectively around $2,560. Given that my share loses only 5% per round compared to your 20%, I believe that by moving to the next round, I will be in an even stronger position to propose a division that maximizes my benefit while offering you just enough to make acceptance appealing based on your future prospects. Therefore, I must decline your 50/50 offer and suggest we continue this negotiation.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round both of us are facing a decline in value—my share at about 81.45% of nominal and yours at 40.96%. Considering that if you reject now you become the proposer in round 6, your effective discount factor will be 0.8 (since 0.8^5/0.8^4 = 0.8) while mine would be 0.95 (0.95^5/0.95^4 = 0.95). In a standard alternating-offers framework, this gives me, as the proposer in round 5, an equilibrium advantage leading to a split where I get roughly 83.33% and you about 16.67% of the nominal $10,000. That translates to 8333 for me and 1667 for you. This offer is designed so that your immediate effective payout (1667 × 0.4096 ≈ $683) matches what you’d expect to achieve if you waited until round 6. I hope you see that accepting now avoids further losses and is in both our best interests.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end. We're both losing money with each passing round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the urgency, but your offer gives me an effective payoff of about $4,643 after discount—which, given our respective inflation rates, is less than what I expect to secure as the proposer in the next round. With each round passing, your money loses value far more rapidly than mine. In round 7, when I get to propose, I’ll be in a much stronger position to extract a more favorable division that reflects the steep depreciation you face. I must therefore reject your current offer and look forward to proposing terms that better capitalize on our respective discount factors.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we enter round 7, our future discount rates remain crucial. My money now is worth about 73.5% of its nominal value, while yours is only about 26.2%. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 8, but moving one round ahead will cost you an extra reduction (from 0.2621 to 0.2097), leaving you effectively no better off. In the standard Rubinstein bargaining setup, with my one‐round discount factor at 0.95 and yours at 0.80, the equilibrium split when I’m the proposer is approximately 83.33% for me and 16.67% for you. Thus, I propose a division of $10,000 where I receive $8,333 and you receive $1,667. Accepting now secures you an effective payoff equal to what you’d obtain by waiting. Let’s agree on this to avoid further losses.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  We're both losing a significant amount with every round.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in your favor. It's a generous offer considering the situation. We need to reach an agreement now, or we risk losing everything.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer—it’s generous on the face of it. However, even though your proposal gives me a nominal 70% (i.e. $7,000), after the 30.17% depreciation it only translates into roughly $4,888 for me. Given our very different discount rates—the fact that your money is eroding much faster—and that I’ll be the proposer next round, I’m confident I can structure a proposal that yields me a higher effective value despite further depreciation. In short, by waiting I can leverage my comparatively slower loss of value, and I expect the continuation value (my best alternative in round 9) to exceed what I’d get by accepting now. For these reasons, I must reject your offer, and I propose we continue to round 9.""}"

To make you just as well off today, I'm offering you a nominal $6,483 (which amounts to about $1,088 effectively) and I keep $3,517 (worth about $2,333 effectively). This division meets your continuation value exactly, so there's no benefit to delaying further.
