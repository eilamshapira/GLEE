"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for an immediate agreement: I would take $8500, and you would receive $1500. Given that with every round the value of the money drops—only 5% for me but 20% for you—I believe settling now is in both our best interests. Accepting today avoids unnecessary loss of value, and while the split may seem tilted, it reflects the harsher depreciation you face if we delay. Let’s make this work now! 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the steep depreciation you face (a 20% drop per round), waiting further will cost you significantly. In round 3, I’m proposing that I take $9000 and you get $1000. With the current round’s 10% depreciation on my side and 40% on yours, your immediate effective payoff is about $600. If you wait for round 4, as proposer, you’d be in an even tougher spot due to a 60% nominal depreciation on your share, which would leave you with even less. I believe this offer reflects a fair balance given our different inflation rates. Let’s settle now before more value slips away. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round both of us are facing a decline in value—my share at about 81.45% of nominal and yours at 40.96%. Considering that if you reject now you become the proposer in round 6, your effective discount factor will be 0.8 (since 0.8^5/0.8^4 = 0.8) while mine would be 0.95 (0.95^5/0.95^4 = 0.95). In a standard alternating-offers framework, this gives me, as the proposer in round 5, an equilibrium advantage leading to a split where I get roughly 83.33% and you about 16.67% of the nominal $10000. That translates to 8333 for me and 1667 for you. This offer is designed so that your immediate effective payout (1667 × 0.4096 ≈ $683) matches what you’d expect to achieve if you waited until round 6. I hope you see that accepting now avoids further losses and is in both our best interests.

Let's compromise and come to an agreement before it's too late.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 7, our future discount rates remain crucial. My money now is worth about 73.5% of its nominal value, while yours is only about 26.2%. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 8, but moving one round ahead will cost you an extra reduction (from 0.2621 to 0.2097), leaving you effectively no better off. In the standard Rubinstein bargaining setup, with my one‐round discount factor at 0.95 and yours at 0.80, the equilibrium split when I’m the proposer is approximately 83.33% for me and 16.67% for you. Thus, I propose a division of $10000 where I receive $8333 and you receive $1667. Accepting now secures you an effective payoff equal to what you’d obtain by waiting. Let’s agree on this to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 9 my money is worth 66.34% of its nominal value while yours is only 16.78%. If you reject my offer, you'll be the proposer in round 10, but you'll then face a further drop—yielding an effective value of roughly $1087. To make you just as well off today, I'm offering you a nominal $6483 (which amounts to about $1088 effectively) and I keep $3517 (worth about $2333 effectively). This division meets your continuation value exactly, so there's no benefit to delaying further. I hope you agree that locking in these amounts now minimizes our losses as we approach the final rounds.
