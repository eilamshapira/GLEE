"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. However, I also want to be fair to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```
This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
400000 * 0.8 = 320000

Considering this, Bob's offer doesn't seem very appealing to me, as I'd be getting less than half of the original amount in value.

My response:
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original amount (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2, cumulative effect: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

To make a deal, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value for me. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to incentivize him to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}
```
This offer gives me a larger share than Bob's previous offer, but still considers the decreasing value due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation (20% less in Round 1, 20% less in Round 2, and approximately 20% less in Round 3, cumulative effect: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512), the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
380000 * 0.512 = 194560

Considering this, Bob's offer seems even less appealing than before. I'd be getting less than 20% of the original amount in value.

My response:
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth approximately 59.4% less than the original amount (cumulative effect: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096).

To make a deal, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value for me. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to incentivize him to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 5:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}
```
This offer gives Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a significant portion of the original amount. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
320000 * 0.3277 = 104,816

Considering this, Bob's offer seems very unappealing. I'd be getting less than 11% of the original amount in value.

However, I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease for me if I reject this offer. If I reject, the value will decrease by another 20% in the next round.

My response:
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth approximately 75.23% less than the original amount (cumulative effect).

To make a deal, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value for me. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to incentivize him to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 7:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 280000, ""bob_gain"": 720000}
```
This offer gives Bob an even larger share, but I'm still trying to get a significant portion of the original amount. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer, given the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 79.03% less due to inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
250000 * 0.2097 = 52,425

Considering this, Bob's offer seems extremely unappealing. I'd be getting less than 5.5% of the original amount in value.

However, I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease for me if I reject this offer. If I reject, the value will decrease by another 20% in the next round, making it even more unfavorable for me.

At this point, I'm starting to think that accepting a bad offer might be better than risking getting nothing or an even worse offer in the next rounds.

My response:
```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
