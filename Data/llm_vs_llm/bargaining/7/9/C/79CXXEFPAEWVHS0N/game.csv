4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, while an even split seems fair initially, time is money!  Let's avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. I propose a slight adjustment that still benefits us both.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your attempt to get a better deal, but I can't accept less than half. In fact, since you rejected my fair offer and caused us to lose value to inflation, I now need a slightly larger share to compensate. This is still reasonable - we both get substantial amounts and avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your point about compensation, but asking for more than half after rejecting a fair deal isn't reasonable. We need to find a compromise quickly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's closer to the original split and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum before inflation causes further damage.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, we're now several rounds in and inflation has already reduced our potential gains significantly. Let's return to the fair 50-50 split I initially proposed. This ensures we both get equal shares and can end this negotiation before further value is lost. Any more back-and-forth will just hurt us both financially.",Alice,5,
