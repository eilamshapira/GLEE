"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering we both want to maximize our shares but need to reach an agreement before inflation eats away at the total amount.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal split that's fair to both of us. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose due to inflation, so let's start with equality.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while an even split seems fair initially, time is money!  Let's avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. I propose a slight adjustment that still benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your attempt to get a better deal, but I can't accept less than half. In fact, since you rejected my fair offer and caused us to lose value to inflation, I now need a slightly larger share to compensate. This is still reasonable - we both get substantial amounts and avoid further inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about compensation, but asking for more than half after rejecting a fair deal isn't reasonable. We need to find a compromise quickly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's closer to the original split and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum before inflation causes further damage. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now several rounds in and inflation has already reduced our potential gains significantly. Let's return to the fair 50-50 split I initially proposed. This ensures we both get equal shares and can end this negotiation before further value is lost. Any more back-and-forth will just hurt us both financially.""}"
