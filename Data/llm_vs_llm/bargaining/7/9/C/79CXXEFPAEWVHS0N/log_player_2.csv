Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split that's fair to both of us. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose due to inflation, so let's start with equality.

""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, while an even split seems fair initially, time is money!  Let's avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. I propose a slight adjustment that still benefits us both.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your attempt to get a better deal, but I can't accept less than half. In fact, since you rejected my fair offer and caused us to lose value to inflation, I now need a slightly larger share to compensate. This is still reasonable - we both get substantial amounts and avoid further inflation losses.

# Alice gain: 5500

""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about compensation, but asking for more than half after rejecting a fair deal isn't reasonable. We need to find a compromise quickly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's closer to the original split and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum before inflation causes further damage.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now several rounds in and inflation has already reduced our potential gains significantly. Let's return to the fair 50-50 split I initially proposed. This ensures we both get equal shares and can end this negotiation before further value is lost. Any more back-and-forth will just hurt us both financially.

# Alice gain: 5000
