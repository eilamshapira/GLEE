This is a tough decision, and there's no guarantee of a ""better"" outcome by continuing to reject. Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Inflation:** While I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob, it's steadily eroding the value of the money for me.  Waiting longer could mean even if I get a slightly better split in later rounds, the actual value I receive is less.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob has consistently offered me deals where he gets the larger share. This suggests he may be more sensitive to inflation than he's letting on, or he places a higher value on getting the deal done. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a much better deal carries the risk of Bob getting impatient and the negotiations breaking down entirely. Accepting now secures me a reasonable sum. 

It's a gamble either way, but in the face of uncertainty, securing a decent amount now seems preferable to potentially getting a worse outcome later."
