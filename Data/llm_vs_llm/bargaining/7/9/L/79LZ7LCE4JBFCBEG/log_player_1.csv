"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while leaving Bob with a reasonable amount.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair proposal where I get $60 and Bob gets $40. If Bob rejects this, his next round's money will be worth 20% less, so this should be an attractive offer for him."
