"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, as we need to account for the different inflation rates affecting us. Since my money loses value faster (10% per round versus Bob's 5%), I'm suggesting a slight advantage for me in this initial offer while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for our different inflation rates. Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth even less for both of us, with my loss being greater due to the higher inflation rate. This 52.5-47.5 split gives Bob a better deal than my first offer while still recognizing that I need some protection against the faster depreciation of my potential earnings."
