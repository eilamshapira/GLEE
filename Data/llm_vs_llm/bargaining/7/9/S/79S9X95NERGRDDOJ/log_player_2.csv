"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I could get is now worth $1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 = $902,500 (since it's the second round for me, with 5% less each round).
The original amount Alice could get is now worth $1,000,000 * (0.9)^2 = $810,000 (since it's the second round for her, with 10% less each round).

However, you provided the correct inflation values for this round:
The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, so $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500.
The money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round, so $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000.

Alice's offer is $475,000 for me and $525,000 for her. 

I'll accept this offer since it seems reasonable given the inflation.
