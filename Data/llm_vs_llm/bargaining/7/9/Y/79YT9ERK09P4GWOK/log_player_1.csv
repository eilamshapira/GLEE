"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering our respective inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I think this is a fair division given our different inflation rates. Since my money loses 5% value each round while Bob's loses 10%, I'm offering a slight advantage to myself but still giving Bob a substantial portion. If we move to another round, the total pot becomes less valuable for both of us, but especially for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider our positions carefully. The total value is decreasing with each round, and Bob's money loses value faster than mine. Let me make a revised offer.

{""alice_gain"": 515000, ""bob_gain"": 485000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal, but still maintaining a slight advantage for myself. With inflation affecting Bob more severely (10% per round versus my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This division gives Bob a better deal than my first offer while still recognizing the asymmetric inflation rates."
