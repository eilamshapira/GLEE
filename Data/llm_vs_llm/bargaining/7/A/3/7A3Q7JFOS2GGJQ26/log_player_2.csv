"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

No way! I won't accept getting nothing while Alice takes everything. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, even though the total value will be reduced by 10% for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because while the money is worth 10% less to me now (so my $60 is effectively worth $54), I'm still offering Alice a substantial portion. This split acknowledges both our positions while compensating for my time-based disadvantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still an extremely unfair offer. Even though the money is worth 19% less to me now, getting only $1 (which would be worth about $0.81 to me due to inflation) while Alice gets $99 is not acceptable. I'll make another proposal in the next round, despite the further 10% inflation penalty I'll face."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm increasing my requested share to 70-30 because with the 27.1% inflation penalty I now face (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9), my $70 is actually only worth about $51 to me. This split still leaves Alice with a meaningful amount while trying to compensate for my significant time-based disadvantage. I hope Alice will recognize this as a reasonable adjustment given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to take everything, offering me nothing. Even with the mounting inflation penalty (34.39%), getting $0 is worse than making another counter-offer. At least by continuing, I maintain the possibility of getting something more than zero, even if it's worth less to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm increasing my requested share to 80-20 because with the 40.95% inflation penalty I now face (0.9^5), my $80 is actually only worth about $47.24 to me. Alice seems to be playing very aggressively, consistently offering me nothing or nearly nothing, hoping I'll eventually accept due to the inflation penalty. This offer still gives Alice a meaningful amount while trying to compensate for my severe time-based disadvantage. If Alice continues to reject reasonable offers, we're both losing value in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still being extremely unfair, offering me just 1 cent while taking $99.99. Even with the steep 46.86% inflation penalty, getting just 1 cent (worth even less to me now) is not acceptable. I'll continue to negotiate, even though my bargaining position is getting weaker with each round. At least by continuing, I maintain the possibility of a more reasonable split, even if it's worth less to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}

I'm now requesting a 90-10 split because with the 52.17% inflation penalty I now face (0.9^7), my $90 is actually only worth about $43 to me. Alice has consistently shown unwillingness to make any reasonable offers, always proposing either $0 or nearly $0 for me. This higher split attempts to compensate for both the severe time-based disadvantage I face and Alice's apparent strategy of trying to wear me down through inflation. Even with this seemingly high split, I'm actually getting less real value than what I proposed in earlier rounds, while still leaving Alice with something. If Alice continues to reject, we're both losing value in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 90.01 
# Alice gain: 9.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. Even though the money is worth 56.95% less to me now, getting $90.01 (which is worth about $38.75 to me after the inflation penalty) is better than continuing this negotiation where my position would keep getting weaker. This is actually a reasonable offer from Alice, finally acknowledging the inflation penalty I face. Taking this deal now is better than continuing to another round where any amount would be worth even less to me."
