"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives us both a decent starting point. Accept and let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 and keeping $60
* If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer
* However, due to 10% inflation, $100 will be worth $90 next round for me
* For Alice, it will be worth $80 due to 20% inflation
* $40 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the inflation penalty makes accepting a decent offer early more attractive. $40 is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
