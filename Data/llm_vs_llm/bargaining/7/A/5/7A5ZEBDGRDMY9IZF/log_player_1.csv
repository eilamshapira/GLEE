Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the future: if you reject this offer, delay will only hurt you since every round reduces your money's value by 10%. In round 3—as proposer—you won’t be able to reap any real gains because I know my continuation value remains intact. Accept this offer now, and you secure what you can, instead of risking an even lower outcome later.

Accept this offer now so you secure even a minimal amount before further devaluation makes your position untenable.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the discount you'll face if you wait. Right now, your dollar is worth about 59¢ compared to its original value, and by round 7 it will drop further to roughly 53¢. If you reject now, you’ll have to make an offer in round 7 where my next move guarantees me nearly everything. Accept this offer to secure even a token amount rather than risk walking away with nothing.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 9 you’d be the proposer, but the discount on your share will deepen to about 57% (your dollars would be worth only 43% of face value). Here, my offer gives you 900000 nominal, which at today's round 8 discount (≈47.83% effective value) is worth around 430467—essentially matching what you'd get next round but without further delay. Accept this offer now to secure your best possible outcome.
