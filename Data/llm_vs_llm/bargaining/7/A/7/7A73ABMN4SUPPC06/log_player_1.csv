"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, given that inflation will hurt my gains if we continue to later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest this split as it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk a counter-offer in the next round. My reasoning is that if Bob rejects and we go to the next round, my potential gains would be affected by 5% inflation, so I'm incentivized to make a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * Even if I proposed and got a better split, it would be worth even less
   * No guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer
   * The decreasing value due to inflation puts me at a disadvantage in further negotiations

Given these factors, while I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the inflation effect makes it reasonable to accept now rather than risk further value decrease.
