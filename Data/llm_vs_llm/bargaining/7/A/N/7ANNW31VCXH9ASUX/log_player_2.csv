"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   * I can make an offer
   * The money will be worth 20% less to Alice (but same for me)
   * This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal
3. Since Alice's utility decreases by 20% each round, but mine doesn't, I have a stronger negotiating position
4. A 50-50 split doesn't take into account this asymmetry in our positions

Therefore, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I know that:
1. Money loses 20% value each round for Alice, but not for me
2. We have 10 rounds remaining
3. Alice should be motivated to accept sooner rather than later

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This means I get $6,000 and Alice gets $4,000. This reflects the fact that I have more patience in this negotiation due to not being affected by the devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting offer. Let me analyze:

1. Alice is offering me 70% ($7000) and taking 30% ($3000)
2. This is actually better for me than my previous offer
3. For Alice, her $3000 is worth only 64% of its original value (due to 36% inflation), so it's effectively worth $1,920 to her
4. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * Alice's money will be worth even less (56% less than original)
   * But I might not get a better deal than $7000

Given that:
- This is a very good offer for me ($7000)
- Alice is already accepting a significant reduction in her share
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal by continuing
- The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I will accept this offer.
