"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
- Initial amount: $10,000
- Offered to me: $4,000
- If I reject, next round's $10,000 is worth 20% less to me ($8,000 effective value)
- The next round I could propose a better split, but Alice could reject
- We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

While 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further rounds where the money is worth less to me. If Alice rejects my next proposal, we'd need multiple rounds to reach agreement, each with 20% inflation penalty for me.
