Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I take $70, and you get $30. If we delay, my share loses 20% of its value with each round, so it's beneficial for both of us to settle now. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I believe a more equitable split is in order. How about 60/40?  We can avoid further inflation losses this way. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
