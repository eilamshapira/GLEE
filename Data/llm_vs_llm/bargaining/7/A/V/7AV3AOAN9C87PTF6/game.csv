99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $99 and you get $1. Given that further rounds reduce your dollar‐value by 5% each time while mine remain full value, accepting now is optimal for you. I believe this is a smart and fair move – let’s agree and wrap this up!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it was too one-sided. Let's split it evenly at $50 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, despite the inflation affecting me. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your fair‐looking split, but given the strategic advantage I gain by becoming the proposer in the next round – and considering that my money’s value doesn’t depreciate – I believe rejecting and waiting will lead to a better outcome for me. Let's continue the game.",Alice,2,reject
98.0,2.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 your dollars are now worth 10% less than their face value—waiting even one more round drops that value further. With that in mind, I propose that I take $98 and you get $2. This way you secure $1.80 in real value right now rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I believe this is the smartest move given the inflation costs on your side. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting me more, but your last offer was still too skewed. How about I take $40 and you take $60? This way, you get more than half, and I still get a reasonable amount considering the inflation. Let's find a middle ground and end this.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find common ground. However, by rejecting your current offer, I secure the chance to propose in the next round—where the inflation further diminishes the real value of your share. I believe this will allow me to secure an even better outcome for myself. Let's continue the game and see if we can both eventually agree on a fair split.",Alice,4,reject
97.0,3.0,"Hi Bob, considering that each additional round further erodes the real value of your share while my amount remains constant, I’m proposing a division where I take $97 and you receive $3. Although it might seem small, this is a strategic offer ensuring that you get as much real value as possible right now—far better than what you’d face after another round’s inflation hit. I hope you see the benefit in finalizing our deal today. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
70.0,30.0,"Hi Alice, I see that inflation is hitting me hard, but your offers are still too one-sided. Let's try $30 for me and $70 for you. This gives you a significant majority while still providing me with a fair share, considering the diminishing value of money for me. Can we agree on this and end the game?",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but waiting one more round only increases my advantage since your share’s value continues to drop further with inflation. I believe that in the next round I can propose an even more favorable division for myself, leaving you with a lower effective share. Therefore, I must reject your proposal and proceed to round 7.",Alice,6,reject
96.0,4.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 7. With each round your share loses more of its purchasing power—at this point it’s estimated to be worth roughly 30% less than face value. That means if you accept 4 dollars now, you’re effectively getting about $2.80 in today’s dollars. Waiting for the next round would only worsen that discount further. I’m offering you this share to hedge against the depreciation risk. Let’s settle now before the value drops even more.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
80.0,20.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation impact is significant for me, but your offers are still too skewed. How about $20 for me and $80 for you? This way, you get a large majority, and I still receive something worthwhile despite the ongoing depreciation. Let's end this game on a fair note.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to propose a split, but your offer still doesn't maximize my advantage. Given that in the next round I'll have the opportunity to propose—and knowing that your money will continue to lose value—I can secure an even better share for myself. I must therefore decline your offer and move on to the next round.",Alice,8,reject
95.0,5.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into Round 9, the depreciation on your share continues to stack up. Accepting $5 now will give you more real value than waiting another round, where your portion loses even more purchasing power while my amount remains intact. I’m offering a split of $95 for me and $5 for you, which is the best compromise I can make given the circumstances. Let's settle now before conditions worsen further.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
90.0,10.0,"Hi Alice, we're now in Round 10, and the inflation is really taking a toll on my share. I'm proposing $10 for me and $90 for you. This way, you get the vast majority, and I still get something that's worth considering, even with the depreciation. Let's end this game and move on.",Bob,10,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but considering that your money loses even more value in the next round, I can secure an even more favorable position for myself. I’m looking forward to proposing a division in round 11 that better reflects the continuing depreciation you're facing. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,10,reject
94.0,6.0,"Hi Bob, we're now in Round 11 and the inflation on your share is worsening even more—your dollars are now worth significantly less compared to face value. In contrast, my share hasn't been affected. Therefore, I propose a division where I take $94 and you receive $6. Accepting this offer now means you lock in a higher effective value than waiting further, as any delay will only compound the depreciation on your end. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses for you.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
95.0,5.0,"Hi Alice, we're now in Round 12, and the inflation has severely impacted my share. I'm willing to accept $5 for myself and give you $95. This is a significant concession on my part, considering the depreciation, but I believe it's time to end this game. What do you say?",Bob,12,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your concession. Given the heavy depreciation you're facing, this split is a practical conclusion. Accepting $95 for me and $5 for you now ensures a fair termination of the game. Let's settle it and move on.",Alice,12,accept
