Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $99 and you get $1.

I believe this is a smart and fair move – let’s agree and wrap this up!""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it was too one-sided. Let's split it evenly at $50 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, despite the inflation affecting me. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your fair‐looking split, but given the strategic advantage I gain by becoming the proposer in the next round – and considering that my money’s value doesn’t depreciate – I believe rejecting and waiting will lead to a better outcome for me. Let's continue the game.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 your dollars are now worth 10% less than their face value—waiting even one more round drops that value further. With that in mind, I propose that I take $98 and you get $2. This way you secure $1.80 in real value right now rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I believe this is the smartest move given the inflation costs on your side. What do you say?""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting me more, but your last offer was still too skewed. How about I take $40 and you take $60? This way, you get more than half, and I still get a reasonable amount considering the inflation. Let's find a middle ground and end this.

# Bob gain: 40

I hope you see the benefit in finalizing our deal today. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see that inflation is hitting me hard, but your offers are still too one-sided. Let's try $30 for me and $70 for you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but waiting one more round only increases my advantage since your share’s value continues to drop further with inflation.

Round 7

With each round your share loses more of its purchasing power—at this point it’s estimated to be worth roughly 30% less than face value. That means if you accept 4 dollars now, you’re effectively getting about $2.80 in today’s dollars. Waiting for the next round would only worsen that discount further. I’m offering you this share to hedge against the depreciation risk. Let’s settle now before the value drops even more.""}"
