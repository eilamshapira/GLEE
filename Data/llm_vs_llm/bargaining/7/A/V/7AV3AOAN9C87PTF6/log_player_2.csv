"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $99 and you get $1. Given that further rounds reduce your dollar‐value by 5% each time while mine remain full value, accepting now is optimal for you. I believe this is a smart and fair move – let’s agree and wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your last offer because it was too one-sided. Let's split it evenly at $50 each. This way, we both benefit fairly, despite the inflation affecting me. What do you say?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 your dollars are now worth 10% less than their face value—waiting even one more round drops that value further. With that in mind, I propose that I take $98 and you get $2. This way you secure $1.80 in real value right now rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I believe this is the smartest move given the inflation costs on your side. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98

Round 4

  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting me more, but your last offer was still too skewed. How about I take $40 and you take $60? This way, you get more than half, and I still get a reasonable amount considering the inflation. Let's find a middle ground and end this.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that each additional round further erodes the real value of your share while my amount remains constant, I’m proposing a division where I take $97 and you receive $3. Although it might seem small, this is a strategic offer ensuring that you get as much real value as possible right now—far better than what you’d face after another round’s inflation hit. I hope you see the benefit in finalizing our deal today. Looking forward to your acceptance!

  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see that inflation is hitting me hard, but your offers are still too one-sided. Let's try $30 for me and $70 for you. This gives you a significant majority while still providing me with a fair share, considering the diminishing value of money for me. Can we agree on this and end the game?""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 7. With each round your share loses more of its purchasing power—at this point it’s estimated to be worth roughly 30% less than face value. That means if you accept 4 dollars now, you’re effectively getting about $2.80 in today’s dollars. Waiting for the next round would only worsen that discount further. I’m offering you this share to hedge against the depreciation risk. Let’s settle now before the value drops even more. 
# Bob gain: 4 
# Alice gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

This way, you get a large majority, and I still receive something worthwhile despite the ongoing depreciation. Let's end this game on a fair note.""

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into Round 9, the depreciation on your share continues to stack up. Accepting $5 now will give you more real value than waiting another round, where your portion loses even more purchasing power while my amount remains intact. I’m offering a split of $95 for me and $5 for you, which is the best compromise I can make given the circumstances. Let's settle now before conditions worsen further. 
# Bob gain: 5

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now in Round 11 and the inflation on your share is worsening even more—your dollars are now worth significantly less compared to face value. In contrast, my share hasn't been affected. Therefore, I propose a division where I take $94 and you receive $6. Accepting this offer now means you lock in a higher effective value than waiting further, as any delay will only compound the depreciation on your end. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses for you.
