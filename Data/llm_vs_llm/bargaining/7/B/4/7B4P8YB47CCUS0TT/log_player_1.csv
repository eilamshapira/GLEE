"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I will make a proposal to divide the $100, keeping in mind the potential for future rounds and the impact of inflation. My first offer is:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that this gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a significant portion, increasing the likelihood of acceptance in this early round when the full value of the money is still available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer. Now, in round 2, the total value has effectively decreased due to the 10% inflation. Bob is offering me $45.

Let's calculate the present value of my potential gains if I reject and proceed to future rounds, considering the inflation:

Round 3: Max gain would be worth 81% of the original.
Round 4: Max gain would be worth 72.9% of the original.

Given that Bob is offering $45 now, and that is already worth 90% of the original amount, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
