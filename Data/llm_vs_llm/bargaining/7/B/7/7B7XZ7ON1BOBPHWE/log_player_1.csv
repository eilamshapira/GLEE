"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round). This is fair and we can both walk away with a good amount right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate, I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer, and it's in your best interest to accept it before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): The value proposition is getting worse, but there's still room to negotiate. With Bob's money devaluing faster (20% vs 10% per round), I have more leverage. I'll make another offer in the next round that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be practical here. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, waiting hurts you more than me. I'm offering you 4500 now, which is worth more than a larger sum later. This is a fair compromise - let's end this efficiently.""}"
