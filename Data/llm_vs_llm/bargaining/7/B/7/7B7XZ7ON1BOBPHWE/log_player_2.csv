"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round). This is fair and we can both walk away with a good amount right now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money loses value with each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the 20% loss.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate, I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer, and it's in your best interest to accept it before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical here. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, waiting hurts you more than me. I'm offering you 4500 now, which is worth more than a larger sum later. This is a fair compromise - let's end this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that the money I gain is already worth 36% less than in the first round, I should try to get the best deal possible.

However, since Alice's offer gives me $4500, which is still a significant amount, and waiting will only decrease the value further, I should weigh my options carefully.
