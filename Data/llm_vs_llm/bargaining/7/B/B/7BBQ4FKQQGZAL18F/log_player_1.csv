"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this bargaining game.

Given that inflation affects both of us differently (5% for me, 10% for Bob), I should consider a fair division that accounts for these different discount rates.

{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000}

Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $540,000 and you get $460,000. This is a reasonable division that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for our different inflation penalties. Since your discount rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), you have more incentive to agree early, but I've factored that in by offering you a generous share."
