600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we settle right away. I’d like to receive $600000 and you get $400000. Since each round costs me 10% of the value, it makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than delay. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest to conclude the game quickly.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your concern about the cost of each round, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair. Let's settle on this and avoid further depreciation. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your clear proposal. Given the depreciation I'll face in subsequent rounds, accepting 45% of the current pot is more attractive than risking further rounds. I’m happy to settle on your suggested terms.",Alice,2,accept
