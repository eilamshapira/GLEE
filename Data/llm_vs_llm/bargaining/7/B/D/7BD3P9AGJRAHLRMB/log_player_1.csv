"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we settle right away. I’d like to receive $600,000 and you get $400,000. Since each round costs me 10% of the value, it makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than delay. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest to conclude the game quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your concern about the cost of each round, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair. Let's settle on this and avoid further depreciation. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your clear proposal. Given the depreciation I'll face in subsequent rounds, accepting 45% of the current pot is more attractive than risking further rounds. I’m happy to settle on your suggested terms.""}"
