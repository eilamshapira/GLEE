"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we settle right away. Iâ€™d like to receive $600000 and you get $400000. Since each round costs me 10% of the value, it makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than delay. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest to conclude the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $400,000 and I don't know the inflation effect on her, but I do know that with each passing round, the money is worth 0% less for me, I should consider the potential risks and benefits of accepting or rejecting this offer.

Given that I have 12 rounds to divide the money and the money doesn't depreciate for me, I should try to negotiate for a better deal. Accepting this offer might be too hasty, as I could potentially get a better offer in a later round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since Alice proposed a 60-40 split in her favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand your concern about the cost of each round, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair. Let's settle on this and avoid further depreciation. Looking forward to your response.""}"
