550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This is a generous offer considering I could have asked for much more.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"Alice, I propose this division. If you reject, you'll have to make the next move, and given the structure of the game, your expected outcome will be minimal. Accept this offer to secure your $10000 rather than risking a less favorable result in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. A 50-50 split is the fairest solution and we'll both walk away happy. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we risk getting nothing. This is a perfectly equal division - there's no reason to reject it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, considering the remaining rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing, I'm offering a division that gives you $400000 outright. This is a slight adjustment from equal split to account for the inevitable negotiation dynamics. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a substantial amount now without risking future reductions.",Bob,4,
