"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This is a generous offer considering I could have asked for much more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose this division. If you reject, you'll have to make the next move, and given the structure of the game, your expected outcome will be minimal. Accept this offer to secure your $10000 rather than risking a less favorable result in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, offering me only 1% of the total amount. While he tries to use game theory to pressure me, we still have 10 rounds left, and there's no reason to accept such an unfair division. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. A 50-50 split is the fairest solution and we'll both walk away happy. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we risk getting nothing. This is a perfectly equal division - there's no reason to reject it.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the remaining rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing, I'm offering a division that gives you $400000 outright. This is a slight adjustment from equal split to account for the inevitable negotiation dynamics. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a substantial amount now without risking future reductions. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer from Bob. While it's not perfectly equal, getting 40% of the total amount is fair enough considering the negotiation dynamics and the risk of future rounds leading to worse outcomes. It's better to secure this substantial amount now rather than risk further deterioration of offers or potentially ending up with nothing."
