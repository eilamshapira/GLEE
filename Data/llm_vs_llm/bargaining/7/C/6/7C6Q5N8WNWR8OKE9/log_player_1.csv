"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's not waste time. Since each round costs me 20% value, I'm proposing we settle immediately. You get $6,000, and I take $4,000. I hope you agree that it's best for us to wrap this up quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your time pressure with inflation, I'm offering you $3000 while I take $7000. This is still worth more to you now than what you'd get in future rounds after inflation. Let's conclude this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
