"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. Since each round costs me 20% value, I'm proposing we settle immediately. You get $6000, and I take $4000. I hope you agree that it's best for us to wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice mentioned that each round costs her 20% value, but for me, there's no inflation penalty (0% loss per round)
2. She's offering me $6000 out of $10000, which is a 60-40 split in my favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round without any loss on my side
4. Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, she's more pressured to reach a deal quickly
5. Given these conditions, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I know Alice faces 20% inflation per round and I don't, I can leverage this to get a better deal. However, I shouldn't be too greedy as she might still reject and the negotiation could drag on.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering your time pressure with inflation, I'm offering you $3000 while I take $7000. This is still worth more to you now than what you'd get in future rounds after inflation. Let's conclude this deal now.""}"
