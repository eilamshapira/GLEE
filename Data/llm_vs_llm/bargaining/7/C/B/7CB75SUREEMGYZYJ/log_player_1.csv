"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly better split for me to account for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the $40 offered is equivalent to $40 * 0.9 = $36 in the previous round.

I don't think this is a fair split, especially since the money will continue to lose value in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own losses.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100%.
In Round 2, the money was worth 90% for me and 95% for Bob.
In Round 3, the money is worth 81% for me (0.9 * 0.9) and 90.25% for Bob (0.95 * 0.95).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much of our money!""}"
