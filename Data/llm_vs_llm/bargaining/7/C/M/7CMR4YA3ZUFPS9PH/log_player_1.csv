"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first offer. This is a fair proposal that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my initiative.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a 55-45 split this time. It's a fairer distribution considering the impact of inflation on my end. I hope you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4500, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation
   * Actual value for me = $4500 * 0.8 = $3600

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
   * Even if I could get $6000 in the next round, it would be worth only $6000 * 0.6 = $3600

Since there's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer in the next round, and the money will continue to lose value for me at a faster rate than for Bob, I should accept this offer.
