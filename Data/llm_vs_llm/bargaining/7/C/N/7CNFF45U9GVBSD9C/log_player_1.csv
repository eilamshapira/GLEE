"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation rates and the limited number of rounds:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself. This gives me a better outcome if Bob accepts early.
*   I'm also giving Bob a significant enough amount ($40) that he might be tempted to accept now rather than risk further losses from inflation in subsequent rounds.
*   Since it is round 1, I consider that both players can get quite a lot of money, so I will not be too greedy."
