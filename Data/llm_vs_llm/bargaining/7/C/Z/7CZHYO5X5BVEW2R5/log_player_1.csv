"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This is a fair split considering the decreasing value for me. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
