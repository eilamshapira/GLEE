"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation risk while remaining fair enough to be attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this split because if Bob rejects it, any money we receive next round will be worth 20% less to me, so I need to secure a good portion now. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk a counter-offer. A 60-40 split feels reasonable as it gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
- I get $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3200 to me
- Bob gets $6000, with 5% inflation it's worth $5700 to him

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make a new offer
- But the money will be worth even less (40% less than original value for me)
- Any amount I get in the next round would be significantly devalued

Given that:
- Further delays will severely impact my gains due to the high inflation rate affecting me
- The difference between current value ($3200) and potential future gains (which would be heavily deflated) makes accepting now more attractive
- The risk of ending up with an even worse deal is significant
