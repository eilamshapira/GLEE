600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is fair since we both walk away with significant value, and delaying will only reduce what I can get while your amount stays the same in value.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, time is more valuable to you. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair because if you reject and we go another round, your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle here. With a 55-45 split, we both get substantial value. Remember, if we keep going back and forth, we both risk getting nothing by round 12. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the inflation I face while still giving you a significant portion.",Alice,3,
