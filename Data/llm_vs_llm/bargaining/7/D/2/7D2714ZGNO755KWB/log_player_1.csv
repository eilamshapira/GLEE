"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is fair since we both walk away with significant value, and delaying will only reduce what I can get while your amount stays the same in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, time is more valuable to you. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair because if you reject and we go another round, your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle here. With a 55-45 split, we both get substantial value. Remember, if we keep going back and forth, we both risk getting nothing by round 12. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the inflation I face while still giving you a significant portion.""}"
