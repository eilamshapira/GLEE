"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is fair since we both walk away with significant value, and delaying will only reduce what I can get while your amount stays the same in value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's reasoning about inflation is correct - she loses 10% value each round while I don't
2. However, this also means I have more leverage in negotiations since time pressure affects her more than me
3. A 60-40 split in her favor seems too high given this dynamic
4. By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me, and she'll be under pressure to accept due to inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that reflects my stronger negotiating position while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, time is more valuable to you. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair because if you reject and we go another round, your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle here. With a 55-45 split, we both get substantial value. Remember, if we keep going back and forth, we both risk getting nothing by round 12. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the inflation I face while still giving you a significant portion. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has moved from 60-40 to 55-45, showing willingness to compromise
2. Her share is already worth 19% less than round 1
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, and her share will be worth even less
4. While I could push for more, there's a risk of prolonging too long
5. 450K for me is still a substantial amount, and I don't lose value over time
6. The threat of getting nothing by round 12 is real

While I might get a bit more by continuing, the risk-reward ratio isn't favorable enough. This is a reasonable compromise.
