"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. The $4750 offered to me is actually worth $4750 * 0.9 = $4275 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each round, and we're now in the 3rd round, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

To make an offer that benefits me, I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, the $6000 I gain is worth $6000 * 0.81 = $4860 to me, which is still a significant amount."
