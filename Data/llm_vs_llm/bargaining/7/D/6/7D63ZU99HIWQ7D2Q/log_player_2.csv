"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. We each take a bit more than half. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $45, while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't a perfectly equal split, it's reasonably close. If I reject:

1. The money will be worth 10% less next round (so $100 becomes $90)
2. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. We only have 12 rounds total, and risk getting nothing if we can't agree

Since $45 is a decent offer and the value will only decrease with time, I'll accept this offer.
