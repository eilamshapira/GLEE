"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (roughly “solving” the alternating‐offers game with 12 rounds and with money “depreciating” 10% per round for you and 20% for Bob), a sub‐game perfect proposal by Alice in round 1 is to offer Bob just enough (in nominal dollars) that his “continuation value” if he waits equals what he’d get later. One way to arrive at an approximate equilibrium is as follows (all money figures are in nominal dollars):

• In the final round (round 12, with Bob proposing), Bob would give Alice nearly nothing and keep almost the whole $1,000,000. But because by round 12 Bob’s money is worth only 80%⁽¹¹⁾—that is, about 1,000,000×0.8¹¹ ≈ 85,900 in “today‐value”—Alice’s “outside option” is essentially zero.

• Working backward (round 11 with you proposing, round 10 with Bob, round 9 with you, etc.) one finds that the “threat point” for Bob at round 2 (when he would next be the proposer) is that he could secure (after his discount factor of 20% for one extra round) roughly 387,555 “today‐dollars” in value.

Thus, in round 1 (where discounting is not yet in effect for either party) you must offer Bob a nominal amount F that “yields” him at least 387,555 in value. In other words, the smallest F for Bob is about 387,555, leaving you about 612,445.

Accordingly, my round‑1 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 612445, ""bob_gain"": 387555} 

This proposal is “just generous enough” for Bob to be indifferent between accepting now or waiting until round 2 (when his money would be worth 20% less per round), so in equilibrium he should accept."
