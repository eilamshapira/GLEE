The offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  We're past the halfway point, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

I'm increasing my demand to signal that I'm serious about getting a larger share.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."

This is getting close to crunch time. While Alice's offer is improving, accepting now means losing a significant chunk of the initial amount due to inflation. I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next couple of rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going back to my offer from Round 2.  With the increasing inflation, this offer is more appealing to Alice now than it was then.  This might be my last chance to secure a decent amount."

Finally, a reasonable offer! While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is far better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds.  The effects of inflation are too significant to gamble further."
