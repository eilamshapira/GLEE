"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair division that takes into account the inflation effect I'm experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because I'm facing 5% inflation each round, which means waiting will cost me. This gives us both a substantial amount while acknowledging the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we need to find a middle ground given the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges both my inflation pressure and Bob's desire for a larger share. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now than in round 1, I need to secure enough to offset this effect while still making an attractive offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're moving toward smaller offers for me with each round, while I'm also facing increasing inflation. Let me propose a compromise that accounts for this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair and balanced, and considering we're now in round 5 where the money is worth about 19% less to me than in round 1, accepting an equal division would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate while my purchasing power decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we're still not reaching an agreement, and the inflation impact on my side continues to grow. Let me try a more accommodating approach.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm now offering Bob the same split he proposed in round 2. With the inflation effect now at over 26% for me compared to round 1, it's becoming increasingly important that we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob a majority share while still providing me with enough to offset some of my inflation losses."
