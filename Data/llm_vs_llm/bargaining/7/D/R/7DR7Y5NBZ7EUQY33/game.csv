50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for starting with a reasonable offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'm also interested in reaching a fair agreement quickly. I propose a simple 50/50 split which is completely equal and fair to both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation early and both walk away satisfied.",Bob,2,
