Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,

  ""message"": ""Bob, let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives us both a good starting point, and avoids wasting time on smaller offers in the early rounds when inflation is lower.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for starting with a reasonable offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'm also interested in reaching a fair agreement quickly. I propose a simple 50/50 split which is completely equal and fair to both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation early and both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
