"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives us both a good starting point, and avoids wasting time on smaller offers in the early rounds when inflation is lower. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 55/45 split, giving me $45 and her $55.

Looking at the situation:
1) This is just the first round, so I have plenty of opportunities to make a counter-offer
2) Since inflation is 0% for me, the money's value doesn't decrease over time
3) We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds or we both get nothing
4) I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me leverage in later rounds

While $45 is a substantial amount, I believe I can reasonably counter with a more favorable split since there's no time pressure for me due to 0% inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges Alice's initial approach while trying to improve my position a bit.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting with a reasonable offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'm also interested in reaching a fair agreement quickly. I propose a simple 50/50 split which is completely equal and fair to both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation early and both walk away satisfied.""}"
