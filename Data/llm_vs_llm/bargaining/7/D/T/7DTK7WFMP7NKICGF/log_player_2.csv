Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. How about a 52/48 split in your favor? It's closer to your offer, but accounts for me losing value in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I understand your concern about inflation, so I'm willing to split it 55-45 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice to a better deal. Accepting 45% after three rounds means I'm losing a lot to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is eating into my share rapidly.  I'm proposing a 54/46 split.  This is a reasonable compromise to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
