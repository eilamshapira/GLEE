"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor given I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it simply reverses my previous proposal but in Bob's favor. We can find a more equitable solution, and we still have plenty of rounds remaining for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split to demonstrate my willingness to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we each get $500,000. This is completely fair and equal, and there's no rational reason to reject it. We both walk away with a significant sum, and neither player has an advantage over the other."
