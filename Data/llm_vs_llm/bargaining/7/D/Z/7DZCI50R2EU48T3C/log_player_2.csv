"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. 

While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount of money. The important factors to consider are:
1. I have many rounds left to negotiate
2. There's no inflation penalty for me
3. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. However, there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Since this is just the first round and I can make a counter-offer without any penalty to myself, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I'm making the proposal now.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

The split I'm proposing gives me 55% and Alice 45% of the total amount. This is more equitable than Alice's first offer while still being advantageous to me. It's a reasonable middle ground that I hope Alice will accept, considering that:
1. It's more balanced than her initial offer
2. She still gets a substantial amount ($450,000)
3. We still have many rounds left, but we shouldn't risk waiting too long
4. We both need to avoid the scenario where we get nothing after 12 rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer is better than her first offer ($450,000 vs $400,000 for me)
2. I now know that Alice is affected by inflation (19% less value for her)
3. The $550,000 Alice wants is actually worth only about $445,500 to her due to inflation
4. My $450,000 maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
5. This makes the deal fairly advantageous for me in real terms
6. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation will keep affecting Alice's value

Given that:
- I get a better amount than the first offer
- The real value for Alice is decreased due to inflation
- My portion maintains full value
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations

This seems like a good deal for me, especially knowing that Alice's position will weaken with inflation.
