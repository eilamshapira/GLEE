"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I am starting. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer gives me $40 and Alice $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting $45-50 next round which would be worth less due to inflation
5. While not perfectly equal, it's a reasonable starting offer
