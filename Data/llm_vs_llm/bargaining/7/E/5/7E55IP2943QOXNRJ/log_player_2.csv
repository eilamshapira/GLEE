"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep things simple and fair by splitting the $10000 equally. How does that sound to you? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a completely fair and equal division
3. I know I won't lose money to inflation in future rounds
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice might propose a less favorable split in the next round
5. A 50-50 split is a standard solution in such negotiations and generally considered fair

Given these considerations, I think accepting this fair offer in the first round is the best strategy. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal later, and I risk getting a worse offer or potentially nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
