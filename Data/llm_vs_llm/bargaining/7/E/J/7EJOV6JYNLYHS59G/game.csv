3073.88,6926.12,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 so that you get $6926.12 and I get $3073.88. This offer reflects our future bargaining positions given the discounting (with my money losing 20% per round and yours 10%). Accepting now guarantees you at least as much as you’d secure on your turn next round, so let’s avoid the further devaluation. Looking forward to a fair agreement!",Alice,1,
