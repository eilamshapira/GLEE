"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3073.88, ""bob_gain"": 6926.12, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 so that you get $6926.12 and I get $3073.88. This offer reflects our future bargaining positions given the discounting (with my money losing 20% per round and yours 10%). Accepting now guarantees you at least as much as you’d secure on your turn next round, so let’s avoid the further devaluation. Looking forward to a fair agreement!""}"
