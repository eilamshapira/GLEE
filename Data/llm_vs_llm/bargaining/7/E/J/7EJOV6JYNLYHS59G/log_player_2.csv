"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 so that you get $6926.12 and I get $3073.88. This offer reflects our future bargaining positions given the discounting (with my money losing 20% per round and yours 10%). Accepting now guarantees you at least as much as you’d secure on your turn next round, so let’s avoid the further devaluation. Looking forward to a fair agreement! 
# Bob gain: 6926.12 
# Alice gain: 3073.88 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
