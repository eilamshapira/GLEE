"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from prolonging negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My counter-offer reflects the decreased value of the money for me due to inflation. I'm offering 32% of the original amount. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $680,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation
   * Actual value for me = $680,000 Ã— 0.9 = $612,000

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 20% less for me
   * I'll have another chance to make an offer, but the total value will be significantly decreased
   * Both of us will lose more value due to inflation

Since Bob's offer gives me more value ($612,000) than my initial proposal ($600,000), and waiting would only decrease the money's value further, I should accept.
