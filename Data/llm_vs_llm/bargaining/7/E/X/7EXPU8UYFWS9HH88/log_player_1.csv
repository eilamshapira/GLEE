"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first offer. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my initiative in making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for more than half while my money is devaluing faster. With the current inflation rates, my $45 would be worth even less to me than to Bob. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing (20% vs Bob's 10%). Since my money devalues faster, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value. This split helps compensate for the differential inflation rates while still giving Bob a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is becoming significant (I'm losing almost 50% of value), and continuing to negotiate would erode the value further. Bob's offer of 48% is reasonable enough given the circumstances, and securing a deal now is better than risking further devaluation through more rounds of negotiation."
