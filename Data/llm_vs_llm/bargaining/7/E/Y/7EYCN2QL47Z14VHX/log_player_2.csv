"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, which is less than half
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation, $4500 in this round is worth more than $4500 in the next round
4. If I reject, my $4500 would be worth $4050 in the next round
5. Given the inflation pressure and the fact that this isn't a terrible offer, it might be better to accept
