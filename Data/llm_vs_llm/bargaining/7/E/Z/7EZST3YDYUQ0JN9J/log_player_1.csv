"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure, but my offer accounts for a more equitable split given the inflation we face. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer. While I initially proposed 60-40, accepting 55-45 now is better than continuing to later rounds where Bob's portion would be worth even less to him, potentially making him less likely to accept future offers. The difference between my initial proposal and his counter-offer is small enough to make acceptance the rational choice."
