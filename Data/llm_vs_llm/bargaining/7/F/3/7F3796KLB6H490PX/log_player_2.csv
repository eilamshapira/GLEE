"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and wait until the next round to make a counter-offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round.

While $40 now is less than half, it's better than potentially getting less later if negotiations drag on with inflation reducing the value for me each round.
