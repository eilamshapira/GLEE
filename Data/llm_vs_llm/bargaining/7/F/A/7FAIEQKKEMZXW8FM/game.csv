600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for you (10% per round). If we both reject offers, we'll both lose significantly. This is a fair split accounting for our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. While you do face higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), I'm still facing significant loss per round too. A 50-50 split now gives you $500000 immediately rather than risking further depreciation. If we continue negotiating for several more rounds, we both lose substantially. This equal division respects both our positions and allows us to finish with a significant amount each.",Bob,2,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I've come down from my initial offer to meet you partway. While a 50-50 split might seem fair on the surface, our different inflation rates create an asymmetry. For every round that passes, I lose 20% value while you lose 10%. This means delays hurt me significantly more than you. A 57.5-42.5 split accounts for this difference while still being reasonable. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
