"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for you (10% per round). If we both reject offers, we'll both lose significantly. This is a fair split accounting for our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 (40%) while she gets $600,000 (60%).

She's correct that money loses value faster for her (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). This means waiting is more costly for her than for me.

Given that I have a slight advantage in terms of inflation rate, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, though my money will be worth 10% less and hers 20% less.

I think I can get a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further rounds of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. While you do face higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), I'm still facing significant loss per round too. A 50-50 split now gives you $500,000 immediately rather than risking further depreciation. If we continue negotiating for several more rounds, we both lose substantially. This equal division respects both our positions and allows us to finish with a significant amount each.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've come down from my initial offer to meet you partway. While a 50-50 split might seem fair on the surface, our different inflation rates create an asymmetry. For every round that passes, I lose 20% value while you lose 10%. This means delays hurt me significantly more than you. A 57.5-42.5 split accounts for this difference while still being reasonable. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $425,000 (42.5%) while she gets $575,000 (57.5%).

She's right that our different inflation rates create an asymmetry, with her losing 20% per round compared to my 10%. We've already lost some value after 3 rounds - my potential gains are worth 19% less than round 1, and hers are worth 36% less.

If I reject and we continue to the next round, the money will depreciate further for both of us, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a better agreement. Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split toward my proposed 50-50, showing willingness to compromise.

While I could push for slightly better terms, the risk of continued depreciation outweighs the potential marginal gain. Her offer is reasonable given our different inflation rates.
