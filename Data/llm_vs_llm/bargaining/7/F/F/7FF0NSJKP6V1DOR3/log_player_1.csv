"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the asymmetric inflation rates that affect us differently.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me since inflation affects you more heavily than me (20% vs 5%). This means we both benefit from concluding early, but you especially. This split is fair considering these dynamics.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact, I agree we should conclude early, but I think the split should be closer to equal. This offer balances our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
