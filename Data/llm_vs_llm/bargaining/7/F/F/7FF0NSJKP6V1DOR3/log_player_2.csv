"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me since inflation affects you more heavily than me (20% vs 5%). This means we both benefit from concluding early, but you especially. This split is fair considering these dynamics. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
