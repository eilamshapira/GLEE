"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty for each round I wait.

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split ($500,000 for each of us). If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will effectively be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. 

If I reject and propose a better split next round (say 600,000 for me), Alice might reject it, and we'd go to round 3 where I'd face even more inflation.

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the fact that a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
