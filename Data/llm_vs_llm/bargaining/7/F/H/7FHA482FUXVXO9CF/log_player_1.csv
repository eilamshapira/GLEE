Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My previous offer was rejected, and Bob's offer, while giving me a larger sum, is still not appealing considering the inflation. Also, Bob's inflation seems to be smaller than mine. I will try to offer a more balanced division this time, but still prioritize my gain, as further rounds will be even more disadvantageous for me.
