Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. The money is shrinking fast. I'm willing to compromise and propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's wrap this up before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, taking a 40/60 split after already rejecting a 55/45 split in round 2 would set a bad precedent.  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a fair deal. The longer she waits, the worse it will get for her."
