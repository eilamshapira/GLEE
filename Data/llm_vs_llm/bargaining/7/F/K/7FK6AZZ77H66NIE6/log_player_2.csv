"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
3. If I reject, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject it
4. $500,000 now is better than potentially getting a bit more later with the 10% inflation penalty
5. This is a fair offer that avoids the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12
