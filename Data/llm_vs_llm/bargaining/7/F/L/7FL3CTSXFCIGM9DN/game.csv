555556.0,444444.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $555556 and you receive $444444. This division reflects a fair, discounted split for both of us at the current round – a delay would only reduce our shares by 20% per round. I believe this is a solid starting point for both parties, so I hope you find it acceptable.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the 20% depreciation per round, I propose a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This offer takes into account the reduced value of money and aims for a fair distribution at this stage. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
