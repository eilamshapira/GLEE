"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 555556, ""bob_gain"": 444444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $555,556 and you receive $444,444. This division reflects a fair, discounted split for both of us at the current round – a delay would only reduce our shares by 20% per round. I believe this is a solid starting point for both parties, so I hope you find it acceptable.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% depreciation per round, I propose a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This offer takes into account the reduced value of money and aims for a fair distribution at this stage. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
