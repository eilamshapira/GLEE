"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $555556 and you receive $444444. This division reflects a fair, discounted split for both of us at the current round – a delay would only reduce our shares by 20% per round. I believe this is a solid starting point for both parties, so I hope you find it acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the 20% depreciation per round, I propose a split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This offer takes into account the reduced value of money and aims for a fair distribution at this stage. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.""
