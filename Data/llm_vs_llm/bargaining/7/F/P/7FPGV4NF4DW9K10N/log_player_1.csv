"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's both benefit. Here's a 55/45 split in favor of me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $450,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me, especially since I was initially offering a 60/40 split in my favor.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each passing round, and we're now in Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and 20% less than in Round 1. So, the value of the money to me is now 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob to try to reach an agreement:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, time to cooperate!""
}
```

I'm offering an even split, hoping that Bob will see the value in cooperating and accepting this offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
