"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This is a 40-60 split in her favor.

If I reject and move to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% for me. That means in the next round, the total would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. If I were to propose a 50-50 split in the next round (which Alice might accept), I could get $5,000 but that would be worth $4,750 after inflation.

While Alice's current offer isn't an even split, $4,000 guaranteed now is better than risking rejection in the next round when inflation has already reduced the value. The split is not extremely unfair, and given the inflation penalty, accepting seems reasonable.
