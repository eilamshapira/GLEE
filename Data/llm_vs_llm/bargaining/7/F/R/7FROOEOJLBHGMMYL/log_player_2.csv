"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer, or if I should reject and propose a different division in the next round.

Alice is offering me $4000 out of the $10,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but I'll face 10% inflation, so the total value will be worth only $9,000 to me. 

Let me think about whether I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% per round) than Alice's (5% per round), I need to propose something fair but also recognize the time pressure is stronger for me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I believe is fair to both of us. This gives each of us $5,000. Considering the inflation rates, it would be in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $4000 to $4200, which shows some movement in my direction, but it's still not a 50-50 split.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where:
- My inflation will be 29% (10% more than now)
- Alice's inflation will be 14.75% (5% more than now)

This means the $10,000 would be worth about $7,100 to me and $8,525 to Alice in the next round.

$4200 now is better than getting nothing, but I need to consider if I can get a better offer by rejecting.

Since my inflation rate is higher, time pressure affects me more. $4200 now with 19% inflation means I effectively get about $3,402 in round 1 value.

I'll accept this offer because the increasing inflation makes prolonging negotiations more costly for me than for Alice.
