800000.0,200000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I hope we can agree and finish this quickly.,Alice,1,

40000.0,960000.0,"Alice, I understand the appeal of a fair split, but consider our situation: waiting further will cost you much more due to inflation (20% per round for you). If you reject this offer, you'll be forced to propose in round 3 -- and by then your money will only be worth 64% of the nominal value. Accepting 40000 dollars now (worth 32000 in real terms for you) is much better than risking a drastically reduced value later. Let's agree now and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

300000.0,700000.0,I understand the inflation concern. How about a more favorable split for both of us? Let's agree on this before it gets worse.,Alice,3,

222000.0,778000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5, where due to inflation your nominal value drops to 40.96% of its original worth. In equilibrium, you would secure roughly 278000 nominal dollars then, which translates to about 113700 in effective terms. My offer gives you 222000 nominal dollars, which is worth approximately 113600 effective dollars at the current round's rate (0.512). To avoid further losses from inflation, I propose we agree now.",Bob,4,
