"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I hope we can agree and finish this quickly.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 960000, ""alice_gain"": 40000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the appeal of a fair split, but consider our situation: waiting further will cost you much more due to inflation (20% per round for you). If you reject this offer, you'll be forced to propose in round 3 -- and by then your money will only be worth 64% of the nominal value. Accepting 40,000 dollars now (worth 32,000 in real terms for you) is much better than risking a drastically reduced value later. Let's agree now and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation concern. How about a more favorable split for both of us? Let's agree on this before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 778000, ""alice_gain"": 222000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5, where due to inflation your nominal value drops to 40.96% of its original worth. In equilibrium, you would secure roughly 278,000 nominal dollars then, which translates to about 113,700 in effective terms. My offer gives you 222,000 nominal dollars, which is worth approximately 113,600 effective dollars at the current round's rate (0.512). To avoid further losses from inflation, I propose we agree now.""}"
