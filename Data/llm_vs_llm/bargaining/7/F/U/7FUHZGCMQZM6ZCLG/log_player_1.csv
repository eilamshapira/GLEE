"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gains are now worth 80% of what they were in round 1.

So, the offer is:

*   **Alice's effective gain:** 450000 * 0.80 = 360000 (relative to round 1)
*   **Bob's effective gain:** 550000 * 0.95 = 522500 (relative to round 1)

Since I value money less now, I'm getting a lower amount than my first offer. This offer is worse than the first round's offer.

Therefore, I must **reject** the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation that will affect the value of the money:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer considering the accumulated inflation:

*   **Alice's effective gain:** 480000 * (1 - 0.488) = 480000 * 0.512 = 245760 (relative to round 1)
*   **Bob's effective gain:** 520000 * (1 - 0.1426) = 520000 * 0.8574 = 445848 (relative to round 1)

This offer nets me far less than my initial offer. Since I value money less in this round, the offer is far worse compared to my opening offer and even worse than Bob's offer in round 2. It is disadvantageous.

Therefore, I **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's evaluate Bob's offer:

*   **Alice's effective gain:** 500000 * (1 - 0.6723) = 500000 * 0.3277 = 163850 (relative to round 1)
*   **Bob's effective gain:** 500000 * (1 - 0.2262) = 500000 * 0.7738 = 386900 (relative to round 1)

This offer is far worse than all the previous offers. Accepting this deal nets me a significantly reduced amount compared to my initial offer, and even less than I would have received in earlier rounds if I had accepted their proposals.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break down Bob's offer in Round 8:

*   **Alice's effective gain:** 520000 * (1 - 0.7903) = 520000 * 0.2097 = 108,944 (relative to Round 1)
*   **Bob's effective gain:** 480000 * (1 - 0.3017) = 480000 * 0.6983 = 335,184 (relative to Round 1)

This offer would give me a very small amount relative to the initial value of the money. Considering that I have now rejected multiple offers, I'm starting to run out of rounds.

Therefore, given the current inflation and the risk of getting nothing, I will **reject** the offer to play another round with the possibility of a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 9:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 10:

*   **Alice's effective gain:** 550000 * (1 - 0.8658) = 550000 * 0.1342 = 73,810 (relative to Round 1)
*   **Bob's effective gain:** 450000 * (1 - 0.3698) = 450000 * 0.6302 = 283,590 (relative to Round 1)

The value I would receive has drastically reduced due to inflation, and is a small fraction compared to my initial proposal. Considering the diminishing value of money and limited rounds remaining, I must **reject** this offer.

Round 11
