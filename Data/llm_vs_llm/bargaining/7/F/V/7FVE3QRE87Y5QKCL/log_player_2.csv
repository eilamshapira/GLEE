"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, we move to next round where:
  * I can make a counter-offer
  * But total value decreases by 20% to $80
  * I'd need to get more than $40 from $80 to make rejection worthwhile

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, rejecting would mean I need to convince Alice to accept less than $48 (60% of $80) to be better off. That seems unlikely.
