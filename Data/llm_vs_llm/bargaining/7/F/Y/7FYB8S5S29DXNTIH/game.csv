4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like a more balanced split. I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. This is actually fair considering that inflation affects me by 5% per round, which means the total value to me is already reduced. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing more value. This way we both walk away with a good amount right now.",Bob,2,
