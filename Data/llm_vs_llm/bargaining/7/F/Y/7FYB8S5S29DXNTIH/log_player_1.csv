"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time value of money, and we can both walk away with a good amount right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like a more balanced split. I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. This is actually fair considering that inflation affects me by 5% per round, which means the total value to me is already reduced. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing more value. This way we both walk away with a good amount right now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500, but with 20% inflation = $3600 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500, with 5% inflation = $5225 effective value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation (40% for me, 10% for Bob)
   * Any delay further reduces the real value of my share
   * Bob seems reasonable and aware of the inflation dynamics

Given that inflation hits me harder (20% vs 5%) and continuing would mean losing even more value, accepting this offer makes economic sense. While not ideal, it's better than risking further devaluation.
