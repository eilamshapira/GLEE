"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time value of money, and we can both walk away with a good amount right now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I take $4,000 while she gets $6,000 (a 40-60 split). If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $9,500 instead of $10,000.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. However, I need to balance that against the certainty of getting $4,000 now versus the risk of Alice rejecting my counter-offer and further inflation occurring.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and $4,000 is still a substantial amount, I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect while being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like a more balanced split. I'm offering you $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. This is actually fair considering that inflation affects me by 5% per round, which means the total value to me is already reduced. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing more value. This way we both walk away with a good amount right now.""}"
