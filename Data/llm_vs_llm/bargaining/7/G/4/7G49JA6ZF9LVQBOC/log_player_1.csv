"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both get a good deal. We have 10 rounds to go, the value of the money is decreasing, so let's not risk it further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
