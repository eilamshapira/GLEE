"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I value us both getting something rather than nothing. This gives me a little more to account for the inflation I'm facing, but still provides you with a solid return. Let's not risk losing everything. I propose 60 for me, 40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both get a good deal. We have 10 rounds to go, the value of the money is decreasing, so let's not risk it further.""}"
