"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50/50 split would be more fair. This gives us both $500000, and we can conclude this quickly before any potential inflation affects either of us. What do you say to an equal partnership? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
