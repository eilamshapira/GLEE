"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a generous offer. 60/40 split. This benefits both of us, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. Let's make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount
3. I don't lose anything to inflation yet
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but we'll burn one round

However, since Alice made the first move with a 60/40 split, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The split is too favorable for her, and since I don't face inflation pressure, I can afford to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while remaining diplomatic:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50/50 split would be more fair. This gives us both $500,000, and we can conclude this quickly before any potential inflation affects either of us. What do you say to an equal partnership?""}"
