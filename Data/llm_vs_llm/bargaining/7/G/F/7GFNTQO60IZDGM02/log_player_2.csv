"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer considering the inflation.

If I accept, I get $4000.

If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 90% for me. So, the total amount available to me effectively becomes $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000. In the next round, I will be making the offer.
Considering the offer, $4000 in the first round is a significant amount, and rejecting would mean relying on a potentially worse offer next round with a reduced principal.
