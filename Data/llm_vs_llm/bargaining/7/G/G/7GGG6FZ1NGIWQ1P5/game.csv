1000000.0,0.0,"Bob, here's my offer: I claim the full $1000000 now and you get $0. I know this may seem steep, but remember—in every subsequent round your dollars are worth only 80% of their face value. If you reject now and get to propose next round, any amount you secure will be discounted by 20%, leaving you effectively with nothing. With that in mind, please accept my proposal.",Alice,1,

200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was understandably aggressive. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing I take $800000, leaving you with a respectable $200000. Consider this: if you reject, the value decreases for me, pushing me to make even riskier demands in future rounds. It's in both our best interests to settle now.",Bob,2,

999999.0,1.0,"Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Remember, if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 4—but due to the inflation penalty you face (your dollars drop in value by 20% each round), you’ll essentially be forced to offer me nearly all of the pie in order to get me to agree. In other words, your best alternative would leave you with nothing of real value. I’ve given you a token amount—$1—to ensure you get something rather than nothing. Please accept this offer and let’s settle now.",Alice,3,

360000.0,640000.0,"Alice, it's clear you're aiming for a hefty share, but let's be pragmatic.  I'm proposing $640000 for me and $360000 for you.  This is a significant amount, even considering the inflation.  Rejecting this means risking everything on a future round where my offer might be less generous.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment. Let's end this now with a win-win scenario.",Bob,4,

200000.0,800000.0,"Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 5. Given the inflation discount you face—your money now is worth only 40.96% of its face value—rejecting this offer only guarantees that in Round 6, as the proposer, you would at best achieve an effective value of about 327680 (since a full dollar then is worth around 32.768% of its original value). By accepting this offer, you secure an effective value of 800000 × 0.4096 = 327680 immediately, which is equal to your best alternative but without further delay or risk. I believe this division is fair under the circumstances. I look forward to your agreement so we can conclude this matter now.",Alice,5,
