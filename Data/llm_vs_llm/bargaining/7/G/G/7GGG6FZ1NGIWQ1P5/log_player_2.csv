"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my offer: I claim the full $1000000 now and you get $0. I know this may seem steep, but remember—in every subsequent round your dollars are worth only 80% of their face value. If you reject now and get to propose next round, any amount you secure will be discounted by 20%, leaving you effectively with nothing. With that in mind, please accept my proposal. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic ultimatum game designed to exploit risk aversion. While it seems risky, rejecting this offer is crucial to getting a better deal. Alice is banking on Bob being too afraid of losing money to make a counter-proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was understandably aggressive. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing I take $800,000, leaving you with a respectable $200,000. Consider this: if you reject, the value decreases for me, pushing me to make even riskier demands in future rounds. It's in both our best interests to settle now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Remember, if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 4—but due to the inflation penalty you face (your dollars drop in value by 20% each round), you’ll essentially be forced to offer me nearly all of the pie in order to get me to agree. In other words, your best alternative would leave you with nothing of real value. I’ve given you a token amount—$1—to ensure you get something rather than nothing. Please accept this offer and let’s settle now. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing a tough game, but calling her bluff is necessary.  While my potential gains diminish each round, accepting a paltry $1 sets a terrible precedent and suggests I'm desperate. There's still a chance Alice will negotiate more fairly to avoid risking everything in a future round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 640000,
""alice_gain"": 360000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear you're aiming for a hefty share, but let's be pragmatic.  I'm proposing $640,000 for me and $360,000 for you.  This is a significant amount, even considering the inflation.  Rejecting this means risking everything on a future round where my offer might be less generous.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment. Let's end this now with a win-win scenario.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 5. Given the inflation discount you face—your money now is worth only 40.96% of its face value—rejecting this offer only guarantees that in Round 6, as the proposer, you would at best achieve an effective value of about 327680 (since a full dollar then is worth around 32.768% of its original value). By accepting this offer, you secure an effective value of 800000 × 0.4096 = 327680 immediately, which is equal to your best alternative but without further delay or risk. I believe this division is fair under the circumstances. I look forward to your agreement so we can conclude this matter now. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has presented a compelling case.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the impact of inflation is too significant to ignore. Accepting her offer guarantees me $800,000, which, after inflation, holds the same value as my most optimistic outcome in the next round.  It's not ideal, but it's the most logical choice at this point."
