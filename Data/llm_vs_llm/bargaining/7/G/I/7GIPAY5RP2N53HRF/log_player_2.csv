"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

Given the information:
- This is Round 1, so no inflation has occurred yet
- I would receive $500,000
- Alice would receive $500,000
- If I reject, inflation will reduce the money's value by 20% for me in the next round
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice

With inflation, if I reject and we reach agreement in Round 3, my $500,000 would be worth only $320,000 (after two 20% reductions).

This seems like a fair initial offer, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky for me.
