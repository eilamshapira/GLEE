Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""I think a significant share is fair for me, but there's still a good amount for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to avoid further loss in value. By accepting this offer, you'll secure $7550—worth $6040 to you today—better than risking even greater drops in the coming rounds. I believe this is a fair and smart way for both of us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 7550 
# Bob gain: 2450 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
