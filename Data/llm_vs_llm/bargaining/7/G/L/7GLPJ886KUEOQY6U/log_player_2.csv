Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2450, ""alice_gain"": 7550, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both want to avoid further loss in value. By accepting this offer, you'll secure $7,550—worth $6,040 to you today—better than risking even greater drops in the coming rounds. I believe this is a fair and smart way for both of us to close the deal. What do you say?""}"
