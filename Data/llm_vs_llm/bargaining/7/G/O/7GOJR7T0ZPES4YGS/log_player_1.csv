Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a fair approach. I'll take $45 and you get $55. This way, we both gain a bit more before inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  I'm sticking with my previous offer: $60 for me, $40 for you. Let's close this deal before inflation hurts us both further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, $48 for me and $52 for you seems like a win-win. Let's settle now while there's still value left for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking into account the inflation, getting $52 now is better than risking getting even less in the next round. Bob is unlikely to offer me more."
