"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid further inflation. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount of $10,000.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is clearly affecting us both. I'm proposing a 58/42 split as a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of my gain is 64% of the original (100% - 36% = 64%). So, the $4200 I would gain is equivalent to $4200 / 0.64 = $6562.5 in the original value.

Given this, I'll evaluate the offer.
