Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m starting us off with a proposal that reflects the future bargaining positions each of us would have if we delay. By accepting this division, you secure $310344.83 now instead of risking further depreciation (10% per round) if you wait for your turn to propose. Let’s settle quickly and avoid the discount downside. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 310344.83 
# Alice gain: 689655.17 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
