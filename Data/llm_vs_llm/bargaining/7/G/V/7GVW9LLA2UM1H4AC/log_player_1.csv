"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% vs my 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest this 60-40 split because:
1. It's better than equal to reflect my stronger negotiating position (lower inflation rate)
2. It's not too greedy, giving Bob a substantial portion to encourage acceptance
3. If Bob declines, his next round's money will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $475,000 (5% less)
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth $450,000 to him (10% less)
3. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * Further inflation will reduce value for both of us
   * I risk Bob rejecting again
4. The current offer, while not ideal, gives me a decent amount that's worth more than waiting
