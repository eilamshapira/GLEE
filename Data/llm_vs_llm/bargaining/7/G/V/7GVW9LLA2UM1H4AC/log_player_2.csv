"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer rationally. 

If I accept now, I get $400,000 while Alice gets $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll be facing a 10% inflation penalty (money is worth 10% less to me), while Alice faces only a 5% inflation penalty.

Given the significant inflation difference between us, and considering that $400,000 is a substantial amount, this isn't an unreasonable initial offer - though it does favor Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counterproposal that acknowledges our different inflation rates while seeking a more balanced division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. Since I face higher inflation (10% per round) compared to your 5%, a quick resolution benefits both of us, though me more significantly. This even split is fair and prevents further devaluation of our potential gains."
