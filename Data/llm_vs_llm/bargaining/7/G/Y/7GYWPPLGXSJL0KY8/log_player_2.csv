"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, the total amount will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 from my perspective.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I ask for more than 50%, I would still be dividing a ""smaller pie"" from my perspective due to inflation. For example, if I asked for 60% in round 2, that would be $60 of an amount that's now worth $80 to me, which equals $48 in round 1 dollars - less than the $50 I'm being offered now.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting the fair 50-50 split now is better than risking further negotiation.
