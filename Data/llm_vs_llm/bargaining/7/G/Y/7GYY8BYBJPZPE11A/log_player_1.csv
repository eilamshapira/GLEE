Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems reasonable considering the inflation risk is only on my end. Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. It's the fairest way for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation puts me at a significant disadvantage. I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? Slightly better for me than a straight split, considering the inflation is eating away at my share."" 
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a smaller margin than my initial offer but still gives me an advantage to compensate for the inflation risk. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable."
