"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you can get the full $100 if you wait, and since every extra round just shrinks my share further, I’d rather avoid unnecessary delay. I’m offering you the entire pie now so that you secure the full value immediately. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","A clever offer from Bob! However, I'm not convinced that I should accept an offer that gives him nothing. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth less with each passing round, so I'll try to make a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Your share is shrinking fast. This is a good deal for both of us.""}"
