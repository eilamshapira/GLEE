Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.83, ""bob_gain"": 79.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in light of how waiting devalues our money (20% for me and 5% for you per round), I’m offering you $79.17 now—which is exactly what you’d expect to receive if you waited to propose next round. Let’s both avoid further losses and agree on this division.""}"
