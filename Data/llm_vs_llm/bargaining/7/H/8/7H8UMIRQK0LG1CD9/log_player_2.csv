"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of how waiting devalues our money (20% for me and 5% for you per round), I’m offering you $79.17 now—which is exactly what you’d expect to receive if you waited to propose next round. Let’s both avoid further losses and agree on this division. 
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
