6500.0,3500.0,"I'm losing value significantly each round. I'm offering you 35%. Take it now, or we both risk losing everything.",Alice,5,

6500.0,3500.0,We're down to the wire. Let's settle on 35% for me and 65% for you. It's our best shot at walking away with something before it's too late.,Bob,10,
