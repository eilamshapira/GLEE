"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since there's 5% inflation with each round, it's better to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by settling now."
