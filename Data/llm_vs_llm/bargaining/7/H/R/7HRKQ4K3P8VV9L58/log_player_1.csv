"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is Alice's first offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob $40 in the first round, keeping $60 for myself. This gives me a slight advantage, recognizing I am the proposer and accounting for the potential inflation down the line. I hope Bob finds this reasonable and accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My $60 from the previous round would now be worth $48. Bob's gain of $55 is only worth 5% less, making it $52.25. Considering the inflation effect on me, and the fact that we're only in the second round, I will reject the offer and try to bargain for a better deal in the future.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. I need to factor in the increasing inflation on my gains. This round, my money is worth 40% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth 10% less than round 1. To make this work, I need to be more generous to Bob to encourage acceptance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

I am offering Bob $48, which should be appealing since its value has only decreased by 10%. I am keeping $52, but that's already worth 40% less to me than the original dollar. I hope this offer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting tricky. My gains are worth 48.8% less, and Bob's are worth 14.26% less. Bob is offering me $42. Let's consider the real value.

$42 * (1 - 0.488) = $42 * 0.512 = $21.50 approximately.

Bob gets $58 * (1 - 0.1426) = $58 * 0.8574 = $49.73 approximately.

Bob is still getting significantly more real value than I am. While time is running out, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this and hope to make a winning offer next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, Round 5. The pressure is on. My gains are worth even less now. I need to make a more tempting offer to Bob.

My money is now worth 54.94% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth 18.86% less.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 49,
  ""bob_gain"": 51
}
```

I am offering Bob $51. This should be very attractive to him given its relatively high value retention (only 18.86% loss). I am keeping $49, which is worth significantly less to me. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope Bob recognizes this and accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting critical. My money is worth 67.23% less, and Bob's is worth 22.62% less. Bob is offering me $40. Let's calculate the real values:

My gain: $40 * (1 - 0.6723) = $40 * 0.3277 = $13.11 approximately.

Bob's gain: $60 * (1 - 0.2262) = $60 * 0.7738 = $46.43 approximately.

This is a terrible deal for me. However, we are halfway through the rounds, and I'm running out of time. If I reject, I risk getting even less in the future, or nothing at all if we reach round 12. I need to carefully consider this. Given the severe inflation affecting me, I think I should accept this offer to guarantee at least some return.
