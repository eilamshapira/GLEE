60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair offer considering future inflation for me. Take 40% now.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"I think a 50-50 split is the fairest option. This way we both get an equal share, and there's no need to lose value by delaying further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Inflation is hurting me more. I need 65, you still get a good 35.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Since inflation doesn't affect me but appears to affect you, I understand your concern. However, I still need a fair deal. I'm offering you 45, which is still substantial, while I get 55. This is reasonable considering we're now in round 4 and time is passing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"I am losing value fast! Take 30, or we risk losing it all.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I understand inflation is affecting you, but we need to find a reasonable compromise. I'm offering you 40 and I'll take 60. This is fair considering inflation doesn't affect me at all, and we're now halfway through our possible rounds. Let's agree now rather than risk getting nothing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"This is my final offer. I need 75 to compensate for the massive inflation I'm experiencing. You're not affected, so please take 25 and let's be done with this before we both lose everything.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
35.0,65.0,"I understand you're experiencing significant inflation, but I'm not affected by it at all. Given this asymmetry, I'm offering you 35 and I'll take 65. This is actually generous considering your money is worth much less to you while mine retains full value. We're in round 8 of 12 - we need to reach an agreement soon or we both get nothing.",Bob,8,
