"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer considering future inflation for me. Take 40% now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me 40$ while keeping 60$ for herself, which isn't an equal split. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice but I know it doesn't affect me (0% inflation), I might be able to get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest option. This way we both get an equal share, and there's no need to lose value by delaying further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more. I need 65, you still get a good 35. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer. She's now offering me 35$ while keeping 65$ for herself, which is an even less favorable split for me than her first offer. She claims inflation is hurting her, but I know that inflation doesn't affect me (0%), and I can make another counter-offer in the next round to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Since inflation doesn't affect me but appears to affect you, I understand your concern. However, I still need a fair deal. I'm offering you 45, which is still substantial, while I get 55. This is reasonable considering we're now in round 4 and time is passing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I am losing value fast! Take 30, or we risk losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's now offering me 30$ while keeping 70$ for herself, which is an even worse split than her previous offers. She claims she's losing value fast due to inflation, but I know inflation doesn't affect me at all (0%). We're only in round 5 of 12 possible rounds, so there's still plenty of time to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I understand inflation is affecting you, but we need to find a reasonable compromise. I'm offering you 40 and I'll take 60. This is fair considering inflation doesn't affect me at all, and we're now halfway through our possible rounds. Let's agree now rather than risk getting nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I need 75 to compensate for the massive inflation I'm experiencing. You're not affected, so please take 25 and let's be done with this before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She's now offering me only 25$ while keeping 75$ for herself, claiming she needs to compensate for massive inflation. While inflation is clearly affecting her significantly (73.79% less value than round 1), it doesn't affect me at all. We're in round 7 of 12, so we still have 5 more potential rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""I understand you're experiencing significant inflation, but I'm not affected by it at all. Given this asymmetry, I'm offering you 35 and I'll take 65. This is actually generous considering your money is worth much less to you while mine retains full value. We're in round 8 of 12 - we need to reach an agreement soon or we both get nothing.""}"
