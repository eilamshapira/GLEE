40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than half. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and we can settle before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but I believe we can do better. Given that I remain unaffected by inflation and will have the next opportunity to propose, I’m opting to pass on your current division. Let's move to the next round and try to work out a fairer split.",Alice,2,reject
47.0,53.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal: I get $47 and you get $53. While I enjoy full value, I know the inflation is eating into the value of funds on your side even faster. Accepting this offer now delivers around $42.4 of effective value for you—likely better than the further discounted outcome if we delay. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation!",Alice,3,
