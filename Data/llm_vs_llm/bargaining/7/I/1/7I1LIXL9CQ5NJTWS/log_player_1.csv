"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 equally—$50 for each of us. Accepting now avoids any potential inflation issues, so let's settle this quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than half. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and we can settle before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your revised offer, but I believe we can do better. Given that I remain unaffected by inflation and will have the next opportunity to propose, I’m opting to pass on your current division. Let's move to the next round and try to work out a fairer split.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 47, ""bob_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal: I get $47 and you get $53. While I enjoy full value, I know the inflation is eating into the value of funds on your side even faster. Accepting this offer now delivers around $42.4 of effective value for you—likely better than the further discounted outcome if we delay. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation!""}"
