"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 equally—$50 for each of us. Accepting now avoids any potential inflation issues, so let's settle this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than half. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and we can settle before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal: I get $47 and you get $53. While I enjoy full value, I know the inflation is eating into the value of funds on your side even faster. Accepting this offer now delivers around $42.4 of effective value for you—likely better than the further discounted outcome if we delay. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation! 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
