"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and it gives you a substantial $4,000.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount while considering the diminishing value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $4,500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4,050
* If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth 20% less for me
* Bob's current offer is reasonable considering the inflation effects
* Continuing further rounds will only decrease the real value for both of us
