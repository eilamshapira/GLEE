"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me is now 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.
The value of the money for Alice is now 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

I'll make an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is 4200 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $3402.
The actual value of the money Alice would gain is 5800 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $3712.

Given that the values are decreasing rapidly, I think it's a relatively fair offer.
