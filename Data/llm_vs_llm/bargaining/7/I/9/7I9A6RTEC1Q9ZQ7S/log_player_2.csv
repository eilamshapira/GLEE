"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, where each of us would get $5,000. This is a fair division at face value, but I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total value would effectively be $8,000 from my perspective. Even with a better percentage split in the next round, the absolute amount might end up lower due to this inflation.

A guaranteed $5,000 now is better than the possibility of getting less value later, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Alice. I should accept this fair offer.
