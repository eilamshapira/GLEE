550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to settle now rather than go to another round. This is a reasonable division that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the game dynamics.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable as the value of the money decreases faster for me. It's in both our interests to settle now, and I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for the higher depreciation rate.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be strategic about this. We're both losing money with each round - you're now facing 40% depreciation on your next turn while I'm at 10%. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after another round of 20% inflation. Remember, if we keep going, the total value for both of us diminishes significantly. This is the optimal time to agree.",Alice,3,
