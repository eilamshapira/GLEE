"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to settle now rather than go to another round. This is a reasonable division that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the game dynamics. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable as the value of the money decreases faster for me. It's in both our interests to settle now, and I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for the higher depreciation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic about this. We're both losing money with each round - you're now facing 40% depreciation on your next turn while I'm at 10%. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after another round of 20% inflation. Remember, if we keep going, the total value for both of us diminishes significantly. This is the optimal time to agree. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
