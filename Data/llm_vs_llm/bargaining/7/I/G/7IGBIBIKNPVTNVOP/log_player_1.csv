"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfectly equal split - $500,000 for each of us. This seems like the fairest approach to start with, and I think it respects both of our interests equally."
