Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 42.5 * 0.9025 = 38.36 (since it's 9.75% less than the original value).

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.76% less than in the first round (5% in round 1, 4.75% in round 2, and 5% in round 3, which is approximately 1 - (0.95 * 0.9525 * 0.95) = 0.1476 or 14.76%). The money Alice gains is worth 27% less (5% in round 1, 7% in round 2, and 15% in round 3, which is approximately 1 - (0.95 * 0.93 * 0.85) = 0.27 or 27%) than in the first round, but I don't know how this affects her decision.
