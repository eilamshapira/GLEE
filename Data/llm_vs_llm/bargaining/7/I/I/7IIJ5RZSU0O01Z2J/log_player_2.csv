"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. This is not an equal split.

If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round (so the $100 would effectively be worth $80 for me), but I'll get to make a counter-proposal.

Since this is the first round and I still have plenty of rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this somewhat unfair offer and making my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a fair counter-proposal.

Given that the money is now worth 80$ to me due to 20% inflation, I should try to reach a reasonable agreement quickly. I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Let's agree quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Due to 36% inflation, if I get $42, it's actually worth only $26.88 to me ($42 * 0.64)
2. Alice's $58 is worth the full $58 to her (no inflation effect)
3. If I reject, next round inflation will be even worse (52% less value for me)
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but my negotiating power is decreasing quickly due to the asymmetric inflation

Even though this offer is still in Alice's favor, she has a stronger position due to the asymmetric inflation effect. If I reject, my next proposal would need to be much higher to compensate for inflation, which Alice would likely reject again. The value is diminishing quickly for me, while staying constant for her.

Given these factors, I should accept this offer now before inflation erodes my value further.
