"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a relatively balanced split, but taking into account that Bob's money loses value each round while mine doesn't. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, his share will be worth 20% less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $50 is actually worth only $40 to him (80% of $50)
3. My $50 would still be worth the full $50
4. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
5. While I could try to leverage this to get more in the next round, this current 50-50 offer is quite reasonable

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair deal where I get $50 at full value, and I avoid the risk of prolonging negotiations which might lead to a worse outcome."
