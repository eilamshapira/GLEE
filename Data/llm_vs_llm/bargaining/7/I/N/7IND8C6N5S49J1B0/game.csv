60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's kick this off quickly. I propose a split where I receive $60 and you get $40. I believe it's fair to secure our shares early, given the diminishing value as rounds pass. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to hold out. Given the inflation only affects your share while mine remains stable, waiting might give me a more favorable division next round. Let's continue the game.",Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, considering that every additional round deepens the inflation hit on your share (now at 20% devaluation), I'm offering a 60/40 split: I take $60 and you get $40 nominally (which is effectively $32 this round). This deal protects you from even harsher devaluation in later rounds. I believe it's a fair way to close the deal now before things drop further. What do you say?",Alice,3,
