"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's kick this off quickly. I propose a split where I receive $60 and you get $40. I believe it's fair to secure our shares early, given the diminishing value as rounds pass. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to hold out. Given the inflation only affects your share while mine remains stable, waiting might give me a more favorable division next round. Let's continue the game.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering that every additional round deepens the inflation hit on your share (now at 20% devaluation), I'm offering a 60/40 split: I take $60 and you get $40 nominally (which is effectively $32 this round). This deal protects you from even harsher devaluation in later rounds. I believe it's a fair way to close the deal now before things drop further. What do you say?""}"
