"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's kick this off quickly. I propose a split where I receive $60 and you get $40. I believe it's fair to secure our shares early, given the diminishing value as rounds pass. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that every additional round deepens the inflation hit on your share (now at 20% devaluation), I'm offering a 60/40 split: I take $60 and you get $40 nominally (which is effectively $32 this round). This deal protects you from even harsher devaluation in later rounds. I believe it's a fair way to close the deal now before things drop further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
