"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the inflation affecting our share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. It's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money. Let's settle soon! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. With inflation reducing my share's value by 5%, $45 now is worth $42.75
2. Waiting another round would make any future gains worth even less
3. Bob's offer is relatively fair, and continuing to negotiate could lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within the rounds limit
4. Since Bob's share is affected by 20% inflation, he has a strong incentive to reach an agreement quickly, which means future offers might not be better than this one"
