"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This is completely fair, and accepting now means we both get maximum value since inflation will reduce the money's worth in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing an equal split of $50 each, which is generally considered fair in these situations. She's also correct that inflation could reduce the value in future rounds, though it's worth noting that for me, the inflation is 0% (meaning there's no penalty for me to go to future rounds).

Since this is a balanced first offer that gives me half of the total amount, and there's no strategic advantage for me to delay since I don't face inflation penalties:
