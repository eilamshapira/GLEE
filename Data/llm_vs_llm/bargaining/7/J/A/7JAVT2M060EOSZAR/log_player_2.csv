"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Note that with each round, your money loses 20% value while mine only loses 5%, so it's in your interest to accept reasonable offers early. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is correct that I'm at a disadvantage with the higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%). If I reject this round:
- Next round my 5000 would only be worth 4000 (20% less)
- While her 5000 would be worth 4750 (5% less)

The 50-50 split is a fair starting offer, and given my worse inflation rate, delaying would likely result in worse outcomes for me. Even if I could negotiate for a bit more in the next round, the 20% loss would probably offset any gains.
