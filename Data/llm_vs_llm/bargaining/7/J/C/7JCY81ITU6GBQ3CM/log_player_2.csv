"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $5500 and Alice $4500, it seems like a decent starting point. Considering the inflation factor, if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to Alice, but the same to me. However, I also need to think about the potential risks of waiting.

For now, I think I'll accept this offer, as it gives me a slight advantage and avoids the risk of losing value in future rounds.
