60.0,40.0,Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
76.83,23.17,"Alice, by moving forward now you preserve more of your share’s value. If you wait until round 3, your money will lose another 5% in value. Accepting this offer gives you about $73 in effective value—certainly better than risking further devaluation. Let's settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer was too low. Let's be reasonable. 75/25 still gives you a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
95.0,5.0,"Alice, I know that waiting comes at a cost for you. At this round, your $95 will be worth about 95 × 0.8574 = roughly $81.45 in actual value—no worse than what you could secure by waiting until round 5, and likely with less risk. Let's settle now and preserve as much value as possible for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
80.0,20.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. 80/20 is the most reasonable split. If you reject this, I'm willing to risk it all. Consider your options carefully.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
90.5,9.5,"Alice, I appreciate our process so far. In round 6 your money is worth about 77.38% of its face value—meaning that 90.50 dollars in this round translates to roughly 70 dollars in first‐round value. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 7, but your share will be discounted further (down to about 73.5% of nominal), likely leaving you with an effective value near or below 70 dollars. Accepting this offer protects your value and avoids further erosion. Let's settle now for both our sakes.",Bob,6,
