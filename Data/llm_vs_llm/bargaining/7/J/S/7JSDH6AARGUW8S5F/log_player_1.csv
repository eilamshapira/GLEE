Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by moving forward now you preserve more of your share’s value. If you wait until round 3, your money will lose another 5% in value. Accepting this offer gives you about $73 in effective value—certainly better than risking further devaluation. Let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 76.83 
# Bob gain: 23.17 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that waiting comes at a cost for you. At this round, your $95 will be worth about 95 × 0.8574 = roughly $81.45 in actual value—no worse than what you could secure by waiting until round 5, and likely with less risk. Let's settle now and preserve as much value as possible for both of us.

# Bob gain: 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate our process so far. In round 6 your money is worth about 77.38% of its face value—meaning that 90.50 dollars in this round translates to roughly 70 dollars in first‐round value. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 7, but your share will be discounted further (down to about 73.5% of nominal), likely leaving you with an effective value near or below 70 dollars. Accepting this offer protects your value and avoids further erosion. Let's settle now for both our sakes. 
# Alice gain: 90.5 
# Bob gain: 9.5
