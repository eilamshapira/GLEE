"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 23.17, ""alice_gain"": 76.83, ""message"": ""Alice, by moving forward now you preserve more of your share’s value. If you wait until round 3, your money will lose another 5% in value. Accepting this offer gives you about $73 in effective value—certainly better than risking further devaluation. Let's settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer was too low. Let's be reasonable. 75/25 still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5, ""alice_gain"": 95, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that waiting comes at a cost for you. At this round, your $95 will be worth about 95 × 0.8574 = roughly $81.45 in actual value—no worse than what you could secure by waiting until round 5, and likely with less risk. Let's settle now and preserve as much value as possible for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. 80/20 is the most reasonable split. If you reject this, I'm willing to risk it all. Consider your options carefully. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9.5, ""alice_gain"": 90.5, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate our process so far. In round 6 your money is worth about 77.38% of its face value—meaning that 90.50 dollars in this round translates to roughly 70 dollars in first‐round value. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 7, but your share will be discounted further (down to about 73.5% of nominal), likely leaving you with an effective value near or below 70 dollars. Accepting this offer protects your value and avoids further erosion. Let's settle now for both our sakes.""}"
