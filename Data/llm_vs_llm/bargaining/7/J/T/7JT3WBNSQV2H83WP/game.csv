55.0,45.0,"Alice, to avoid further delays (and the 5% inflation hit to my share), I propose a nearly even split. I believe 45 for me and 55 for you is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away quickly. What do you think?",Bob,2,

57.0,43.0,Meet in the middle of our previous offers,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
53.0,47.0,"Alice, I recognize that delays hurt us bothâ€”my money is eroding faster, and I suspect yours might be impacted too. In light of our previous rounds, I propose 47 for me and 53 for you. Settling now lets us both secure better value than further postponement would allow. Let's agree and wrap this up.",Bob,4,
