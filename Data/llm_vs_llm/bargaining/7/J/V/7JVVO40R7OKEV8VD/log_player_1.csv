"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I offer Bob $520,000 and I'll take $480,000. This is a fair division with a small incentive for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unbalanced in Bob's favor. I'll make a more equitable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a balanced split that's still appealing but ensures I get a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

I'm offering Bob $510,000 and keeping $490,000. This is a very fair split with Bob still getting the larger share. It's more balanced than the previous offers and should be acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While Bob is still getting a larger share, the split is reasonably fair and we're already in round 4. It's better to secure a good outcome now than risk worse offers or potentially losing everything if we run out of rounds."
