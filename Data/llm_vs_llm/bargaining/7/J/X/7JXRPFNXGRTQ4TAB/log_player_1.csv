"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $40 and you get $60. Remember, every round I lose 20% in value while you don't, so let's wrap this up now. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm willing to take $70 and give you $30. Since the value decreases for you each round, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risking a lower value later. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
