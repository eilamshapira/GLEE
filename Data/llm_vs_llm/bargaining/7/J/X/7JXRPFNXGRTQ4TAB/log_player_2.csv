"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $40 and you get $60. Remember, every round I lose 20% in value while you don't, so let's wrap this up now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm willing to take $70 and give you $30. Since the value decreases for you each round, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risking a lower value later.""}"
