"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1687.07, ""bob_gain"": 8312.93, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for a prompt agreement I propose the following split: I receive $1,687.07 and you receive $8,312.93. Given that if we delay further the money’s value falls—20% per round for me and 5% per round for you—and considering there are only 12 rounds in total, this division reflects our respective positions in the backward‐induction equilibrium. In later rounds you would have a clear advantage as proposer, but waiting hurts my share significantly. I hope you see the fairness in this offer and agree to settle now.""}"
