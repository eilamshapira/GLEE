Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for a prompt agreement I propose the following split: I receive $1687.07 and you receive $8312.93. Given that if we delay further the money’s value falls—20% per round for me and 5% per round for you—and considering there are only 12 rounds in total, this division reflects our respective positions in the backward‐induction equilibrium. In later rounds you would have a clear advantage as proposer, but waiting hurts my share significantly. I hope you see the fairness in this offer and agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 8312.93 
# Alice gain: 1687.07 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split offered:
   - My share: $8,312.93 (83.13%)
   - Alice's share: $1,687.07 (16.87%)

2. Key considerations:
   - The offer is quite favorable to me
   - Inflation impact:
     - My loss per round: 5%
     - Alice's loss per round: 20%
   - Alice is correct that delay hurts her more than me
   - First round opportunity to lock in a very good deal

3. Decision rationale:
   - This is an excellent offer for me
   - Getting over 83% of the total amount is very favorable
   - No strategic advantage in waiting as I'm unlikely to get a better deal
   - Risk of losing value through inflation if I reject
