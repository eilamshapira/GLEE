45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since you face 10% inflation per round but I don't, this offer of $45 is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This way we both get a fair share and can conclude our deal quickly.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Considering inflation, this is my final fair offer",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, consider that with each round your share loses more value due to the 10% inflation. At this point, you're facing a 27.1% total inflation in the next round. This 60/40 split is fair considering I have no inflation penalty, while you do. Accepting this now is better than further decreases in value for you.",Bob,4,
