Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since you face 10% inflation per round but I don't, this offer of $45 is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This way we both get a fair share and can conclude our deal quickly.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that with each round your share loses more value due to the 10% inflation. At this point, you're facing a 27.1% total inflation in the next round. This 60/40 split is fair considering I have no inflation penalty, while you do. Accepting this now is better than further decreases in value for you.

# Bob gain: 60
