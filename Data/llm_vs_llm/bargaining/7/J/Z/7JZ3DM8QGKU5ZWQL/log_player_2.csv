"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's be friends 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but I should also consider the inflation mechanic.

For me, there's no inflation penalty - my money keeps the same value in future rounds. For Alice, her money loses 10% value each round. If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer, she might be incentivized to accept a different split due to this inflation.

Since I don't lose value in future rounds, I can afford to negotiate for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation mechanic while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since you face 10% inflation per round but I don't, this offer of $45 is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. This way we both get a fair share and can conclude our deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is my final fair offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's revised offer. She's now offering me $42 out of $100, which is only slightly better than her initial offer of $40. 

While Alice does face an inflation penalty (19% less value for her now), I'm still not getting what I consider a fair share. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can continue negotiating without losing value in future rounds.

Alice's inflation will increase to 27.1% in the next round, which gives me more leverage for the next offer I make.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, consider that with each round your share loses more value due to the 10% inflation. At this point, you're facing a 27.1% total inflation in the next round. This 60/40 split is fair considering I have no inflation penalty, while you do. Accepting this now is better than further decreases in value for you.""}"
