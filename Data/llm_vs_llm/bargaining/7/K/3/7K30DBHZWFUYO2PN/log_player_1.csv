"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair and balanced offer to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $100, which gives us each $50. This is the fairest division and avoids the risk of losing value through inflation in later rounds."
