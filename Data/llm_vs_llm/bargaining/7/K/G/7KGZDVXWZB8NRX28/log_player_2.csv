"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and I think we should agree quickly because with inflation, the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'd make the offer but the total value would be reduced by 10% due to inflation on my end.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and each round decreases the money's value to me by 10%, it makes sense to accept reasonable offers early. A 50-50 split is fair, and waiting would only decrease my potential gain.
