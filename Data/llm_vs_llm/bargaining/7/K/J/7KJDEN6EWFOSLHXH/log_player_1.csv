"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division and ensures we both walk away with an equal share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3 and the money is worth another 10% less, I'll adjust my approach.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. Since we're facing continued inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to lose value. This slight adjustment from my initial 50-50 offer acknowledges the strategic aspect of the negotiation while still being relatively fair."
