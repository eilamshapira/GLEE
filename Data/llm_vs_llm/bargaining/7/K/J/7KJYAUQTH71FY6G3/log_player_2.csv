"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me
2. The money will be worth 5% less to Alice
3. I'd have control over the proposal

While 40% isn't terrible, given that I have negotiating leverage (Alice loses less value per round), I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I need to make a strategic counter-offer. The money is now worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. Given that Alice loses value more slowly than I do, I should make a reasonable offer to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""A fair 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. We both benefit from agreeing now rather than losing value in further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you, but act fast, inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased my share from $400k to $420k
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $420k is actually worth $420k * 0.81 = $340,200 (in round 1 value)
   * If I wait another round, the money will be worth 29% less for me
3. Alice is signaling awareness of the inflation pressure
4. The difference between this and future rounds will likely be diminished by inflation

Given that:
- The real value I'm getting is already significantly reduced
- Another round would mean even more severe depreciation
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate but likely won't go much higher
- I'm losing value faster than Alice (10% vs 5% per round)

I should accept this offer before it loses more value.
