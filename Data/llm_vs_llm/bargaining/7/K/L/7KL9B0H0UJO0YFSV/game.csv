5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and given that your inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs 5%), it makes sense to agree quickly rather than dragging this out and losing value.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think this is a fair split, given my higher inflation rate.  We can both still get a good share, and I'd prefer to finish this quickly.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but my proposal is actually better for both of us. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value. With your 20% inflation rate, waiting just one more round means your $6000 would be worth only $4800 in round 1 terms. My offer gives you $4500 now, which is better than waiting and getting less. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,3,
