"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, taking into account the different inflation rates that affect us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and given that your inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs 5%), it makes sense to agree quickly rather than dragging this out and losing value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given my higher inflation rate.  We can both still get a good share, and I'd prefer to finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but my proposal is actually better for both of us. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value. With your 20% inflation rate, waiting just one more round means your $6000 would be worth only $4800 in round 1 terms. My offer gives you $4500 now, which is better than waiting and getting less. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit.""}"
