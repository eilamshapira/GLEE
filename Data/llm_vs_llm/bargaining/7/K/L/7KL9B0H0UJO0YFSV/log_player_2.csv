"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and given that your inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs 5%), it makes sense to agree quickly rather than dragging this out and losing value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, given my higher inflation rate.  We can both still get a good share, and I'd prefer to finish this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate, but my proposal is actually better for both of us. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value. With your 20% inflation rate, waiting just one more round means your $6000 would be worth only $4800 in round 1 terms. My offer gives you $4500 now, which is better than waiting and getting less. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
