"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that Bob has the power to reject and make a counter-offer, and I need to account for potential inflation if this goes to more rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'd like to add: ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is reasonably fair while accounting for potential inflation risk."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
* I would actually get $50 * 0.95 = $47.50 in round 1 value
* Bob's offer is less favorable than my initial proposal
* However, if I reject, the next round will have another 5% inflation, and we might end up in a back-and-forth that costs us both

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further inflation and potential deadlock makes this 50-50 offer reasonable enough to accept.
