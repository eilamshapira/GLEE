"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for herself
2. Due to the 10% inflation penalty per round for Alice, her money will be worth less each round
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't lose value by waiting
5. This first offer is very unfavorable to me, giving me only 10% of the total

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has a 10% inflation penalty per round and I don't, I have some leverage, but I still want to make a reasonable offer that she's likely to accept to avoid a long negotiation.

A fair split would account for the fact that her money will be worth 10% less this round. I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a bit more than half but isn't too aggressive.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me $600,000 and Alice $400,000. My reasoning to share with Alice is that since her money is worth 10% less this round (so her $400,000 is effectively worth $360,000 to her), we should adjust the split accordingly. This is much more equitable than her initial offer while accounting for the inflation penalty she faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $100,000 to $300,000
2. The inflation penalty for Alice is now 19%, meaning her $700,000 would be worth approximately $567,000 to her
3. My $300,000 would still be worth full value
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and Alice's penalty will keep increasing
5. This offer is still quite unbalanced, giving me only 30% of the total
6. I can make a better counter-offer next round, and Alice's position will weaken further due to inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering Alice's increasing inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the current situation:

1. Alice's money is now subject to a significant inflation penalty
2. We need to reach an agreement within 8 more rounds
3. I should make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept while maximizing my position

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

My reasoning to share with Alice: With the current inflation penalty of around 19%, your $350,000 would be worth about $283,500 to you. I'm offering you a substantial amount that, even with the inflation penalty, still gives you a significant share. This is a fair offer considering the inflation effect, and we should reach an agreement soon to prevent further value loss on your side. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less in each round due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to the 34.39% inflation penalty, her $500,000 would actually be worth about $328,050 to her
3. My $500,000 would still be worth full value
4. This is a significant improvement from her previous offers
5. If I reject, we still have 7 rounds left, but the risk of not reaching an agreement increases
6. This is actually a pretty good offer for me, as I get full value on my half while she takes a significant inflation hit on hers

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
- It's a fair nominal split (50-50)
- Due to inflation, I'm actually getting the better end of the deal
- Further negotiation might lead to deteriorating cooperation
- The risk of not reaching an agreement and getting nothing is not worth it"
