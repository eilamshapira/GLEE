"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the diminishing value due to inflation with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is close to a fair split while giving me a slight advantage since I'm making the first offer."
