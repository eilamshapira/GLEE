"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk losing value to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $4,500 (no inflation impact for me)
   * Bob gets $5,500 (but worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $5,225 for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But Bob will face even more inflation in the next round
   * However, Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds

The offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of further rounds reducing the total value for Bob, which might make him less cooperative.
