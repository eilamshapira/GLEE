"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 60-40 split, where I (Bob) would get 400,000$ and she would get 600,000$.

I need to consider if this is a good deal or if I should reject and make a counter-offer. The key consideration is that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects Alice (10% per round).

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will decrease, and this asymmetric inflation means my negotiating position weakens more quickly than Alice's.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fact that this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
