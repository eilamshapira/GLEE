"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - But I get to make the next offer

$400,000 right now is better than a higher amount that will be worth less due to the steep 20% inflation penalty per round. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential continued negotiation makes this a reasonable offer.
