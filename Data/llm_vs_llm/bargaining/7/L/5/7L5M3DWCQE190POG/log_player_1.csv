"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation impact I'll face if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
// I reject because even with 10% inflation my previous offer of 6000 would still be worth 5400, which is better than Bob's offer of 4500. I'll make a new offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. With inflation affecting both of us, we should reach an agreement quickly. This 55-45 split is fair and gives you a good amount while protecting both of us from further inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think a 58-42 split is reasonable. We should reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
// While not ideal, with inflation now at 27.1%, my $4200 is better than continuing to negotiate while the value keeps decreasing. If I rejected, my next counter-offer of $5500 would be worth only about $4009 after inflation (5500 * 0.729), which is worse than accepting $4200 now."
