"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the effective value for me in Round 2. The money is worth 20% less than in round 1, so $1 in Round 2 is worth $0.80 in Round 1 terms.

My offer in round 1 was $60. In Round 2, the offer is $45.
The effective value of $45 for me is 45 * 0.80 = 36 in round 1 terms.

Given that my previous offer was 60 for me, and with the inflation, now the effective value is 36, it is better to accept.
