"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that delaying would cost me 10% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still quite fair and gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my first-mover advantage. If Bob rejects this, they'll make a counter-offer but I'll lose 10% value in the next round, so this offer benefits both of us to conclude quickly."
