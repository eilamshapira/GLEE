"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreased value of money over rounds and still offers you a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than original value
- In the first round I asked for $60 and was rejected
- Bob seems to be more affected by inflation (20% for him)

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and this is still a reasonable split.
