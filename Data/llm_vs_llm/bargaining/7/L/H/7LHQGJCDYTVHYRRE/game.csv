344827.0,655173.0,"Hello Bob, I propose that I receive $344827 and you receive $655173. Given that my money loses value 10% each round while yours only 5%, this split reflects our relative time sensitivities. I believe accepting this offer immediately is in both our best interests. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,
