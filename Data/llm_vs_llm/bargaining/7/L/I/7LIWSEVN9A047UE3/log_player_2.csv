"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- It's a perfectly equal 50-50 split
- It's fair and reasonable
- Getting $500,000 is a significant amount
- If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
- Starting with an aggressive counter-offer might lead to a standoff
- There are limited rounds, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree

Given these considerations, I'll accept this fair opening offer.
