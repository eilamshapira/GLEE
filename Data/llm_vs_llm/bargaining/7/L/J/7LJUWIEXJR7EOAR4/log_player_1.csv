"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I should get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the $40 offered is equivalent to $40 * 0.9 = $36.

I don't think this is a fair offer, especially since the money will continue to depreciate in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own losses.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100%.
In Round 2, the money was worth 90% for me and 95% for Bob.
In Round 3, the money is worth 81% for me (0.9 * 0.9) and 90.25% for Bob (0.95 * 0.95).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm holding firm. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The money I gain is worth 72.9% of its original value (1 - 0.271), so the $40 offered is equivalent to $40 * 0.729 = $29.16.

The money Bob gains is worth 85.74% of its original value (1 - 0.1426), so the $60 offered to him is equivalent to $60 * 0.8574 = $51.44.

I still don't think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to wait for a better deal or try to negotiate again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has been holding firm on his previous offers, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to him while still being mindful of my own losses.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100%.
In Round 2, the money was worth 90% for me and 95% for Bob.
In Round 3, the money was worth 81% for me and 90.25% for Bob.
In Round 4, the money was worth 72.9% for me and 85.74% for Bob.
In Round 5, the money is worth 65.61% for me (0.729 * 0.9) and 81.67% for Bob (0.8574 * 0.95).

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. It's time to find a compromise.""}"
