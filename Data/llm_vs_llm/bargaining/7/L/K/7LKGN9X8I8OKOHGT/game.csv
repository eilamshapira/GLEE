55.0,45.0,"Hey Bob, I suggest we divide the money 55/45 in this first round. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement quickly. What do you think?",Alice,1,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm compromising from my original position. Let's meet in the middle with a 52/48 split. Both of us are affected by inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. The longer we wait, the less value we both get. This is a fair offer considering our situation.",Alice,3,
