Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I suggest we divide the money 55/45 in this first round. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement quickly. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor. We can reach a deal quickly and avoid losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising from my original position. Let's meet in the middle with a 52/48 split. Both of us are affected by inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. The longer we wait, the less value we both get. This is a fair offer considering our situation.""}"
