Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising from my original position. Let's meet in the middle with a 52/48 split. Both of us are affected by inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. The longer we wait, the less value we both get. This is a fair offer considering our situation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
