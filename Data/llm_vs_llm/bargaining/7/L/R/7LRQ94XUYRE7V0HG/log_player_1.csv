"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair - I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that time pressure affects me more heavily than you (20% vs 5% inflation).""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since the inflation rates affect me much more severely (20% vs 5%), and we still have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer as it doesn't adequately account for the time pressure I'm under."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to compensate for the rapidly decreasing value. This 65-35 split is fair considering these dynamics. Let's agree and end this now before further inflation impacts us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation impact, especially on your side, I'm willing to slightly increase my share, but still offer a considerable amount to you. Let's settle before further losses. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the inflation is starting to severely impact my potential gains. While the split isn't ideal, waiting longer would mean even greater losses due to my higher inflation rate (20% per round). With the current 48.8% inflation on my side, this $42 is worth more than a larger nominal amount in future rounds."
