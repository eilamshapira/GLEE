Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to compensate for the rapidly decreasing value. This 65-35 split is fair considering these dynamics. Let's agree and end this now before further inflation impacts us both. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
