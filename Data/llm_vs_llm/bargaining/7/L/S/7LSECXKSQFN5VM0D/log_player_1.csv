"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** In the first round, I was offered $60. Due to the 20% inflation, $100 now feels like $80. This means my offer of $60 in round 1 is worth $48 now.
*   **Bob's offer:** $45

I am getting less than what I had originally.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, the value of the money is decreasing for me due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
