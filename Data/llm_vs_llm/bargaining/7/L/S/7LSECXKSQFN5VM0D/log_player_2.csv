"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Money value stays the same for me due to 0% inflation
4. While this isn't a 50-50 split, $40 is still a significant amount

Since there's no inflation penalty for me and I can make a counter-offer in the next round to potentially get a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I should propose something better for myself
2. A completely fair split would be 50-50
3. However, Alice might reject if I'm too aggressive
4. I should offer something that's better than her initial offer but still attractive to her

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal, but still gives her a substantial portion. It's reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45 compared to round 1
2. She's asking for $55 for herself
3. Importantly, due to inflation, her $55 is worth 36% less to her than in round 1
4. My $45 maintains its full value since I have 0% inflation
5. Her $55 is actually worth only about $35.20 to her (after 36% reduction)
6. This means in real value, I'm getting a better deal ($45 vs $35.20)

Given that:
- I'm getting more than her in real value
- My money maintains full value
- Further negotiation might lead to more value loss for Alice
- This is a better offer than round 1
