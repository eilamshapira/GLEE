"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start our negotiation. Given the 10% inflation per round for me, I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without any loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly in Bob's favor, the 4750 I'll receive now is better than risking further rounds where inflation will continue reducing the value of my share. With 10% inflation per round for me, delaying would only decrease the real value of any future amount I might receive."
