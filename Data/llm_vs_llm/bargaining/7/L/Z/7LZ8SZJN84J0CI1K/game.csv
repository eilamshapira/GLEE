590000.0,410000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting this split based on our different inflation rates. Since your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting. This is actually a fair split when accounting for present value calculations.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share at 20% per round compared to your 10%, I believe my proposal of 450000 for me and 550000 for you is fair. It's a better deal for me than your last offer, and still generous to you given our inflation rates. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
