"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 590000,
""bob_gain"": 410000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting this split based on our different inflation rates. Since your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting. This is actually a fair split when accounting for present value calculations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share at 20% per round compared to your 10%, I believe my proposal of 450000 for me and 550000 for you is fair. It's a better deal for me than your last offer, and still generous to you given our inflation rates. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
