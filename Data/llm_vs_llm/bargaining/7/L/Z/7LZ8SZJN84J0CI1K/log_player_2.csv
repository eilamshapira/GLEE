"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting this split based on our different inflation rates. Since your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting. This is actually a fair split when accounting for present value calculations. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of my share at 20% per round compared to your 10%, I believe my proposal of 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you is fair. It's a better deal for me than your last offer, and still generous to you given our inflation rates. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.""
