"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $30 while she gets $70. 

If I reject and propose in the next round, inflation will reduce the total value by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. After one round, the $100 would be worth $95 to me and only $80 to Alice.

Since Alice faces much higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. A more equitable split would be reasonable for both of us, especially considering the inflation asymmetry.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making an offer now, I need to consider both the fairness and the inflation pressures we both face. Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% per round) than I do (5% per round), which gives me some leverage.

However, I should still propose a reasonable offer that Alice would accept, because if she rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation.

Given that Alice just offered me $30, and considering our different inflation rates, I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I'm proposing that I receive $45 and Alice receives $55. This is a more equitable division than her initial offer, but still gives her a slight advantage. Since she faces higher inflation, accepting this offer now would be rational for her rather than delaying and losing more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. Alice has rejected my more balanced offer and is now proposing that I get even less than her initial offer - only $25 while she gets $75.

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth 9.75% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 36% less than round 1

This means Alice is facing significant inflation pressure, yet she's proposing an even more unbalanced split in her favor. This doesn't make strategic sense given her higher inflation rate.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4:
- My inflation will increase to about 14.75%
- Alice's inflation will increase to about 56%

Given the large inflation asymmetry and the fact that Alice is offering me less than before despite her rapidly decreasing value, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers our relative inflation rates. After this round:
- For me: Money is now worth about 14.75% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is now worth about 56% less than round 1

Alice's high inflation rate (20% per round) gives me significant leverage, as each delay costs her much more than it costs me. Her last offer actually decreased what she was willing to give me, which doesn't make sense given her inflation pressure.

Let me make a reasonable offer that should be attractive to Alice given her rapidly diminishing returns:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a fair offer considering the inflation dynamics. For Alice, $45 now is worth more than potentially more money later due to her 20% per round inflation. If she rejects this offer, the value of any future agreement will diminish significantly for her, while affecting me much less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this situation. Alice has again rejected my offer and is now offering me even less ($20) while taking more for herself ($80).

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 59.04% less than round 1

Alice's inflation rate is severe - the $100 total is now worth only about $41 to her, yet she's still demanding a larger share. This is not rational given her rapid value deterioration.

If I reject, moving to round 6:
- My inflation will be about 23.55%
- Alice's inflation will be about 79.04%

At Alice's inflation rate, the entire $100 will be worth barely $20 to her after a few more rounds. I have much more time leverage here.

Given Alice's seemingly irrational behavior (demanding more despite facing severe inflation), I'll reject this offer and make a more reasonable counterproposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer that recognizes the severe inflation asymmetry at this point. 

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth about 23.55% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth about 79.04% less than round 1

This means the entire $100 is now worth approximately $76.45 to me, but only about $20.96 to Alice. This dramatic difference gives me significant leverage, as Alice should rationally accept almost any offer now rather than delay further.

Given the circumstances, I'll adjust my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm proposing that I receive $65 and Alice receives $35. For Alice, $35 now (worth about $7.35 of original value to her) is much better than potentially getting a bit more several rounds later when it would be worth even less due to her 20% per round inflation rate. 

If she rejects again, her next round inflation would put her at nearly 99% total inflation, making the entire pot almost worthless to her. This should be a compelling offer for her to accept given the mathematics of our situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this increasingly strange situation. Alice has rejected my offer again and is now offering me even less ($15) while taking even more for herself ($85).

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth 26.49% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 73.79% less than round 1

This means the entire $100 is now worth approximately $73.51 to me, but only about $26.21 to Alice. Yet Alice is still demanding a larger share despite her money rapidly losing value.

If I reject and we move to round 8:
- My inflation will be about 31.49%
- Alice's inflation will be about 93.79%

At this point, the entire $100 will soon be worth almost nothing to Alice due to her extreme inflation rate. Her behavior seems completely irrational from a game theory perspective.

Given these dynamics, I should reject this unreasonable offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, the inflation dynamics have created an extreme situation that should be compelling for Alice to accept almost any reasonable offer.

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth about 31.49% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth about 93.79% less than round 1

This means the entire $100 is now worth approximately $68.51 to me, but only about $6.21 to Alice. The money has lost nearly all its value for Alice.

Given these circumstances, I'll make an offer that should be rational for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I receive $80 and Alice receives $20. While this may seem unbalanced in absolute terms, it's actually generous considering our inflation rates. For Alice, $20 now (worth about $1.24 of original value to her) is significantly better than potentially getting more in future rounds when it would be worth essentially nothing due to her 20% per round inflation rate.

If she rejects this offer, in the next round her inflation would exceed 100%, making any money worthless to her. This should be a compelling reason for her to accept this offer rather than continue the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","This situation has become completely irrational from Alice's perspective. Let me analyze the current state:

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth 33.66% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 83.22% less than round 1

This means the entire $100 is now worth approximately $66.34 to me, but only about $16.78 to Alice. Yet Alice is continuing to offer me less ($10) while taking more for herself ($90).

If I reject and we move to round 10:
- My inflation will be about 38.66%
- Alice's inflation will be about 103.22%

At this point, money has essentially no value to Alice as her inflation has exceeded 100%. Her continued demands for more money make no game-theoretic sense when it's nearly worthless to her.

Since Alice's behavior seems to defy rational economic principles, I need to make my own rational decision. Taking $10 now (worth about $6.63 of original value to me) is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach agreement by round 12.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a truly extreme situation where the inflation has created a scenario that defies normal economic reasoning, particularly for Alice.

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth about 38.66% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth about 103.22% less than round 1

This means the entire $100 is now worth approximately $61.34 to me, but for Alice, the inflation has exceeded 100%, which mathematically means the money has negative value to her. This is an unusual situation that suggests some other factor may be driving Alice's behavior beyond economic rationality.

Given that we only have 2 more rounds after this before we both get nothing, and Alice's apparent insistence on getting a large nominal amount regardless of its actual value to her, I'll make one final reasonable offer:

{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}

I'm proposing that I receive $95 and Alice receives $5. While this heavily favors me in nominal terms, given Alice's inflation rate, any positive amount should be better than nothing for her at this point. The $5 still has some value to me, while for Alice, the entire $100 has essentially no value due to her inflation exceeding 100%.

If she rejects this offer, we're moving dangerously close to both of us getting nothing after round 12."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The situation has reached its final stages, and I need to make a practical decision.

Current inflation status:
- For me: Money is worth 40.13% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 89.26% less than round 1

This means $5 for me is worth approximately $2.99 of original value. While this is a very small amount, we only have one round left after this before both of us get nothing.

Alice has consistently rejected all my offers and continually reduced her offers to me. Given that we're at the penultimate round and facing the possibility of both getting nothing after round 12, I need to make a pragmatic choice.

While $5 is far from fair, getting something is better than nothing. If I reject now, we'll have only one more round to reach agreement before both receiving nothing.
