I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I have the first move and want to secure a large portion of the money.  This leaves room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer by 200,000, but still keeping a significant majority. I believe this is a fair counter-offer given the inflation and Bob's previous attempt to grab a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000
