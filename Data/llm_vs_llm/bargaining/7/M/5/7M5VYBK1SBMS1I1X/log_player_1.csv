"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm Alice and need to account for potential inflation if Bob refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer since my $45 is already worth only $40.50 due to 10% inflation, making it quite unfavorable for me. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share to account for the increasing inflation effect (now my gains are worth 20% less). This offer would effectively give me $52 in round 1 value, while Bob gets $35, which is still a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 27.1% inflation, my $40 would only be worth about $29.16 in round 1 value, while Bob gets the full $60. That's too unfavorable for me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Since my gains are now worth 34.4% less due to inflation, I need to increase my share to get a fair value. With this 70-30 split, I would effectively receive about $46 in round 1 value, while Bob gets $30. This is still reasonable considering we both started by asking for 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 40.95% inflation, my $35 would only be worth about $20.67 in round 1 value, while Bob gets the full $65. This is extremely unfavorable for me. Given that we're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds, I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

With my gains now worth 46.86% less due to inflation, I need a larger share to maintain a reasonable value. Even with this 75-25 split, I would effectively receive only about $39.86 in round 1 value (75 * 0.5314), while Bob gets $25. Bob needs to realize that as rounds progress, higher nominal amounts for me are necessary just to maintain the same real value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 52.17% inflation, my $30 would only be worth about $14.35 in round 1 value, while Bob gets the full $70. This is getting worse with each round. We only have 4 rounds left, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. I'll make a more moderate proposal in the next round to try to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

With my gains now worth 57% less due to inflation, I need to propose this 80-20 split. Even with $80, I would effectively receive only about $34.40 in round 1 value (80 * 0.43), while Bob gets $20. We're running out of time with only 3 rounds left after this, and we both risk getting nothing. This offer gives us both a meaningful amount rather than risking zero for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. Even though with 61.26% inflation my $45 would only be worth about $17.43 in round 1 value, we only have 2 rounds left after this. The risk of getting nothing is too high, and Bob has finally made a more reasonable offer compared to his previous ones. While not ideal, it's better to secure some value rather than risk walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the final rounds."
