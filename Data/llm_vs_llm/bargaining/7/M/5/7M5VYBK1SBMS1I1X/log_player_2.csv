"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. Since money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but loses 10% value for Alice each round, I have some leverage. If we go to the next round, $60 would only be worth $54 to Alice, while my $40 would still be worth $40.

I could make a counter-offer in the next round that gives me more while still being attractive to Alice given the depreciation she faces. I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I can offer her slightly less than her initial offer while still making it attractive to her due to the time pressure. If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth even less to her.

Her $60 from round 1 is now worth $54 to her. I'll offer a split that gives me more while still being reasonable enough that she should accept to avoid further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is fair because:
1. The $45 now is worth more to her than a higher amount in future rounds
2. I'm taking a reasonable increase from her initial offer
3. It leaves her with a significant portion while improving my position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a poor offer from Alice. Let me analyze:

1. She's actually offering me less ($35) than her first offer ($40)
2. Her $65 is only worth about $52.65 to her due to the 19% depreciation
3. I don't face any depreciation, so my purchasing power remains constant
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and each round makes her position weaker

This offer is worse for me than her initial offer, which I already rejected. Given that time pressure affects only her and not me, I should reject this and make a better counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has depreciated by 27.1% (1 - 0.9^3). She needs to consider that if she rejects this offer, her money will be worth even less next round. I should make an offer that takes advantage of this situation while still being attractive enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The $40 for Alice now is worth about $29.16 to her due to inflation
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. We're already 1/3 through the available rounds
4. She needs to start considering accepting soon to avoid getting nothing if we reach round 12
5. This is still better for her than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an even worse offer than before. Let me analyze:

1. Alice is now offering me only $30, which is less than all her previous offers
2. Her $70 is only worth about $45.93 to her (due to 34.39% depreciation)
3. I still face no depreciation
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Her negotiating position is getting weaker with each round due to increasing depreciation

Alice seems to be playing aggressively despite her weakening position. She should be offering me more, not less, as time goes on because her money is worth less to her with each round. This offer is not rational given the circumstances.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alice seems to be playing aggressively, but her position continues to weaken. At this point, her money has depreciated by about 41% (1 - 0.9^5). We're halfway through the rounds, and she needs to seriously consider accepting to avoid getting nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The $35 for Alice now is worth only about $20.65 to her due to inflation
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. We're now halfway through the available rounds
4. The threat of getting nothing if we reach round 12 is becoming more real
5. Even though this offer might seem aggressive, it's actually rational given:
   - Her severe depreciation
   - The limited remaining rounds
   - My unchanged purchasing power
   - The risk of both getting nothing if we don't agree

I'm increasing my demand because the time pressure is mounting on her side, not mine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an increasingly irrational offer from Alice. Let's analyze:

1. She's now offering me just $25, her lowest offer yet
2. Her $75 is only worth about $39.86 to her (due to 46.86% depreciation)
3. I still face no depreciation
4. We only have 5 rounds left
5. She's still playing aggressively despite her rapidly weakening position

This offer makes no sense because:
- She's offering me less while her own money is worth less to her
- We're getting dangerously close to the 12-round limit
- If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing
- Her $75 is worth less to her now than $40 was in round 1

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a critical phase. After 7 rounds, Alice's money has depreciated by about 52% (1 - 0.9^7), and we only have 4 rounds left after this one. Her continued aggressive play despite her weakening position suggests she might not be fully rational, but I need to make an offer that strongly incentivizes her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The $30 for Alice now is worth only about $14.4 to her due to inflation
2. We only have 4 rounds left after this one
3. The risk of both getting nothing is becoming very real
4. Even though I'm asking for more than before, this is still better for her than:
   - Getting nothing if we reach round 12
   - Waiting for future rounds where her money will be worth even less
5. She needs to start being realistic about her deteriorating position

If she rejects this, I might need to adjust my strategy in the final rounds to ensure we reach an agreement before round 12."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's behavior is becoming concerning. Let's analyze:

1. She's now offering me just $20, continuing her pattern of decreasing offers
2. Her $80 is only worth about $34.44 to her (due to 56.95% depreciation)
3. We only have 3 rounds left after this one
4. We're dangerously close to both getting nothing
5. Her offers are getting more extreme despite her rapidly weakening position

This is a very poor offer because:
- It's her lowest offer yet
- We're very close to the deadline
- Her $80 is worth less to her now than $40 was in round 1
- The risk of mutual zero payoff is becoming extremely high

However, given her pattern of behavior and the approaching deadline, I need to carefully consider my next move. She seems committed to an aggressive strategy despite it being against her interests.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a critical situation with only 2 rounds remaining after this one. Given Alice's pattern of increasingly aggressive offers despite her severe depreciation (about 61% by now), I need to adjust my strategy to ensure we don't both end up with nothing. While I could continue escalating my demands, that might lead to mutual destruction.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I'm actually decreasing my demand from 70 to 55, showing willingness to compromise
2. Even with depreciation, $45 now is better for Alice than risking zero
3. We only have 2 rounds left after this one
4. This is a serious attempt to break the deadlock
5. It's close to my initial counter-offer from round 2, which might help Alice save face

I'm making this more moderate offer because:
- The risk of mutual zero payoff is now very high
- Alice has shown she's willing to risk everything rather than accept a disadvantageous offer
- Getting $55 is better than risking getting nothing
- This offer gives us a realistic chance of reaching agreement before round 12"
