"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is my first offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still offers Bob a significant amount. Given the rapid deflation for Bob (20% per round), a large initial offer might be attractive to him. I'm hoping he'll accept this, avoiding further deflation and maximizing our collective gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the updated values due to inflation. Let's analyze:

*   **My perspective:** My initial worth was based on $10,000. Now my worth is based on $9,000, so I want at least 5400$.
*   **Bob's perspective:** His initial worth was based on $10,000. Now his worth is based on $8,000.

Bob is offering me $6200, which is significantly more than what I feel is fair for me. Even after the 10% deflation, I would be getting 6200$.
