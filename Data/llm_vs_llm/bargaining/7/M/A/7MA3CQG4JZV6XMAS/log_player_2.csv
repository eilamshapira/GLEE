"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
2. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth 5% less in the next round
3. If I reject, my 4000$ would effectively become worth 3800$ in the next round

Given that:
- I'm guaranteed 4000$ if I accept now
- Any delay will reduce my purchasing power
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me in the next round
- The difference between 50-50 and 60-40 (1000$) is not worth the risk of losing value through inflation
