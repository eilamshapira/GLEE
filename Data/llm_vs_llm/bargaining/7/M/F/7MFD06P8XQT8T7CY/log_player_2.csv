"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So waiting comes at a cost. On the other hand, I might be able to get more than 50%.

Since this is the first round and there are 12 rounds total, I have room to negotiate for a better deal. The inflation penalty means I shouldn't wait too long, but I think I can afford to make at least one counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still reasonable. Given the inflation risk for me and the fact that Alice can still reject and counter, I'll aim for a moderate advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has increased my share from her initial 50-50 split to $550,000, while taking $450,000 for herself.

Due to inflation, the $550,000 is now worth about 9.75% less to me than in round 1, which means its effective value to me is around $496,375. This is slightly less than the $500,000 from the initial offer.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation will increase to approximately 14.75%, further reducing the value of any amount I might receive. While I could ask for more, the declining value due to inflation makes waiting risky.

Since Alice has moved in my direction and the effective value is close to the original 50-50 split, and further delays will only reduce my purchasing power more, I'll accept this offer.
