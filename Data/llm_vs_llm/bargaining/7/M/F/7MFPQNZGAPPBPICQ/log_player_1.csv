"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and Bob can always counter.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the 10% inflation loss by going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob's offer would give me $4,500, which due to 10% inflation is actually worth $4,050.
If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount would be worth another 10% less.

While this offer is less than what I proposed initially, accepting now would be better than continuing and losing more value to inflation. If I reject, we both lose more money overall.
