"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and mine doesn't depreciate, I have an advantage by waiting. If Alice gets 50$ next round, it will only be worth 40$ to her, while my share maintains its value.

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer in the next round, taking advantage of the asymmetric inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money depreciates by 20% each round, and she just saw her 50-50 offer rejected, I can propose a deal that gives me a bit more while still being acceptable to her. If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair offer considering the depreciation factor. It's better for Alice to accept 40$ now than to risk getting less value in future rounds due to the 20% inflation on her side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Alice has offered me 60$ (which maintains its full value for me) and keeps 40$ (which is actually worth only 25.6$ to her due to the 36% depreciation).

While I could potentially get more by rejecting and waiting (since Alice's value will depreciate further), there are a few reasons to accept:
1. This is actually a good deal for me - I get 60% of the total
2. There's always the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
3. The offer matches what I just proposed, showing we're converging on an agreement
