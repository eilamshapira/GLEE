""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With inflation reducing our money's value each round, it's in both our interests to reach agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $450,000 while acknowledging my position as the initial proposer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation, it's crucial we reach an agreement swiftly. A fair 50-50 split ensures both our interests are equally valued. Let's settle on this to maximize our gains before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
