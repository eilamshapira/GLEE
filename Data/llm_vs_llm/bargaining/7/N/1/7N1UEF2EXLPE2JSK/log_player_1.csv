"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to think strategically here. Given the inflation rates, I should propose a division that considers our different discount factors. I should offer a deal that's better for me but still attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the fact that waiting is more costly for him (20% discount per round) than for me (5% discount).

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while keeping the majority for myself."
