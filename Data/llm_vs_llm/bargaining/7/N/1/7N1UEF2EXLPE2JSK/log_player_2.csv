"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 20% less next round
   - Alice's money will only be worth 5% less next round
4. My $400,000 now is better than a potentially larger amount that will be worth much less due to the high inflation rate affecting me

While I could try to negotiate for more, the asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations. The offer, while not equal, is substantial enough that the risk of waiting isn't worth it.
