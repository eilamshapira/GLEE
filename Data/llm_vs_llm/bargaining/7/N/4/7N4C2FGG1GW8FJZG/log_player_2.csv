"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the amount 50/50. It's fair and ensures both of us benefit equally from the total. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's 50/50 split offer. While it appears fair at first glance, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty for each round I delay. If I reject now and make a counteroffer, the total value to me decreases to 800,000$ next round.

Given the inflation effect, accepting a guaranteed $500,000 now is likely better than risking a potentially better deal later when the money will be worth less to me.
