200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I receive $200000 and you receive $800000. Since waiting beyond round 1 will subject your share to a 20% devaluation while mine remains unaffected, this offer gives you the same effective value you could secure in round 2 if you were to propose – but without any delay risk. Let’s agree now and avoid unnecessary complications.",Alice,1,
