"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I receive $200000 and you receive $800000. Since waiting beyond round 1 will subject your share to a 20% devaluation while mine remains unaffected, this offer gives you the same effective value you could secure in round 2 if you were to propose – but without any delay risk. Let’s agree now and avoid unnecessary complications. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
