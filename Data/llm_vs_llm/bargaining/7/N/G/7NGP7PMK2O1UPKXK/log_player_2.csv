"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, since I have a higher inflation rate (10% vs Alice's 5%), waiting will hurt me more than it hurts Alice. 

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- My 5000 would be worth 4500 (10% less)
- Alice's 5000 would be worth 4750 (5% less)

While I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal due to my higher inflation rate, the risk of further rounds reducing the value isn't worth it for a fair initial offer.
