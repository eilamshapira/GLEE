Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that I think is fair and gives both of us a good share of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
