0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob – I know that waiting only hurts my share, while your money never loses its value. To avoid unnecessary delays (and my declining position), I’m offering you the full $10000 right now. Since by waiting you’d still expect the full amount in later rounds, I hope you’ll accept this proposal immediately so we can settle without delay.",Alice,1,
