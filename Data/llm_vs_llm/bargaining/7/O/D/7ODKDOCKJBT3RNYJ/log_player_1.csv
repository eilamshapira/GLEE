"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split $100 with me taking $60 and you getting $40. This way, we both quickly get a fair share without losing value to inflation in the next rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's divide it fairly, but keep in mind the value decreases for you more significantly in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
