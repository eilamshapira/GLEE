"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to be fair while accounting for the inflation that affects me. Let me propose a reasonable split:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is a fair and equal division that respects both our interests. Since I face 5% inflation each round, I'd prefer we reach an agreement quickly, but I believe starting with an even split is the most reasonable approach."
