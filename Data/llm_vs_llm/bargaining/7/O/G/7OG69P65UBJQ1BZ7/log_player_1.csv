"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation hits you harder, I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $36
* If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  - The money will be worth even less (40% less than round 1 for me)
  - Bob faces only 5% inflation per round, so he has less pressure to accept
  - My bargaining position weakens significantly with each round

Given that Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation difference and offers a reasonable split, and considering that waiting would significantly reduce my effective gains, I should accept this offer.
