"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of inflation. If we continue, the value of the money will decrease, and we might end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
