Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split, acknowledging that I'm proposing first.  A little extra for me to account for the proposer's advantage seems reasonable. Let's agree now to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally.
