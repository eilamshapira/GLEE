"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 20% less to me next round (so $5000 would become worth $4000 to me)
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she might or might not be under similar pressure

Given that:
- The offer is fair
- Rejecting would definitely cost me 20% value
- There's no guarantee I could get a better deal next round
- Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further losses
