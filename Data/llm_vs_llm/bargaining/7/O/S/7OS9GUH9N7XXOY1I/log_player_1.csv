"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the 12‐round alternating-offers game—with the understanding that each round’s delay reduces the “real” value of the money by 20% for you (Alice) and 10% for Bob—the equilibrium division (in nominal dollars) turns out to favor Bob because he is less “impatient” than you. (In a dynamic bargaining setup the proposer’s “advantage” is offset when your discount factor is lower; here your money loses 20% per round while Bob’s loses only 10%.) 

A brief sketch of the reasoning:
1. In round 12 the proposer can claim nearly all of $100 (offering only a negligible amount to the other, who would then get nothing if the offer were refused).
2. Working backward, in round 11 (with you proposing) you must offer Bob at least what he would secure as proposer in round 12—after accounting for his 10% discount for one extra round.
3. Continuing this way through rounds 10, 9, …, and then back to round 1, we find that in equilibrium the “threat point” for Bob (if he rejects in round 1) is about $69.26 in nominal terms.
4. That means that to make Bob just indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in round 2, your round‑1 offer must give him at least about $69.26—and you’d then keep about $30.74.

Thus, as Alice in round 1 your equilibrium offer is approximately:

{""alice_gain"": 30.74, ""bob_gain"": 69.26}
