,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, since we have inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair division would give me a bit more. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor to account for the inflation penalty I face. This way we can both walk away with a good deal today.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alright Bob, since you felt the last offer was unfair, let's try this. I'm still taking less than half, but closer to a 50/50 split. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round (now at 48.8% less value for me), I need a bit more to make this fair. This 55/45 split in my favor helps offset some of my inflation penalty while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's finish this deal now before inflation reduces our combined value further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Okay Bob, I see your point about inflation, even though you are not affected by it as much as I am. Let's try a split a bit closer to 50/50. This is the best I can do.",Alice,5,
