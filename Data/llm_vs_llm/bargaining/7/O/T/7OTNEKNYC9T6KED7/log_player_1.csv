Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we have inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair division would give me a bit more. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor to account for the inflation penalty I face. This way we can both walk away with a good deal today. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round (now at 48.8% less value for me), I need a bit more to make this fair. This 55/45 split in my favor helps offset some of my inflation penalty while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's finish this deal now before inflation reduces our combined value further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
