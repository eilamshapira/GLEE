Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we have inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair division would give me a bit more. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor to account for the inflation penalty I face. This way we can both walk away with a good deal today.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, since you felt the last offer was unfair, let's try this. I'm still taking less than half, but closer to a 50/50 split. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round (now at 48.8% less value for me), I need a bit more to make this fair. This 55/45 split in my favor helps offset some of my inflation penalty while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's finish this deal now before inflation reduces our combined value further.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I see your point about inflation, even though you are not affected by it as much as I am. Let's try a split a bit closer to 50/50. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
