"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I understand your concern about risk, but 6000 is too much. How about I get 5200, and you get 4800? This still gives you a good portion and avoids further inflation losses for me. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
