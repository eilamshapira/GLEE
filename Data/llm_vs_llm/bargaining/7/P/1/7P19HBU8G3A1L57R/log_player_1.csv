"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob, but I'm willing to gamble that it's hurting him more than he's letting on.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm raising my demand slightly, hoping Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I could potentially get in future rounds with inflation eating away at the value.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse one later."
