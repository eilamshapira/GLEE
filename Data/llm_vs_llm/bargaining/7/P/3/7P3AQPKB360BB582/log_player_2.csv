"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, which is a substantial amount, I think we should aim for a more balanced division. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that gives us both a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, giving us each $5,000. This creates an equal outcome that respects both of our interests."
