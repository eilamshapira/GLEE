"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly. It seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer to split the money evenly.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is $50 for each of us. This is a perfectly fair division that gives us equal shares. Since we're in the first round and this offer is fair, I'll accept it.
