"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the decreasing value for you, I believe this is a fair offer considering we're in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money for me, I should act quickly to get a decent share. However, Bob's offer seems a bit biased towards himself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already Round 3, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still considering my own interests. The total value for me is now 10,000 * (0.9)^2 = 8100.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""message"": ""Time is money, let's settle this""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid decrease in value for you, this offer is more generous than before. Let's end this soon. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. However, his offer is the same as mine in Round 3, which he rejected. Considering the inflation, the value for me is now 10,000 * (0.9)^3 = 7290.

Given that Bob's offer is not more generous than before, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses.
