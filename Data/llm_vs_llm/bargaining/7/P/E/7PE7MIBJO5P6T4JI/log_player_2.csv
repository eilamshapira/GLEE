"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you lose more value in later rounds due to higher inflation on your side. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself, justifying this with the fact that I face higher inflation (20% per round) compared to her (5% per round).

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to consider this devaluation.

While I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer next round, the substantial inflation rate for me creates significant pressure to accept sooner rather than later.

Given the significant inflation difference and the fact that I'd lose substantial value by continuing to the next round, this isn't a terrible offer.
