"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, the total value decreases by 5% for me in the next round, meaning we'd be dividing $95 from my perspective.

If I make a counter-offer, I could potentially get more than $40, but I risk Alice rejecting and the money losing more value. Even if I propose a 50-50 split in the next round ($47.50 each), that's only $7.50 more than I'm being offered now, and it's not guaranteed Alice will accept.

Given the inflation risk, I'll accept this first offer.
