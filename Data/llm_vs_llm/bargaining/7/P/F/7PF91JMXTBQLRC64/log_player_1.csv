"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the asymmetric inflation rates. Since I (Alice) face a higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a favorable first-round deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split, which gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, we'll both lose value, with me losing more than him due to higher inflation. This split gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging the time pressure we face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $400,000 is worth only 80% of first-round value = $320,000 equivalent
   * Bob's $600,000 is worth 95% of first-round value = $570,000 equivalent

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 60% of original value
   * Bob's money will be worth 90% of original value
   * This significantly weakens my negotiating position

While this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, the high inflation rate affecting me (20%) makes it risky to continue negotiating. If I reject, any future gains will be significantly devalued for me, while Bob's losses to inflation are much smaller.
