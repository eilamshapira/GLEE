I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This seems fair to me, as I'm the one who proposed this game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
