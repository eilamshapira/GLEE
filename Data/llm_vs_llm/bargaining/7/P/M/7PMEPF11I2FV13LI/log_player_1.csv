"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first offer in this negotiation game, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I should try to secure a good deal early due to the inflation penalty I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see Bob is pushing for a 60-40 split in his favor, but I need to consider the increasing inflation penalty on my end. At this point, the money is worth 40% less for me than in round 1, while Bob's inflation is only 10% per round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more accommodating given the inflation pressure I'm facing. With this 55-45 split, I'm proposing a more balanced division that still gives me a slight advantage while offering Bob a better deal than my initial proposal."
