60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's start with a generous offer for me. This ensures we both get a good amount, especially considering inflation will hurt me later on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, since every subsequent round costs you 20% of your money’s value, I’m offering you $30 now to secure a better outcome than what waiting might yield. Accepting this proposal avoids further loss on your side and lets us conclude the deal quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy. However, my money hasn't devalued *that* much yet. Let's be more reasonable. I'm offering 55 for me, 45 for you. A good compromise for both!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5.0,95.0,"Alice, by moving to round 5 your money's value drops further—to only about 41% of its initial worth. Even though you'll be the proposer then, my position remains strong as my share isn’t discounted at all. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a guaranteed $5 (worth roughly $2.56 in round 4 value) rather than risking an even lower effective payoff. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both going to walk away with nothing if we keep this up. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses due to my rapidly declining value. Accept and let's move on.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3.0,97.0,"Alice, by accepting this offer in round 6, you'll secure $3 at today's value—even though once discounted it's around $0.98 for you. If we postpone to round 7, your share would be devalued further to roughly 26% of its face value, leaving you even worse off. I believe this offer is more attractive considering the rapid discounting you face. Please accept this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
