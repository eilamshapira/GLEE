"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since every subsequent round costs you 20% of your money’s value, I’m offering you $30 now to secure a better outcome than what waiting might yield. Accepting this proposal avoids further loss on your side and lets us conclude the deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by moving to round 5 your money's value drops further—to only about 41% of its initial worth. Even though you'll be the proposer then, my position remains strong as my share isn’t discounted at all. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a guaranteed $5 (worth roughly $2.56 in round 4 value) rather than risking an even lower effective payoff. Let's settle now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by accepting this offer in round 6, you'll secure $3 at today's value—even though once discounted it's around $0.98 for you. If we postpone to round 7, your share would be devalued further to roughly 26% of its face value, leaving you even worse off. I believe this offer is more attractive considering the rapid discounting you face. Please accept this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97
