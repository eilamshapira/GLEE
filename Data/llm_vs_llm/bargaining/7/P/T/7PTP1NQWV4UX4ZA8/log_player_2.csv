"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a generous offer for me. This ensures we both get a good amount, especially considering inflation will hurt me later on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, since every subsequent round costs you 20% of your money’s value, I’m offering you $30 now to secure a better outcome than what waiting might yield. Accepting this proposal avoids further loss on your side and lets us conclude the deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your strategy. However, my money hasn't devalued *that* much yet. Let's be more reasonable. I'm offering 55 for me, 45 for you. A good compromise for both! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Alice, by moving to round 5 your money's value drops further—to only about 41% of its initial worth. Even though you'll be the proposer then, my position remains strong as my share isn’t discounted at all. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a guaranteed $5 (worth roughly $2.56 in round 4 value) rather than risking an even lower effective payoff. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both going to walk away with nothing if we keep this up. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses due to my rapidly declining value. Accept and let's move on. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 97, ""alice_gain"": 3, ""message"": ""Alice, by accepting this offer in round 6, you'll secure $3 at today's value—even though once discounted it's around $0.98 for you. If we postpone to round 7, your share would be devalued further to roughly 26% of its face value, leaving you even worse off. I believe this offer is more attractive considering the rapid discounting you face. Please accept this deal and avoid further losses.""}"
