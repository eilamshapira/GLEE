"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $350,000 (35%) while keeping $650,000 (65%) for herself
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me
4. While it's a substantial amount, I can likely negotiate for a better deal

Since there's no downside for me to continue negotiating (no inflation penalty), and I can potentially get a better deal, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have some negotiating leverage:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal, giving me 55% and Alice 45%. It's fair enough that it might be accepted, but still advantageous to me. Since I know I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my negotiation while still remaining reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself
2. However, due to inflation, Alice's share is actually worth 36% less to her, so her $550,000 is effectively worth only $352,000 to her
3. My share remains at full value ($450,000)
4. This is a better offer than her first one ($450,000 vs $350,000 for me)
5. If I reject, we continue negotiating, and inflation will affect Alice even more

Given that:
- I'm getting a decent share ($450,000)
- Alice is already suffering from significant inflation
- This is a substantial improvement from the first offer
- Further negotiations might make Alice less likely to accept any deal due to time pressure

I'll accept this offer. It's a good deal for me, and pushing further might risk the negotiation breaking down.
