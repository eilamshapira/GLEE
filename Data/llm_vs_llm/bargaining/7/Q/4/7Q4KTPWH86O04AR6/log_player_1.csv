"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for the division of $100.

Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the $100, which gives each of us an equal share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer for the division of $100.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering a slightly adjusted split that gives Bob a bit more than half while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. This seems reasonable given our negotiation so far."
