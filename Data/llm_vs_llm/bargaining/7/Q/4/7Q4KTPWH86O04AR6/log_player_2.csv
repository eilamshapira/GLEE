"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better next round. Besides, with inflation, that $50 will be worth less in the next round, so it might be wise to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Considering inflation, I want to secure a bit more this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the money is worth slightly less due to inflation, accepting this offer ensures I get a fair amount. If I reject it, the value will only continue to decrease in future rounds."
