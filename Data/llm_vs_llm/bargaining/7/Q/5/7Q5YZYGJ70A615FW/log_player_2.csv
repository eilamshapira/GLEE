"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 40/60 split where I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000.

Given the inflation conditions, the money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but it loses 5% value per round for Alice. This gives me an advantage in later rounds, as Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

Since this is just the first round and I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. Given that Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I face no inflation, I have a strategic advantage. However, I still want to make a reasonable offer that Alice is likely to accept.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but is still fair enough that she should consider accepting it rather than facing further inflation.
