6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of the $10000 where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Since the money's value decreases by 5% for me with every subsequent round, settling early benefits both of us by avoiding any further erosion of value on my side. I believe this fair proposal gives you a solid gain while addressing the time sensitivity of our agreement. Letâ€™s secure a deal now to maximize our benefits.",Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, your opening offer was a bit imbalanced.  I'm proposing a 5250/4750 split. This reflects a fairer share considering the time value of money.  Let's wrap this up and both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for the offer. Given that any delay further would reduce my share's value by an additional 5%, I believe it's in both our interests to settle now. I accept your proposal of a 4750/5250 split.",Alice,2,accept
