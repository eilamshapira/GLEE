"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of the $10,000 where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Since the money's value decreases by 5% for me with every subsequent round, settling early benefits both of us by avoiding any further erosion of value on my side. I believe this fair proposal gives you a solid gain while addressing the time sensitivity of our agreement. Letâ€™s secure a deal now to maximize our benefits.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your opening offer was a bit imbalanced.  I'm proposing a 5250/4750 split. This reflects a fairer share considering the time value of money.  Let's wrap this up and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. Given that any delay further would reduce my share's value by an additional 5%, I believe it's in both our interests to settle now. I accept your proposal of a 4750/5250 split.""}"
