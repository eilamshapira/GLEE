"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of the $10000 where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Since the money's value decreases by 5% for me with every subsequent round, settling early benefits both of us by avoiding any further erosion of value on my side. I believe this fair proposal gives you a solid gain while addressing the time sensitivity of our agreement. Letâ€™s secure a deal now to maximize our benefits. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

This reflects a fairer share considering the time value of money.  Let's wrap this up and both benefit.""}"
