I propose a 950,000 / 50,000 split in my favor. It's a generous offer, considering Bob gets a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to let him walk away with the majority of the money. This split seems fair, considering the inflation factor."
