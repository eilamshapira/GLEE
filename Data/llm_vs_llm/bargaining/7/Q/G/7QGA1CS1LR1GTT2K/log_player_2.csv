"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 6000 and you get 4000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $4000, keeping $6000 for herself. This isn't an equal split. Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. Her $6000 would be worth only $5400 to her next round, while my money maintains its value.

I should reject this uneven split and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I'll propose a more balanced split while explaining the logic.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, considering you face 10% depreciation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your share will be worth less next round. Let's make a deal now that benefits both of us.""}"
