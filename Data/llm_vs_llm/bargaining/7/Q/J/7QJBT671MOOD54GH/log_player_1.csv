"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5128, ""bob_gain"": 4872, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split considering the time discount: I'll receive $5128 and you get $4872 of the $10,000. Accepting now preserves value for both of us—let’s settle quickly so we don’t lose out to the inflation penalty.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of losing money to inflation with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob. I recognize the time pressure caused by inflation, and splitting the available funds evenly at this stage is a fair solution that minimizes losses for both of us. I'm happy to accept your proposal of $5,000 each.""}"
