Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split considering the time discount: I'll receive $5128 and you get $4872 of the $10000. Accepting now preserves value for both of us—let’s settle quickly so we don’t lose out to the inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128
