"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide this equally. Each of us gets $5000. Fair and square. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering an equal split of $5,000 each, which seems fair at face value. However, I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. This means in the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. So the maximum I could get in the next round would be $8,000 in value.

Given that I'm being offered $5,000 now, and there's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, this is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject, I would need to secure more than $6,250 in the next round just to match the current value of $5,000 (because $6,250 with 20% inflation equals $5,000).
