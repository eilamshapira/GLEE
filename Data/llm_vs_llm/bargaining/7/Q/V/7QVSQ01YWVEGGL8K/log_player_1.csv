"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. My money is now worth less due to inflation.

Let's calculate: My original offer gave me $6000. Now, with 10% inflation, that's equivalent to $6000 * 0.9 = $5400 in terms of purchasing power.

Bob's offer is: Alice gets $4500, Bob gets $5500.

Considering the inflation, I need to make a decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a slightly better deal than Bob offered in the previous round. I know that I'm losing value each round, so I want to secure as much as possible.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. The inflation is now significant. The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. My initial $6000 offer is now equivalent to $6000 * (1 - 0.271) = $4374.

Bob's offer: Alice gets $5000, Bob gets $5000.

Based on my calculations, $5000 now is better than what I would have had in the first round in terms of purchasing power.
