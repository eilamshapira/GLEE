"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total amount ($4000)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
   - She might reject my counter-offer

While $4000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. Rejecting would mean I'm gambling on getting more in future rounds, but with guaranteed depreciation of 10% per round.

I think I should negotiate for a better deal, as we have several rounds left and the first offer is often not the best one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair but strategic offer:

Due to 10% inflation, $10,000 is now worth $9,000 to me. I should propose a division that takes this into account while being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor to compensate for inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a reasonable offer because:
1. It's closer to a 50-50 split than Alice's initial offer
2. Even with 10% inflation, I would get $4,950 in value
3. It's not too greedy, giving Alice a substantial portion
4. It shows I'm willing to be more fair than her initial offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With 19% inflation, if I accept $4200, it's actually worth $3402 to me (4200 * 0.81)
2. This is less valuable to me than her first offer would have been ($4000 with no inflation)
3. She only increased my share by $200 compared to her first offer, which doesn't compensate for the inflation loss
4. However, if I reject, the next round will have 29% inflation for me, making any future gains worth even less
5. I still have 9 rounds left, but the value is decreasing quickly

Since this offer is actually worse for me than her first offer (in real value), and I still have several rounds to negotiate:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe we can reach a better agreement before the inflation becomes too severe."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me strategize:

1. We're in round 4, so my gains are subject to 29% inflation (meaning $10,000 is worth $7,100 to me)
2. Alice has shown she's willing to give me around 40-42% in her offers
3. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept, while securing a better real value for myself
4. Previous balanced offer of 55-45 was rejected

I'll make a slightly more attractive offer to Alice while still improving my position:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly equal split, which:
1. Is more favorable to Alice than my previous offer
2. Is fair and hard to argue against
3. Still gives me $3,550 in real value after 29% inflation
4. Shows I'm reasonable and willing to compromise
5. Might appeal to Alice's sense of fairness"
