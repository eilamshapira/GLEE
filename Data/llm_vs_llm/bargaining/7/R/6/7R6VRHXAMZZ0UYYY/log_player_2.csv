"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This seems fair considering the effort and time we've put into this game. Let me know what you think!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is a fair way to go. This way, we both walk away with an equal share of the prize. I hope you agree with this equitable proposal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for fairness, but considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and it accounts for the diminishing value of the money for me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
