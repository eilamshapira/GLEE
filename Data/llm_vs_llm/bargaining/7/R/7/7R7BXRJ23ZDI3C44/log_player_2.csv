"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * Alice's value of money will decrease by 10%
   * My value stays the same
3. This means in the next round, $5000 will only be worth $4500 to Alice

With this in mind, I can likely get a better deal in the next round since Alice will be more willing to accept a lower amount due to the 10% depreciation. I should reject this offer and propose a split more in my favor next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money value decreases by 10% each round, and we're now in round 2, any amount I offer her is worth 10% less to her than in round 1. This means I can offer her slightly less than $5000, and it might still be rational for her to accept.

If she rejects, we'll go to round 3, where her money will be worth another 10% less. This gives me some leverage, but I shouldn't be too aggressive as we both lose everything if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Alice $4000, which is worth $3600 to her due to the 10% depreciation. If she rejects and we continue to the next round, any amount will be worth even less to her, so this is a reasonable offer that she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5500 (worth full value to me)
2. She's taking $4500 (worth only 81% of its value to her, so about $3645 in her perspective)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * Her money will be worth 29% less
   * I might get a better deal, but we're also using up rounds
   * We only have 9 rounds left after this

This is actually a pretty reasonable offer. She's already conceded more to my side compared to the initial 50-50 split, acknowledging the inflation effect. While I might be able to get slightly more by rejecting, there's also a risk of prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily. The offer is fair enough given the circumstances.
