"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we're both losing value with each round, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this time. Let's settle before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, and it hinges on reading Alice's strategy and risk tolerance. While a 45/55 split isn't ideal, it's better than what I was offered in round 1 considering inflation. However, Alice rejecting my previous offer suggests she might be aiming for a slightly larger share. By rejecting, I'm betting she'll get a bit more anxious as the rounds progress and potentially offer a better split in a later round."
