"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to balance our positions and considering the potential waiting cost (and any inflation uncertainties on your end), I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. This offer aims at an expedient settlement that preserves value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
