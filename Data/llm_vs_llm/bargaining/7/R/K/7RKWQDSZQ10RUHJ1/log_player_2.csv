"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round.
3. Due to inflation, the $500,000 would be worth only $400,000 to me next round.
4. There's also risk in rejection - Alice might make a worse offer next time.
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.

Given that:
- The offer is fair (50-50)
- Inflation will reduce my purchasing power if I wait
- There's risk in rejection
- This is the first round, so the money has full value
