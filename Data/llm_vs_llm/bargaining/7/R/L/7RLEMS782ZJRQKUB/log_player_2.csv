"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's split the amount in a way that gives me $600000 and you $400000. This way, we both get a significant share and can avoid potential decreases in value in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze this offer.

*   **My potential gain:** $400,000
*   **Alice's potential gain:** $600,000
*   **My discount rate per round:** 5%
*   **Alice's discount rate per round:** 20%

If I reject the offer, the money's value decreases for both of us, but more so for Alice. I need to decide if the potential gain from making an offer in the next round is worth the 5% loss in value. Let's consider a best-case scenario if I reject this offer, maybe Alice will offer 550000 to me.
My value = 550000 * 0.95 = 522500
Compared to accepting now: 400000
Worst case scenario, I get only 400000 next turn: 400000 * 0.95 = 380000.

Considering Alice loses 20% of her share, this is a very advantageous offer for her and not so advantageous for me. However, 400000 is still a very good amount. I will accept.
