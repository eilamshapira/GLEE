55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start promptly before inflation kicks in. I propose that I take $55 and you receive $45. I believe this is a fair split so we can both secure a decent share as time ticks. What do you think?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer in the first round. While I appreciate the sentiment, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation.  Let me know what you think!",Bob,2,

43.0,57.0,"Hi Bob, in this round the inflation penalty on your money is 20%, so while the nominal split is 43/57, your effective gain becomes about $45.6. I believe this offer is attractive compared to the risks and further losses if we delay. Let's strike a deal now for a fair division before any more devaluation sets in!",Alice,3,
