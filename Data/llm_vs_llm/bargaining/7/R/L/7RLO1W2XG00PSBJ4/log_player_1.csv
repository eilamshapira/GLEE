"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start promptly before inflation kicks in. I propose that I take $55 and you receive $45. I believe this is a fair split so we can both secure a decent share as time ticks. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer in the first round. While I appreciate the sentiment, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 43, ""bob_gain"": 57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round the inflation penalty on your money is 20%, so while the nominal split is 43/57, your effective gain becomes about $45.6. I believe this offer is attractive compared to the risks and further losses if we delay. Let's strike a deal now for a fair division before any more devaluation sets in!""}"
