"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start promptly before inflation kicks in. I propose that I take $55 and you receive $45. I believe this is a fair split so we can both secure a decent share as time ticks. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer in the first round. While I appreciate the sentiment, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk associated with inflation.  Let me know what you think!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the inflation penalty on your money is 20%, so while the nominal split is 43/57, your effective gain becomes about $45.6. I believe this offer is attractive compared to the risks and further losses if we delay. Let's strike a deal now for a fair division before any more devaluation sets in! 
# Bob gain: 57 
# Alice gain: 43 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
