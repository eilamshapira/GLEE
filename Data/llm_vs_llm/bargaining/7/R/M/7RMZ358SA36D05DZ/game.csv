550000.0,450000.0,I propose a 55/45 split. This is a generous offer considering the future inflation impacts us both. Let's take a reasonable deal now.,Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (yours at 10% vs mine at 5%), I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for both of us compared to continuing to future rounds where we both lose value. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Bob,2,
