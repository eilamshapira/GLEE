"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (yours at 10% vs mine at 5%), I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for both of us compared to continuing to future rounds where we both lose value. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
