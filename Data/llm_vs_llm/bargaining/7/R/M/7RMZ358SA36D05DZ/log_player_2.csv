"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55/45 split. This is a generous offer considering the future inflation impacts us both. Let's take a reasonable deal now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice proposes I receive 45% ($450,000) while she gets 55% ($550,000).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice. This means we'd be dividing effectively $950,000 from my perspective and $900,000 from Alice's perspective.

This inflation structure gives me a slight advantage in later rounds, as Alice loses value faster than I do. I could potentially propose a more favorable split next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that recognizes our different inflation rates while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (yours at 10% vs mine at 5%), I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for both of us compared to continuing to future rounds where we both lose value. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
