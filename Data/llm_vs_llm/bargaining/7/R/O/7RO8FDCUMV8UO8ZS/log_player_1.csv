"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering the inflation penalty I face if we extend the negotiation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without needing additional rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid any further rounds and the potential for inflation to affect our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
