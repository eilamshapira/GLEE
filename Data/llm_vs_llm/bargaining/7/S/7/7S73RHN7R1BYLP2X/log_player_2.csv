"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest this fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we delay, I lose value faster than you (20% vs 10%), so we both benefit from agreeing now. This division gives us both substantial amounts while acknowledging the time pressure affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
