60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial portion right away without risking inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both need to reach an agreement quickly. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair counter-offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that delays hurt my position more than yours. Let's avoid further rounds of negotiation and agree to this balanced split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, we should reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you $35, which is worth about $31.5 to you now due to inflation. If we keep going, your position will only get worse. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I notice you've actually reduced your offer to me from $40 to $35, which isn't moving us toward compromise. I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair regardless of inflation factors. We're now in round 4, and with 12 rounds total, we risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon. This even split respects both our interests and should allow us to conclude the negotiation. Given the inflation pressure, this is my final reasonable offer.",Bob,4,
