"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial portion right away without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I take $40 while she takes $60. With the 10% inflation per round affecting me, if I reject and we go to the next round, my maximum potential value would decrease. However, since I'll be making the next proposal if I reject, I could potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer considering the inflation factor that affects me. I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our interests.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both need to reach an agreement quickly. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair counter-offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that delays hurt my position more than yours. Let's avoid further rounds of negotiation and agree to this balanced split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, we should reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you $35, which is worth about $31.5 to you now due to inflation. If we keep going, your position will only get worse. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $35, which she points out is worth about $31.5 to me due to the 19% inflation that has occurred over these rounds. She's taking $65 for herself and her value doesn't decrease with rounds.

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where inflation will be even higher (approximately 27% from the original value), and I'll be making the next offer. This means my bargaining position is getting weaker with each round due to inflation.

Alice has actually decreased her offer from $40 to $35, taking advantage of my weakening position due to inflation. This doesn't seem fair since she's trying to exploit the inflation pressure I'm under rather than moving toward a compromise.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I notice you've actually reduced your offer to me from $40 to $35, which isn't moving us toward compromise. I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair regardless of inflation factors. We're now in round 4, and with 12 rounds total, we risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon. This even split respects both our interests and should allow us to conclude the negotiation. Given the inflation pressure, this is my final reasonable offer.""}"
