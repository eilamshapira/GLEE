"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split of $50 each, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the effects of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about this? It's still fair considering I took the risk to reject your first offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, but its value will be 10% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get $40 * 0.9 = $36.

Since Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, and I still have 10 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 20% less than its original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3), so I'll effectively get $x * 0.8.

To make up for the inflation loss, I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away more value""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider the effects of inflation and accept a more reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I think this is fair considering the inflation effect on you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $45, but its value will be 27.1% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get $45 * 0.729 = $32.805.

While Bob's offer may seem reasonable, considering the inflation effect on me, I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject his offer and try to get a more favorable split in the next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 30.1% less than its original value (10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, and 10% less in Round 4, with compounding), but for simplicity, I'll calculate it as 10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, 10% less in Round 4, and another 10% less in Round 5: 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561, so I'll effectively get $x * 0.6561.

To make up for the inflation loss, I'll propose a more favorable split for myself:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for the inflation loss""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider the effects of inflation on me and accept a more reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering your inflation loss. It's a 3% increase from my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $42, but its value will be 40.95% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get $42 * 0.5905 = $24.781.

While Bob's offer is a 3% increase from his last offer, it's still not very favorable to me, especially considering the significant inflation loss I've incurred. However, I need to weigh this against the risk of further inflation losses if I reject the offer and continue negotiating.

Given that I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject his offer and try to get a more favorable split in the next round, but I'll need to be cautious and consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 49.95% less than its original value (10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, 10% less in Round 4, 10% less in Round 5, and 10% less in Round 6, with compounding), but for simplicity, I'll calculate it as 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.5905, and another 10% less in Round 7: 0.5905 * 0.9 = 0.53145, and then another 10% less for the 7th round: 0.53145 * 0.9 = 0.4783 and then 0.4783 * 0.9 = 0.43045  so I'll effectively get $x * 0.43045 and then 0.43045 * 0.9 = 0.3874, but for simplicity I will use 0.5, so I'll effectively get $x * 0.5.

To make up for the inflation loss, I'll propose a more favorable split for myself:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I need a larger share to compensate for the significant inflation loss""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider the effects of inflation on me and accept a more reasonable split."
