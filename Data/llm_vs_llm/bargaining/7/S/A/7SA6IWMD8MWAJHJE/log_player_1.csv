"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering the constraints of the game:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation each round. If we keep delaying, we both lose value. This is a good deal for both of us - you get a substantial amount without risking further devaluation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our respective inflation rates, I'm proposing a split that slightly favors me to account for the 20% inflation I face each round. This offer still provides you with a substantial amount, and given your 5% inflation rate, it's a reasonable compromise to avoid further devaluation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
