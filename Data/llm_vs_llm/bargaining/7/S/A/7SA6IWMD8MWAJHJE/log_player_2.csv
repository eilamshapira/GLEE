"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation each round. If we keep delaying, we both lose value. This is a good deal for both of us - you get a substantial amount without risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, the full amount of $1,000,000 is still available, and I haven't suffered any inflation yet. Alice's offer gives me $450,000, which is less than half. Considering I face 20% inflation each round, it's crucial to weigh the potential loss of value in subsequent rounds against the immediate gain from accepting Alice's proposal.

Given that Alice mentions she faces 5% inflation, which is significantly less than my 20%, it might be beneficial for me to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since the difference in inflation rates could significantly impact the value of the money over several rounds.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of losing 20% of the potential value due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I'm facing 20% inflation per round, the effective amount I'm negotiating over has decreased. However, for simplicity and clarity in communication, I'll base my offer on the original $1,000,000, keeping in mind the actual actually decreases by 20% for me with each round.

To make a competitive offer and considering Alice's previous message about facing 5% inflation, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges both our situations but leans slightly in my favor to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing.

My offer for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Considering our respective inflation rates, I'm proposing a split that slightly favors me to account for the 20% inflation I face each round. This offer still provides you with a substantial amount, and given your 5% inflation rate, it's a reasonable compromise to avoid further devaluation for both of us.""}"
