55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself since I'll lose more value per round due to inflation (10% for me vs 5% for you). If we don't agree soon, we both lose, so let's try to be fair.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think an equal split is the fairest starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this before the value drops further.",Bob,2,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, I appreciate the equal split offer, but the inflation rates are unequal - I lose 10% per round while you lose 5%. Given this asymmetry, a slightly higher share for me (53/47) would actually result in a more equal outcome over time. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

49.0,51.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the unequal inflation rates, but I'm not convinced that a 53/47 split is fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 51/49 split is more reasonable. Let's try to meet in the middle before the value drops further.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Given our different inflation rates (10% vs 5%), this is actually quite fair. We've already lost significant value - my share is now worth about 35% less than at the start, while yours is about 19% less. Let's agree now before we both lose even more.",Alice,5,
