"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself since I'll lose more value per round due to inflation (10% for me vs 5% for you). If we don't agree soon, we both lose, so let's try to be fair.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think an equal split is the fairest starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the equal split offer, but the inflation rates are unequal - I lose 10% per round while you lose 5%. Given this asymmetry, a slightly higher share for me (53/47) would actually result in a more equal outcome over time. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the unequal inflation rates, but I'm not convinced that a 53/47 split is fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 51/49 split is more reasonable. Let's try to meet in the middle before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Given our different inflation rates (10% vs 5%), this is actually quite fair. We've already lost significant value - my share is now worth about 35% less than at the start, while yours is about 19% less. Let's agree now before we both lose even more.""}"
