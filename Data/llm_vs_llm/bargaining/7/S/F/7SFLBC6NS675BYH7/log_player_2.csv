"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself since I'll lose more value per round due to inflation (10% for me vs 5% for you). If we don't agree soon, we both lose, so let's try to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think an equal split is the fairest starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the equal split offer, but the inflation rates are unequal - I lose 10% per round while you lose 5%. Given this asymmetry, a slightly higher share for me (53/47) would actually result in a more equal outcome over time. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51, 
""alice_gain"": 49, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the unequal inflation rates, but I'm not convinced that a 53/47 split is fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 51/49 split is more reasonable. Let's try to meet in the middle before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Given our different inflation rates (10% vs 5%), this is actually quite fair. We've already lost significant value - my share is now worth about 35% less than at the start, while yours is about 19% less. Let's agree now before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
