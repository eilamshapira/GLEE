"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob has no time pressure (0% depreciation) while I face 5% depreciation per round. I should aim for a fair but advantageous split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept it, while still giving me a good portion. If Bob declines, the next round my money will be worth 5% less, so I'm incentivized to make a decent offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is an extremely unfair offer from Bob, offering me just $1. Even with the 5% depreciation per round affecting my share, I'm better off rejecting this and making a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round. The money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round, but that's still better than accepting just $1 now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's extremely aggressive previous offer, I need to adjust my strategy while still protecting my interests. The money is now worth 10% less to me than in round 1, so I need to be more strategic.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a more favorable split for Bob compared to my first offer, moving from 60-40 to 55-45. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable position for myself. Even with the 10% depreciation, this would give me an effective value of 495,000$, which is much better than Bob's previous unfair offer. I hope this more balanced proposal will encourage cooperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30000 
# Bob gain: 970000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob has increased his offer from $1 to $30,000, it's still extremely unfair. Even with my 14.26% depreciation, I can do better by continuing to negotiate. My $30,000 would only be worth about $25,722 with the current depreciation, while Bob keeps $970,000 at full value.

The game still has 8 rounds left, and even though I'm facing increasing depreciation, I should continue to push for a more equitable distribution. In the next round, I can make another offer that's more favorable to Bob while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's pattern of low offers and rejections, I need to make a more significant concession while still maintaining a reasonable position for myself. With my money now worth about 19% less than round 1, I need to balance the urgency of reaching an agreement with maintaining a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the most equitable division possible. Even with my depreciation, this would give me an effective value of about $405,000, which is significantly better than Bob's previous offers. This equal split demonstrates my commitment to fairness and should be harder for Bob to justify rejecting. It's a strong focal point for negotiation, and refusing an equal split might make Bob appear unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although Bob has increased his offer to $100,000 (which would be worth about $77,380 to me after the 22.62% depreciation), this is still far from a fair split. We're halfway through the rounds, and while my depreciation is significant, there's still room to negotiate for a better deal.

Bob seems to be gradually increasing his offers ($1 → $30,000 → $100,000), which suggests he might be willing to come up higher. Even with increasing depreciation, I can still try to negotiate for a more equitable split in the next round. With 6 rounds remaining, rejecting this unbalanced offer is still the better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's gradually increasing offers and my increasing depreciation (now around 27%), I need to make a more substantial concession while still maintaining a dignified position.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm now offering Bob a 60-40 split in his favor, which is a significant shift from my previous offers. With my current depreciation, my $400,000 would be worth approximately $292,000, which is still significantly better than Bob's last offer of $100,000. This offer demonstrates substantial movement toward Bob's position while still preserving a meaningful share for myself. The 60-40 split is a common negotiation point that might appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while acknowledging his stronger position due to my time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob has reverted to his extremely unfair initial offer of just $1, which suggests he might be trying to pressure me into accepting a very low offer in later rounds. Even with my 30.17% depreciation, rejecting this offer is clearly the better choice. There are still 4 rounds remaining, and even though my depreciation will continue to increase, accepting $1 (which would be worth about $0.70 after depreciation) is worse than continuing to negotiate.

This aggressive move from Bob actually gives me information: he's willing to make extreme offers rather than move toward a reasonable compromise. In the next round, I'll need to adjust my strategy accordingly while still protecting myself from such an unfair outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's pattern of aggressive negotiation and reversion to extreme offers, I need to make a more dramatic concession while still protecting myself from a near-zero outcome. With my depreciation now around 34%, time is becoming critical.

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}

I'm offering a 70-30 split in Bob's favor, which is my most substantial concession yet. With my current depreciation, my $300,000 would be worth approximately $198,000, which is still far better than Bob's minimal offers. This 70-30 split acknowledges Bob's stronger negotiating position due to his immunity to depreciation, while still preserving a meaningful amount for me. If Bob continues to reject reasonable offers like this, it suggests he might be playing a very aggressive strategy aiming for an extremely uneven split in the final rounds."
