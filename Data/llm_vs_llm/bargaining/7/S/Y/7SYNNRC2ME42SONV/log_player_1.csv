"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering the inflation, I want to secure a good portion for myself early on.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's offer, I need to decide.

My money is worth 10% less: $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000 (effectively)
Bob's money is worth 20% less: $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 (effectively)

Bob is offering me $450,000 now. This is a loss compared to the first round.

However, if I reject, I'll be making the offer next, and the money will be worth even less for me.

Let's analyze it this way:

*   If I accept: $450,000 (nominal)
*   If I reject: the nominal amount would be 10% less.

Considering the risk of the game and the inflation, I think it is better to accept this offer.
