"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split as it is the most equitable way to divide the money. This way, we both walk away with an equal share, benefiting us equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation for me, $5000 is now worth $4750 to me
2. The alternative is making a new offer next round, but then my share would be worth 10% less
3. This is a fair 50-50 split, and waiting longer will only decrease the value further
4. Even though I initially asked for more, getting $4750 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation
