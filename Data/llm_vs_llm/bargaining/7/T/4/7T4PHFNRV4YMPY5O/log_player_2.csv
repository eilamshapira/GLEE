"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * My $40 would be worth only $32 next round (20% less)
   * Alice's $60 would be worth $57 next round (5% less)
4. This means waiting is more costly for me than for Alice
5. While the split isn't perfectly equal, $40 is a reasonable offer

The inflation penalty makes waiting costly, especially for me. While I could try to negotiate for more, I risk losing more value than I might gain.
