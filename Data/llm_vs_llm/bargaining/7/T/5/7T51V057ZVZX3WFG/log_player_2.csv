"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair at face value, Alice's phrasing suggests she might be getting a better deal.  The inflation rate is also heavily in my favor. It's worth seeing what kind of offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. This offer keeps things fair considering the inflation.""} 

**Reasoning:**  This offer is slightly in my favor, reflecting the inflation dynamic. It also gives Alice a reasonable amount, making it more likely she'll accept rather than risk further devaluation in the next round."
