Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation losses. This way, we both get a fair share without risking more value loss in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
