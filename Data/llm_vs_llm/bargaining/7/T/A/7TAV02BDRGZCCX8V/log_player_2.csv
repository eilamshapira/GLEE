"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly! I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This gives us both a significant amount, and avoids us losing value to inflation in later rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $8000 (10,000 * 0.8). I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation losses. This way, we both get a fair share without risking more value loss in subsequent rounds.""}"
