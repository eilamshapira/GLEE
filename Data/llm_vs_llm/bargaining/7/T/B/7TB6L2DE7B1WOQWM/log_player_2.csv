"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 400,000$ (40%) and keeping 600,000$ (60%)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * This gives me some negotiating leverage

Given that:
- Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%)
- I can make the next offer if I reject
- There are still plenty of rounds left
- 40/60 split isn't terrible but I think I can do better

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 40/60 split, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it. Given that:

1. Alice's money devalues faster (10% per round vs my 5%)
2. She might be motivated to accept sooner rather than later
3. But she still needs to find the offer fair enough to accept

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

My reasoning for this 55/45 split:
- It's more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer
- But not so greedy that Alice would definitely reject
- If Alice rejects, her next counter-offer will be worth less to her due to the 10% inflation
- This gives her incentive to accept now rather than drag out negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has made a more favorable offer than her first one (moved from 40/60 to 45/55)
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $450,000 is actually worth $406,125 (450,000 * 0.9025)
   * Alice's $550,000 is actually worth $445,500 (550,000 * 0.81)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth another 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth another 10% less
   * I can make another counter-offer

While Alice has improved her offer, the inflation is starting to eat into both our shares significantly. However, I think there's still room for negotiation, and since Alice's money devalues faster than mine, I have some leverage to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a new offer next round that accounts for the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the mounting inflation pressure (my money is now worth 14.25% less and Alice's is worth 27.1% less than round 1), I need to make a strategic offer. The longer this goes, the less we both get, but Alice is losing value faster.

Since Alice's last offer was 45/55, and considering the accelerating inflation, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000}

My reasoning:
1. This 57.5/42.5 split accounts for:
   - The fact that Alice's money is devaluing faster
   - The need to reach agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value
   - That Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her previous offers
2. With inflation, my $575,000 is worth about $493,062 to me
3. Alice's $425,000 is worth about $309,825 to her
4. If Alice rejects, her next offer will be worth even less due to 10% inflation per round
5. This creates pressure to reach an agreement while still giving me a better position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer:

1. Alice has proposed a 50/50 split, which appears fair on the surface
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $407,250 (500,000 * 0.8145)
   * Alice's $500,000 is actually worth $328,050 (500,000 * 0.6561)
3. This is Alice's most favorable offer yet (moved from 40/60 to 45/55 to now 50/50)
4. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth another 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth another 10% less
   * We're already 5 rounds in, with significant value lost

Given that:
- We're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds
- Alice has made a fair 50/50 offer
- Inflation is seriously eroding both our potential gains
- The next round would mean even more value lost
- Alice has shown consistent improvement in her offers

I think it's time to accept. Further negotiation might lead to higher nominal amounts but lower real values due to inflation.
