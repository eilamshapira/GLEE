"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since I'm Alice and I make the first offer, I need to make it appealing enough for Bob to accept, but also maximize my gain considering the rapidly increasing inflation for me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $40. This is a significant amount upfront, which should be attractive given his relatively low inflation rate (5% per round).
*   I keep $60 for myself. This gives me a larger initial amount, mitigating the impact of my higher inflation rate (20% per round)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the value of the money now. My initial $1 is now worth $0.8, and Bob's initial $1 is worth $0.95.

Let's analyze Bob's offer: Alice gets $45, and Bob gets $55.

My valuation of Bob's offer: $45 * 0.8 = $36

If I reject, I will have to make an offer next round with even greater inflation on my side. Therefore, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
