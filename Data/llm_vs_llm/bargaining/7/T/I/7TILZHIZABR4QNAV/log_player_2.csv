"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, inflation will reduce the value:
   - For me: 5% less (100 * 0.95 = 95$ total value)
   - For Alice: 20% less (100 * 0.80 = 80$ total value)
4. Alice's high inflation rate gives me negotiating leverage

I'll reject this first offer. With Alice's higher inflation rate, she has more incentive to reach a deal quickly, and I should be able to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice faces higher inflation pressure (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a split more in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a fair offer considering:
1. Alice has more urgency to deal due to higher inflation
2. It's still early in the game, giving Alice a good value
3. It's a reasonable improvement from her initial 40/60 offer"
