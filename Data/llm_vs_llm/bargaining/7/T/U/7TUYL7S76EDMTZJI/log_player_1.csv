Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm aware of the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. Let's split it evenly and both walk away with $5000. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances. While I could try for a better deal, the inflation means I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer from Bob later. Accepting a sure $5000 is better than risking getting nothing."
