"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This isn't an equal split, and I need to remember that with each round, my share loses 10% of its value due to inflation.

If I reject and move to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but my $4,000 would already be worth only $3,600 in the next round. I need to weigh the potential benefit of negotiating against the guaranteed loss from inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable counter-offer while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm aware of the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. Let's split it evenly and both walk away with $5,000.""}"
