550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $1000000 so that I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. By accepting this offer now, we both avoid the impact of inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I propose we reverse the split. I take $550000 and you take $450000. This is a fairer deal considering my losses due to inflation in the long run.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I understand your previous offer aimed to mitigate future losses. However, every round we delay, my share loses 5% in real value, and Iâ€™m eager to secure a deal now before my funds devalue further. I propose an immediate 50-50 split of the $1000000, ensuring we both walk away with our agreed amounts without exposing either of us to additional risks. I hope you agree that settling now benefits both parties.",Alice,3,
