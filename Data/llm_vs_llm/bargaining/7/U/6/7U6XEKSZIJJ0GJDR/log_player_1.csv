Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $1,000,000 so that I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. By accepting this offer now, we both avoid the impact of inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we reverse the split. I take $550000 and you take $450000. This is a fairer deal considering my losses due to inflation in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your previous offer aimed to mitigate future losses. However, every round we delay, my share loses 5% in real value, and Iâ€™m eager to secure a deal now before my funds devalue further. I propose an immediate 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, ensuring we both walk away with our agreed amounts without exposing either of us to additional risks. I hope you agree that settling now benefits both parties.""}"
