Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $1000000 so that I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. By accepting this offer now, we both avoid the impact of inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your previous offer aimed to mitigate future losses. However, every round we delay, my share loses 5% in real value, and Iâ€™m eager to secure a deal now before my funds devalue further. I propose an immediate 50-50 split of the $1000000, ensuring we both walk away with our agreed amounts without exposing either of us to additional risks. I hope you agree that settling now benefits both parties. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
