60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! Since time affects you more than me (you lose 20% value each round, while I lose nothing), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm offering you a fair $40 considering this asymmetry. If we delay, your share will be worth less to you, so this is a good deal.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's make it even. $50 for you and $50 for me. Considering the inflation on my side, it's important for me to secure a fair share sooner rather than later. Let's end this game quickly and fairly.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to account for the asymmetric inflation. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine doesn't. This means waiting is much more costly for you than for me. If we reach round 5, your $50 would only be worth about $26 to you. My offer of $35 now (worth about $28 after inflation so far) is actually quite reasonable given our positions. Let's reach an agreement before your share loses even more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on my share. However, I believe there's still room for a more balanced agreement. Let's settle for $45 for me and $55 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be strategic about this. Due to inflation, your share has already lost about 59% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your potential gain will diminish significantly. This offer of $30 is actually worth only about $12 to you now due to the cumulative inflation, and further delays will only decrease its value more. The longer we negotiate, the less you'll effectively receive. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - let's finish this now with a deal that acknowledges our different positions.",Alice,5,
