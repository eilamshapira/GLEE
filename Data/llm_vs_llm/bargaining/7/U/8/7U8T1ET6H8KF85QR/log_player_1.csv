"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that takes into account the asymmetric time pressure we face.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since time affects you more than me (you lose 20% value each round, while I lose nothing), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm offering you a fair $40 considering this asymmetry. If we delay, your share will be worth less to you, so this is a good deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's make it even. $50 for you and $50 for me. Considering the inflation on my side, it's important for me to secure a fair share sooner rather than later. Let's end this game quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to account for the asymmetric inflation. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine doesn't. This means waiting is much more costly for you than for me. If we reach round 5, your $50 would only be worth about $26 to you. My offer of $35 now (worth about $28 after inflation so far) is actually quite reasonable given our positions. Let's reach an agreement before your share loses even more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on my share. However, I believe there's still room for a more balanced agreement. Let's settle for $45 for me and $55 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic about this. Due to inflation, your share has already lost about 59% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your potential gain will diminish significantly. This offer of $30 is actually worth only about $12 to you now due to the cumulative inflation, and further delays will only decrease its value more. The longer we negotiate, the less you'll effectively receive. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - let's finish this now with a deal that acknowledges our different positions.""}"
