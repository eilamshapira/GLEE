"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since time affects you more than me (you lose 20% value each round, while I lose nothing), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm offering you a fair $40 considering this asymmetry. If we delay, your share will be worth less to you, so this is a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can offer a bit more, considering the inflation effect on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's make it even. $50 for you and $50 for me. Considering the inflation on my side, it's important for me to secure a fair share sooner rather than later. Let's end this game quickly and fairly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to account for the asymmetric inflation. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine doesn't. This means waiting is much more costly for you than for me. If we reach round 5, your $50 would only be worth about $26 to you. My offer of $35 now (worth about $28 after inflation so far) is actually quite reasonable given our positions. Let's reach an agreement before your share loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can offer a bit more, considering the inflation effect on my side. I understand that time is of the essence, but I think Alice can still offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on my share. However, I believe there's still room for a more balanced agreement. Let's settle for $45 for me and $55 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic about this. Due to inflation, your share has already lost about 59% of its value. If we continue for several more rounds, your potential gain will diminish significantly. This offer of $30 is actually worth only about $12 to you now due to the cumulative inflation, and further delays will only decrease its value more. The longer we negotiate, the less you'll effectively receive. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - let's finish this now with a deal that acknowledges our different positions. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, it's better to secure some value now rather than risk losing more in further rounds."
