"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round. 

Even if I could propose a better split in round 2, the maximum I could get would be $80 (if Alice accepted my proposal for all of it), which is less than what I'd get by accepting $45 now.
