Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the current value for me is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount of $10,000. I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than half, considering I'm making the offer now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally this time. Considering the inflation, this seems like the fairest deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money I gain is 64% of the original value (100% - 36% = 64%). So, the $5,000 I would gain is actually worth $5,000 * 0.64 = $3,200 to me.

On the other hand, Alice's gain is worth 81% of the original value (100% - 19% = 81%). So, the $5,000 she would gain is actually worth $5,000 * 0.81 = $4,050 to her.

Given this situation, accepting the offer seems like the best option, as it allows me to get a significant portion of the value, considering the inflation affecting my gain.
