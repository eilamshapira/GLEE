Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60-40 is still too far off. Let's try 70-30.

# Alice gain: 700000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
