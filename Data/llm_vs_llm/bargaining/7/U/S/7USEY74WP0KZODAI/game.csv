550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! Considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to account for my inflation risk. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount right now rather than losing value through negotiations.",Alice,1,
