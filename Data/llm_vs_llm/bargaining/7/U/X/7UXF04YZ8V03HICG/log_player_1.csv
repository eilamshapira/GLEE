"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that is fair and respects the time pressure of this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the $10,000. This is fair to both of us and avoids the risk of losing value through inflation in later rounds."
