2000.0,8000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $2000 and you get $8000. Think about it – if you reject and move to Round 2, the total pot drops by 20% (to $8000), and you’d then get all of that as the proposer. Why not lock in $8000 now rather than risk further discounting? I believe this is fair given the future value erosion.",Alice,1,
