"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $2,000 and you get $8,000. Think about it – if you reject and move to Round 2, the total pot drops by 20% (to $8,000), and you’d then get all of that as the proposer. Why not lock in $8,000 now rather than risk further discounting? I believe this is fair given the future value erosion.""}"
