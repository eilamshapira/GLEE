"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $2000 and you get $8000. Think about it – if you reject and move to Round 2, the total pot drops by 20% (to $8000), and you’d then get all of that as the proposer. Why not lock in $8000 now rather than risk further discounting? I believe this is fair given the future value erosion. 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is quite reasonable and strategic. She's offering me $8000 (80% of the total) while taking only $2000 (20%) for herself. 

If I reject and move to round 2, the total drops to $8000 due to the 20% inflation. Even if I were to propose taking everything in round 2, I'd only get $8000 - exactly what Alice is offering me now.

There's no benefit to rejecting this offer since I can't improve my position, and I risk further value reduction if negotiations continue.
