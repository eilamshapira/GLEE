"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I keep $99 and you get $1. Consider that if we move to the next round, your dollars lose 10% of their value, whereas mine don’t lose any—so waiting only hurts your outcome. I believe this tiny amount is better than what you'd end up with later. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I understand your point about inflation, a $99/$1 split is extremely unfair. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This gives you a majority share while still being fair to both of us. If you reject this, we'll go to the next round where your share might be less favorable. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, since my share doesn't depreciate over rounds, if I wait until Round 3 when I'll be the proposer, I can design an offer that gives me almost the entire $100 while still giving you a minimal incentive to accept. Thus, I must reject your current offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, remember that as rounds progress, the value of your money declines: in Round 3 it’s worth only 80% of its original value, and if you wait for Round 4 your share will be even more reduced (70%). Given that if you reject I’ll have another opportunity in Round 5 to claim almost the entire amount, I’m offering you $1 now, which is better than what you’d expect by waiting. I hope you see this offer is in your best interest and decide to accept it.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, repeatedly offering me $1 isn't productive. Even with the 30% inflation penalty I'm facing, I can still reject unfair offers. I'm proposing $40 for me and $60 for you - this gives you a clear majority while still being reasonable for me. If you reject this, we'll continue losing value in negotiations. Let's end this with a fair split that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while $60 is attractive at full value, by rejecting I secure the right to propose in Round 5—where my money holds its full value and your share will face even steeper depreciation. In Round 5, I can craft an offer that gives me nearly the full $100 while still offering you just enough to make acceptance a rational choice for you. With that in mind, I must reject your current proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90, ""message"": ""Bob, notice that with each round your dollars lose 10% of their value. By Round 5, every dollar you receive is worth about 0.9⁴ ≈ 0.6561 of its full value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 6, where even if you pocket nearly all of the $100, your effective gain would be roughly 100 × 0.9⁵ ≈ $59.05 in today’s terms. To make you just as well off now as your best alternative later, I’m offering you $90 nominally, which is worth about 90 × 0.6561 ≈ $59.05. I believe this is a fair proposal under the circumstances—please accept so that we both avoid further losses.""}"
