"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I keep $99 and you get $1. Consider that if we move to the next round, your dollars lose 10% of their value, whereas mine don’t lose any—so waiting only hurts your outcome. I believe this tiny amount is better than what you'd end up with later. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $1 is extremely unfair, and even with the 10% penalty in the next round, I can make a more reasonable counteroffer. In the next round, the $100 will be worth $90 to me, but I can still propose a much better split than $1/$99."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I understand your point about inflation, a $99/$1 split is extremely unfair. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This gives you a majority share while still being fair to both of us. If you reject this, we'll go to the next round where your share might be less favorable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, remember that as rounds progress, the value of your money declines: in Round 3 it’s worth only 80% of its original value, and if you wait for Round 4 your share will be even more reduced (70%). Given that if you reject I’ll have another opportunity in Round 5 to claim almost the entire amount, I’m offering you $1 now, which is better than what you’d expect by waiting. I hope you see this offer is in your best interest and decide to accept it. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the 19% reduction in value, this offer is still extremely unfair. If I make a counteroffer in the next round for a 50-50 split, I would get $50 * 0.81 = $40.50 in effective value, which is much better than $1. Alice's strategy of offering the minimum amount isn't optimal because I can still make better counteroffers despite the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, 
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Alice, repeatedly offering me $1 isn't productive. Even with the 30% inflation penalty I'm facing, I can still reject unfair offers. I'm proposing $40 for me and $60 for you - this gives you a clear majority while still being reasonable for me. If you reject this, we'll continue losing value in negotiations. Let's end this with a fair split that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, notice that with each round your dollars lose 10% of their value. By Round 5, every dollar you receive is worth about 0.9⁴ ≈ 0.6561 of its full value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 6, where even if you pocket nearly all of the $100, your effective gain would be roughly 100 × 0.9⁵ ≈ $59.05 in today’s terms. To make you just as well off now as your best alternative later, I’m offering you $90 nominally, which is worth about 90 × 0.6561 ≈ $59.05. I believe this is a fair proposal under the circumstances—please accept so that we both avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 90 
# Alice gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is actually a fair offer considering the inflation effect. The $90 I receive, even with the 34.39% penalty, is worth approximately $59.05 in original value terms. If I were to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, even if I proposed to take the entire $100, it would be worth less due to the additional 10% inflation penalty. Alice has made a mathematically sound offer that gives me the best possible outcome at this point in the game. I'll accept."
