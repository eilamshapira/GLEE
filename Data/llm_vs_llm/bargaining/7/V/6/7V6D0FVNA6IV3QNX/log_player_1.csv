I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to counter with a 60/40 split. Even with the inflation, this is still a good deal for me, and it's likely Bob will accept it to avoid further risk of inflation."
