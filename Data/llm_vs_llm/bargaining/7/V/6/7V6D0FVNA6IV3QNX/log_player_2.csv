"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a more equitable division where I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. This is a fair offer considering we both deserve a substantial portion, and I'm facing 10% inflation with each round. This way we both walk away with a significant amount rather than continuing negotiations where the total value decreases for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
