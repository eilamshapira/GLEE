55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since inflation affects me by 5% each round. This is a fair offer that gives you a significant portion while allowing us to close the deal now without losing value to inflation.",Alice,1,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, I see we're both facing inflation penalties, with yours being more severe at 20%. Let's find a middle ground. This offer is better for you than my first one and recognizes our different inflation rates. If we don't reach agreement now, we'll both lose more value in the next round. This is fair given our respective circumstances.",Alice,3,
