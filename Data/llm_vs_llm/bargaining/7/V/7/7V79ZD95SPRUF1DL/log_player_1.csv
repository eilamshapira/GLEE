"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since inflation affects me by 5% each round. This is a fair offer that gives you a significant portion while allowing us to close the deal now without losing value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 20% inflation effect on my side, I'm making a competitive offer. Accepting now will save us both from further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, 
""bob_gain"": 47, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both facing inflation penalties, with yours being more severe at 20%. Let's find a middle ground. This offer is better for you than my first one and recognizes our different inflation rates. If we don't reach agreement now, we'll both lose more value in the next round. This is fair given our respective circumstances.""}"
