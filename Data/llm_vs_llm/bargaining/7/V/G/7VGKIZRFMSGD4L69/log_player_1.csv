"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money. If Bob rejects, the next round's $100 will only be worth $90 to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $40.50 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth even less (20% less than original value)
- Bob's offer is giving him slightly more ($55), but it's reasonable

Given that waiting another round would reduce the value significantly more for me, and this is a fairly balanced offer even with the inflation effect...
