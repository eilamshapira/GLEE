60.0,40.0,Fair share for both,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.,Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,Meet in the middle of my first offer and your equal split,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Based on our inflation rates (yours at 36% after 3 rounds, mine at only 9.75%), delays are much more costly for you. This 55/45 split actually favors you when accounting for inflation differences. Further negotiations will significantly reduce your potential gains due to your high inflation rate.",Bob,4,
