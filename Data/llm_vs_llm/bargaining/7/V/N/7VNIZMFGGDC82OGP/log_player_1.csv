I propose keeping 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering to keep 850,000 for myself and give 150,000 to Bob. This is still a significant gain for him, and I'm hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
