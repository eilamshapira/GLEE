"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","Another attempt by Alice to take it all.

Since the money is worth 19% less for me, I'd be getting $0 * 0.81 = $0, which is still $0. I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 10% less for me each round, so after 3 rounds, it's worth approximately $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $100 * 0.729 = $72.9 for me. 

I'll aim to get a bit more than half of the original $100, considering the reduced value for me.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 90 
# Alice gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","A surprisingly generous offer from Alice!

Considering the inflation, the $90 I'd receive is worth approximately $90 * (1 - 0.3439) = $90 * 0.6561 = $59.05 to me.

However, this is still a significant amount, and I should consider accepting it, given the diminishing value of the money for me.
