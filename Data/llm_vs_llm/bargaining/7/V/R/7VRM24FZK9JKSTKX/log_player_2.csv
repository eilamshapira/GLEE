"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and this is the first round I'm making an offer, I'll take that into consideration. However, for the sake of simplicity in calculation, let's first determine the offer without considering the depreciation, and then adjust accordingly.

A fair split would be 50/50, but considering Alice's initial offer and the fact that the money depreciates more for me, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself to account for the future rounds' depreciation.

Initial thought: 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Alice.

However, considering the 20% depreciation for me in this round (since Alice's offer was in round 1), the actual value I'm proposing for myself in today's value is 550,000 * 0.8 = 440,000, and for Alice, it remains 450,000 (since her depreciation is 5%, but we apply depreciation after the offer is made or accepted).

So, my offer in nominal terms remains as initially thought, but keep in mind the real value for me is less due to depreciation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for both of us, especially you! This is a fair deal while we still have something substantial to split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the depreciation, for me (Bob), the offer of $400,000 is worth 36% less than its original value, which means its value to me is 400,000 * (1 - 0.36) = 400,000 * 0.64 = $256,000 in today's value.

For Alice, the $600,000 she proposes to take is worth 9.75% less, so its value to her is 600,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = 600,000 * 0.9025 = $541,500 in today's value.

Given this significant disparity and the fact that the value of money continues to decrease, especially for me, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a substantial amount now rather than risking further depreciation.
