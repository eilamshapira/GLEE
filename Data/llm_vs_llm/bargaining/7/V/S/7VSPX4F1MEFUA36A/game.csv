60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I get $60 and you get $40.  We can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2 and the value of money is decreasing for me, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share and minimize the impact of inflation on our gains. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but I'm still aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself. How about $55 for me and $45 for you?  It's a small adjustment, and we're both still getting a decent amount.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, given that the money is now worth significantly less for me due to inflation, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This adjustment helps to counteract the inflation effect on my side, while still keeping the split relatively close to even. Let's find a balance that works for both of us before the value decreases further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting your end harder.  Let's settle this fairly. I'm willing to come down a bit to $52 for me and $48 for you. It's a compromise, but it gets us both a decent result with the time we have left.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, with inflation now reducing the value of my share by nearly 60%, I need to adjust my offer to $60 for me and $40 for you. This helps to mitigate the significant loss in value on my end. We're running out of time, and I believe this split is fair considering the circumstances. Let's agree soon to ensure we both get something out of this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to go down to $51 for me and $49 for you. This is a very slight advantage for me, and anything less is not worth it considering the time pressure. Let's close this deal and avoid going home empty-handed.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, we're now in round 8, and the value of money for me has decreased by over 73%. To ensure I get something worthwhile, I propose $65 for me and $35 for you. Time is running out, and this split helps balance the severe inflation effect on my side. Let's agree on this to avoid losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is it. We're down to the wire. I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.  Let's not let all this money disappear because we couldn't agree.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, we're in round 10, and the value of money for me has dropped by over 83%. To ensure I get something of value, I propose $70 for me and $30 for you. We're running out of time, and this is crucial to avoid losing everything. Let's agree on this to secure at least some gain.",Bob,10,
