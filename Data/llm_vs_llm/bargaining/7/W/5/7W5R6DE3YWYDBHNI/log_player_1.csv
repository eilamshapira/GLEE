"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that any delay affects me more than Bob due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage to account for the inflation risk I face in future rounds. It's a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
- Due to 10% inflation, my $50 is actually worth $45 to me
- Bob gets full $50 value

If I reject and we go to round 3:
- I'll face another 10% inflation
- I might be able to negotiate better, but the decreasing value makes it risky
- Bob has no inflation pressure and can afford to wait

Given that the value is already eroding for me and Bob made a numerically fair offer, I'll accept rather than risk further value loss.
