"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since I know inflation will affect my gains by 10% each round, I want to secure a good deal early, but also be fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, which still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. While it's tilted in my favor, it's not so extreme that it should immediately be rejected. If Bob rejects this, they'll make a counter-offer, but my next opportunity will be worth 10% less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. For me, due to 10% inflation, $450,000 is actually worth $405,000 (450,000 * 0.9)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth only 80% of the original value
3. Bob's current offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible
4. If I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to increasing inflation
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. Getting $405,000 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation.
