Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. You're losing value with each round, so it's in your best interest to accept. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
