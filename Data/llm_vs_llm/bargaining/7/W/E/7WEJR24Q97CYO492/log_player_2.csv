"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. 

I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than half of the effective amount, considering the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still better for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount I'm getting is $420,000 * 0.64 (since 20% less each round: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) = $268,800.

However, I should compare this to what I could potentially get in the next round. If I reject this offer, the effective amount I'd be dividing in the next round would be $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $512,000. But I'd want more than half of that, considering I'm the one making the offer.

Given the numbers, Alice's offer might not be the best, but it's better than risking further inflation.
