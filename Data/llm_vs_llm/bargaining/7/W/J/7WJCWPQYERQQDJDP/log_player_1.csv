"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob to split $10,000. I need to consider the inflation effect for me, but I don't know how it affects Bob. I want to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, while also maximizing my potential gain.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $4500. This is a significant portion of the money, and might incentivize him to accept it immediately.
*   I'm asking for $5500 for myself. It takes the inflation into consideration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1. Bob's money is worth 20% less than in Round 1. This is crucial information.
*   **Bob's offer:** I get $6000, Bob gets $4000.

Let's consider the perceived value:

*   **My Value of $6000:**  Since the inflation is 5%, my perceived value of $6000 now is equivalent to about $5700 from Round 1.
*   **Bob's Value of $4000:** Since the inflation for Bob is 20%, his perceived value of $4000 now is equivalent to about $3200 from Round 1.

While I'm getting a larger share nominally, the actual value compared to Round 1 is less than it seems. Also, Bob is suffering greatly from the inflation.

I'm going to accept this offer. It is a reasonable split considering the inflation, and continuing could lead to a worse outcome for both of us with further rounds of inflation.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
