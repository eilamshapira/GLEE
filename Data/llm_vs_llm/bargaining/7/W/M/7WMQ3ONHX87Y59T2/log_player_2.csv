"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This seems reasonable as we both get the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think 60-40 is more suitable for me since the money loses value for me with each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you. Let's compromise - I'll take 45 and you get 55. This is fair considering the inflation only affects your side, and waiting longer will reduce the value for you even more. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
