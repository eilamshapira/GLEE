"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Current value of the offer for me (Bob): $4000
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The total pot will be worth 10% less to me
- And 20% less to Alice
- This gives me some negotiating leverage

The offer is a bit low (40% of the total), and since Alice will lose value faster than me in future rounds, I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%), I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight majority (55%)
2. For Alice, $4500 now is better than a similar or slightly higher amount in future rounds due to her 20% depreciation rate
3. It's not so extreme that it would likely trigger outright rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Current real value for me: $4500 * 0.81 = $3,645
Current real value for Alice: $5500 * 0.64 = $3,520

This offer is better than her first one, and the depreciation is starting to become significant. If I reject:
- Next round the money will be worth 28% less for me
- And 48% less for Alice
- The gap is widening, but we're also both losing value quickly

Since:
1. The split is more reasonable (45/55)
2. The real values are becoming significantly impacted
3. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate
4. Further delays will cost us both significantly
