Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, getting $100 is better than anything I could get in further rounds, as the value will only decrease."
