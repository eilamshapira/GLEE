"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
* If I get $5000 next round, it would only be worth $4500 to me
* The current offer of $4000 is a reasonable amount
* While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation risk makes this a decent offer
