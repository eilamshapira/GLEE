"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60/40. This is a good deal considering we only have 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% ($4000), keeping 60% ($6000)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to more rounds and more inflation
4. A 60/40 split isn't terrible, but it's not quite fair either
5. Given the inflation risk and multiple rounds could significantly reduce my gains, getting $4000 now might be better than trying to negotiate for more

However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even with 10% inflation. The split should be closer to 50/50.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that we both need to be reasonable to avoid multiple rounds of inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and we should agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
