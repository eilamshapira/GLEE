"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $100. Since I need to consider inflation reducing value by 5% each round, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial portion. With inflation affecting future rounds, it may be better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While I initially asked for more, this is a fair division, and due to inflation, my money would be worth less in future rounds. With inflation reducing my value by 5% each round, it's better to secure $50 now than risk getting less valuable money later or potentially nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds."
