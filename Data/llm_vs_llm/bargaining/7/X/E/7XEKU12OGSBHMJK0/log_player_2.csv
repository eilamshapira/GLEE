"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair offer, let's avoid inflation eating into our gains! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the total value for me will be worth 95% of current value
3. Next round maximum I could get (if Alice accepts) would be $950,000
4. But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 40% isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount, and the risk of inflation eating into future gains is significant. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation.
