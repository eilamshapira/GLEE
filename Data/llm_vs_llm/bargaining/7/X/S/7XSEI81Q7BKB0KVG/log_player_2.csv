"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is the fairest approach for both of us, where we each get exactly half. With a 50-50 split, neither of us is advantaged over the other."
