I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly and maximize my own gains. After all, inflation will hit my share harder with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm trying to secure a bigger share, but still offering Bob something to incentivize him to accept. With the inflation factor, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal."
