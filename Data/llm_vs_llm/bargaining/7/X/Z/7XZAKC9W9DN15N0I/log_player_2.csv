"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This offer is too low for me, as I would only get 10% of the total amount. Even with the 10% inflation risk, I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is a balanced and equitable solution that gives both of us a significant amount. Given that we're only in round 2, the inflation impact is still minimal, making this an attractive offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too low. Even with the 19% inflation penalty (meaning I'd effectively get $162,000), I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The inflation risk is increasing, but there's still room for negotiation as we're only in round 3 of 12."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the inflation risk I'm facing. Since I know my value is decreasing by 10% each round while Alice's inflation rate is unknown, this split helps balance the risk I'm taking. This is still a substantial amount for Alice, and given that we're a third through our rounds, it's time to move towards a resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the inflation is getting significant (I would effectively get only about $197,000 after the 34.39% inflation), this offer is still too low given the total sum. We're at round 5 of 12, so while the pressure is building, there's still time to negotiate a better deal. I'll make a more moderate proposal in the next round to try to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to a more moderate 55-45 split, slightly reducing my previous demand. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the mounting inflation pressure while still giving both of us a substantial amount. Given that we're halfway through our rounds and my money is losing value with each round, this offer balances the need for a fair split with the urgency to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 46.86% inflation penalty, I would effectively receive about $212,560, which is better than risking further rounds of inflation. Since we're more than halfway through our rounds (7 out of 12), and Alice has shown a pattern of gradually increasing her offers, this seems like a reasonable point to agree. The risk of continuing to negotiate and losing more value to inflation outweighs the potential benefits of holding out for a better offer."
