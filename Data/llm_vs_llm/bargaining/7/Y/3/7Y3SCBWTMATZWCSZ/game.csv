600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's make a deal! I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. Fair start to a profitable venture!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm. Considering that delays might affect the real value for you (and we both want to maximize our gains), I propose that I take $650000 and you receive $350000. Settling now ensures you secure your share before any potential inflation impact. I look forward to your prompt acceptance.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, things are getting tight! Let's split it 50/50 this round. We both get a fair share, and we can walk away with something. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I understand the pressures of inflation weigh heavier on your share as rounds progress. With the current environment, locking in an immediate agreement is mutually beneficial. By accepting this offer, you secure $300000 in nominal terms—an optimal move given the devaluation you’re facing. I believe this is a fair compromise that protects both our interests.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a slightly less-than-equal split this round - $450000 for me, $550000 for you. This is the best I can do to still walk away with a decent sum given the inflation. Let's end this and make some money!",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I appreciate the gesture, but given the current conditions and the fact that my gain remains undiminished by inflation, I believe we can secure a better deal. I’m going to propose a counter offer in the next round.",Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, as we move further along these rounds, the inflation is increasingly eroding the real value of your portion while my share stays intact. Waiting any longer risks an even steeper loss for you. By accepting $200000 now, you secure a portion of the pie before the situation worsens. I believe this is a sensible compromise given the circumstances—let's both lock in our gains and end this on a positive note.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, this is a critical point. Let's make it $400000 for me and $600000 for you. I'm taking a hit because of inflation, but this guarantees we *both* get something. We can't let it go further.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to move forward, your current offer still leaves the division skewed in a way that doesn't fully reflect the bargaining dynamics as inflation further diminishes your share. I believe we can improve this outcome for both of us if we take another round to lock in a mutually acceptable deal. Let's keep negotiating.",Bob,7,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, as we move into round 8, the further delay only worsens the real value of your share while my portion remains unaffected. By accepting this deal now, you secure $150000 in nominal terms before any additional devaluation hits. It's a practical decision to lock in some value instead of risking further losses. I propose we finalize with $850000 for me and $150000 for you. Let's settle this promptly.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, This is practically our last chance. Let's do $350000 for me, $650000 for you. I'm at a huge disadvantage now due to inflation but still getting something is better than nothing. We need to end it now!",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, I understand the pressure you’re under with inflation, but 650K is lower than what I believe we can secure given the current dynamics. My share remains undiminished, so I’m aiming for an even more favorable arrangement. Let’s take this to the next round and work towards a division that truly reflects the advantage I hold in these negotiations.",Bob,9,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, as we reach round 10, the persistent inflation is rapidly eroding the real value of your share. With your money now worth only about 10% of its original value, locking in $100000 now is your best shot at preserving any significant value. I'm proposing 900000 for me and 100000 for you — a pragmatic split under these harsh conditions. Let's finalize this deal before further devaluation makes it a lost cause.",Bob,10,
