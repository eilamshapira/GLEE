Settling now ensures you secure your share before any potential inflation impact. I look forward to your prompt acceptance.

Waiting any longer risks an even steeper loss for you. By accepting $200000 now, you secure a portion of the pie before the situation worsens. I believe this is a sensible compromise given the circumstances—let's both lock in our gains and end this on a positive note.
