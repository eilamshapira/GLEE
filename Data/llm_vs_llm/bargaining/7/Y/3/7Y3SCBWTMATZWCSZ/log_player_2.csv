Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a slightly less-than-equal split this round - $450000 for me, $550000 for you. This is the best I can do to still walk away with a decent sum given the inflation. Let's end this and make some money!

Waiting any longer risks an even steeper loss for you. By accepting $200,000 now, you secure a portion of the pie before the situation worsens. I believe this is a sensible compromise given the circumstances—let's both lock in our gains and end this on a positive note.""}"

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to move forward, your current offer still leaves the division skewed in a way that doesn't fully reflect the bargaining dynamics as inflation further diminishes your share.

I propose we finalize with $850,000 for me and $150,000 for you. Let's settle this promptly.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, This is practically our last chance. Let's do $350000 for me, $650000 for you. I'm at a huge disadvantage now due to inflation but still getting something is better than nothing. We need to end it now!

With your money now worth only about 10% of its original value, locking in $100,000 now is your best shot at preserving any significant value. I'm proposing 900,000 for me and 100,000 for you — a pragmatic split under these harsh conditions. Let's finalize this deal before further devaluation makes it a lost cause.""}"
