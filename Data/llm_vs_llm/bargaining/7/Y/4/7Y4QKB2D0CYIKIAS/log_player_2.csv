"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Current offer: $500,000 for me
If I reject and move to next round:
- Money is worth 5% less to me
- Maximum I could propose next round: $1,000,000 Ã— 0.95 = $950,000
- But Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation

Alice's offer of an even split is quite fair, and with inflation risk, taking a guaranteed $500,000 now is better than risking lower value in future rounds. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
