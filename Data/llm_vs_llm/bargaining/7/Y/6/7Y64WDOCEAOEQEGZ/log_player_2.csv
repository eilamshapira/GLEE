"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I get 60%, you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $60 while I get $40. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning my money will be worth less. However, I'd get to make the counter-offer.

Let me evaluate this: $40 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round but with a 5% reduction in value. If I reject, the maximum $100 would be worth $95 to me in the next round.
