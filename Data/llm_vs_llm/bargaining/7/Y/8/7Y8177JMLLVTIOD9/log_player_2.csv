"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair given the different constraints we face. If we keep going to later rounds, I'll get less value from the same dollar amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for Alice, while my value remains constant. Alice's offer is 45 for me and 55 for her. I have 12 rounds.

Let's think about this. If I reject, I become the proposer in round 2. Even if I propose 50/50, Alice will demand more to compensate for the inflation. If I reject now, I risk ending up with even less later, especially as inflation takes a larger toll on Alice.

Given the circumstances, 45 is a reasonable starting point. I'll accept.
