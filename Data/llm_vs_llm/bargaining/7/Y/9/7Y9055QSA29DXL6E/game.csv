600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split with $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Settling now avoids the inflation penalty in later rounds for me, and I hope you'll accept this fair offer. Let's secure our gains immediately.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I think your 60/40 split was a bit biased. Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob,

In order to avoid further inflation losses, I’m proposing a 50/50 split in nominal dollars this round. With me as the proposer in Round 3, my share is discounted by 20% (i.e. $500000 becomes effectively $400000) while your share, as offeree, is discounted by only 10% (i.e. $500000 effectively becomes $450000). I believe this offer is attractive given that it improves your effective payoff relative to your previous offer and helps us both secure a settlement before further rounds erode our gains. 

I hope you’ll agree that this balanced proposal is in our mutual best interest.",Alice,3,
