Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split with $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your 60/40 split was a bit biased. Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nIn order to avoid further inflation losses, I’m proposing a 50/50 split in nominal dollars this round. With me as the proposer in Round 3, my share is discounted by 20% (i.e. $500,000 becomes effectively $400,000) while your share, as offeree, is discounted by only 10% (i.e. $500,000 effectively becomes $450,000). I believe this offer is attractive given that it improves your effective payoff relative to your previous offer and helps us both secure a settlement before further rounds erode our gains. \n\nI hope you’ll agree that this balanced proposal is in our mutual best interest.""}"
