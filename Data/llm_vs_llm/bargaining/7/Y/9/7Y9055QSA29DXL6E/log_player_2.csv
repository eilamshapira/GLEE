"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split with $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Settling now avoids the inflation penalty in later rounds for me, and I hope you'll accept this fair offer. Let's secure our gains immediately.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your 60/40 split was a bit biased. Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

In order to avoid further inflation losses, I’m proposing a 50/50 split in nominal dollars this round. With me as the proposer in Round 3, my share is discounted by 20% (i.e. $500000 becomes effectively $400000) while your share, as offeree, is discounted by only 10% (i.e. $500000 effectively becomes $450000). I believe this offer is attractive given that it improves your effective payoff relative to your previous offer and helps us both secure a settlement before further rounds erode our gains. 

I hope you’ll agree that this balanced proposal is in our mutual best interest. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
