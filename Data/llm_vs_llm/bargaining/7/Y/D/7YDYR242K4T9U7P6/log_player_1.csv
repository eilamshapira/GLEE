"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, leaning slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and there's inflation risk if we go to further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable division that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests. If Bob rejects this offer, the total value will decrease by 5% in the next round, making it less favorable for both of us to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 5% inflation for me, if I accept, my $5500 is actually worth $5225
2. This is less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($5400)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 5% less
4. Bob's share is worth 10% less to him, suggesting he's more pressured by inflation than I am

Given that inflation is hurting Bob more than me (10% vs 5%), and I can make the next offer if I reject, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I know that inflation affects Bob more severely (10% per round) compared to my 5% per round, I can use this leverage. Bob should be more eager to reach an agreement to avoid higher inflation impact. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as Bob might still reject.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm increasing my share because:
1. Bob is experiencing higher inflation (10% per round)
2. If Bob rejects, his next offer will be affected by even more inflation
3. This offer, even with my 5% inflation penalty, would still give me more than the previous offers
4. It's still reasonable enough that Bob might accept to avoid further inflation losses"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With 14.26% inflation for me, if I accept, my $6200 is actually worth $5315.88
2. This is slightly better than what my $5500 would have been worth in round 2 ($5225)
3. Bob is suffering from 27.1% inflation, making his position significantly weaker
4. If I reject, we go to round 5, where:
   - My inflation will increase further
   - Bob's inflation will increase even more drastically
   - The total value for both of us will be lower

Given that:
- This offer gives me a better real value than previous rounds
- Both of us are losing value with each round
- Bob is suffering more from inflation than I am, but has still made a generous offer
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation

I will accept this offer.
