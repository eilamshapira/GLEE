"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $9,000 for me (10% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $4200 I would gain is worth approximately $3400 in the initial round's value (since it's 19% less). 

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me after 2 rounds of inflation (as calculated in the previous round for my gain, but now it's 3 rounds, so it's 10% more less: 10% + 10% + 10% = 27.1% less, approximately, for the value I gain, but I will use the exact 27.1% for calculations), after three rounds, it's worth approximately $7290 for me (10000 * (1 - 0.10)^3).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 3800, 
""alice_gain"": 6200} 

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more than the proportionally reduced amount, considering the inflation effect on my gain."
