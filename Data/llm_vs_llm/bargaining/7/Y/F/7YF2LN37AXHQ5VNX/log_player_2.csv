"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6000, you get $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5500 and you get $4500.  Time to make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better for me than the last one, even with inflation cutting into my potential earnings. It's worth seeing if I can get Alice to agree to a more even split in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This is a better deal for both of us, Alice. We're running out of time, and the pot is only getting smaller for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm giving you one last chance. $5100 for me, $4900 for you.  This is as generous as it gets! Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  While not ideal, anything less than $4900 in my favor is worth less than $4000 in round one due to inflation.  Alice is likely to stick to this offer, and I risk losing even more if I reject."
