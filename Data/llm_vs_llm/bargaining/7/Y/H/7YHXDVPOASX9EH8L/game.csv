5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, considering the 10% inflation affecting your gains, I'm offering you $4500 (worth $4050 to you) while I take $5500. This is actually a more balanced split than your previous offer when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize inflation impact.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, with the 27.1% inflation affecting your gains, your previous offer of $5200 was only worth $3791 to you. I'm now offering you $4800 (worth about $3499 to you) while I take $5200. This is actually more balanced than our previous offers when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further.",Alice,5,
