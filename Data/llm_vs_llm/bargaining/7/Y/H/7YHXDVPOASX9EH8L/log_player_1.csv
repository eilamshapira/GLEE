"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair proposition considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 55/45 split is more in line with a fair division considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money Bob gains is worth 10% less due to inflation, so his $5500 is actually worth $4950. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would be more beneficial for both of us."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, considering the 10% inflation affecting your gains, I'm offering you $4500 (worth $4050 to you) while I take $5500. This is actually a more balanced split than your previous offer when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a crucial round as inflation is eating into the value. I propose 52/48, acknowledging your previous offer but adjusting for the time pressure we both face.  Let's close this deal and walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Bob's $5200 is actually worth only about $3791 to him due to the 27.1% inflation, while my $4800 maintains its full value. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that accounts for this inflation effect more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, with the 27.1% inflation affecting your gains, your previous offer of $5200 was only worth $3791 to you. I'm now offering you $4800 (worth about $3499 to you) while I take $5200. This is actually more balanced than our previous offers when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and cut to the chase. I propose a 50/50 split. It's clean, fair, and avoids further losses due to inflation. Take this deal, and we both win. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While Bob's $5000 is worth only about $2952 to him due to the 40.95% inflation, continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for both of us. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and the inflation penalty on Bob's side will keep increasing. This is a reasonable compromise at this point."
