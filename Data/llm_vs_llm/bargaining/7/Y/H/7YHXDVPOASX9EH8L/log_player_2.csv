Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair proposition considering we both need to reach an agreement.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the 10% inflation affecting your gains, I'm offering you $4500 (worth $4050 to you) while I take $5500. This is actually a more balanced split than your previous offer when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize inflation impact.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with the 27.1% inflation affecting your gains, your previous offer of $5200 was only worth $3791 to you. I'm now offering you $4800 (worth about $3499 to you) while I take $5200. This is actually more balanced than our previous offers when accounting for inflation. Let's reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's getting close. Alice is clearly using the inflation against me, but I believe I can still secure a slightly better deal. The closer we get to the deadline, the more pressure is on both of us."
