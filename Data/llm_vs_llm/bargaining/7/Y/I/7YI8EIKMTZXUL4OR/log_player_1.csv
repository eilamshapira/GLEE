"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we have different inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you). If we continue to round 3, the total value decreases for both of us. This 55-45 split actually benefits both of us more than continuing to negotiate, considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
