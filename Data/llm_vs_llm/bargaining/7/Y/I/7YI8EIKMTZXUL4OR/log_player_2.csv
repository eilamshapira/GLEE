"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) while taking $6,000 (60%) for herself. This is not an equal 50-50 split.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty on my end. This means in the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me, and I'd need to make a counterproposal.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice), and that I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, I'll decline this initial offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that accounts for the inflation rates and tries to find a fair middle ground.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand we have different inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you). If we continue to round 3, the total value decreases for both of us. This 55-45 split actually benefits both of us more than continuing to negotiate, considering our different inflation rates.""}"
