,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, let's avoid any potential downsides from future rounds. I’m proposing we settle now: I get $8000 and you get $2000. This way, you secure a definite sum rather than risking uncertainty later. I hope you agree to a swift resolution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, you're trying to take advantage of the inflation! Let's split this fairly.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, I know you’re aiming for fairness, but the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of any money you receive. If we delay further, your share will diminish even more, and when you get to propose next, I’ll still have all the negotiating power. To avoid a painful erosion of your gains, I’m offering you $100 now. Though it may seem small, any delay will leave you with even less in effective value. Let’s settle this immediately.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, you're playing a dangerous game. While inflation is a factor, I'm not going to be bullied into taking pennies on the dollar.  This is my final offer: 30% for me, 70% for you. It's a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Alice, I know you’ve been insisting on a fair share, but with each passing round the inflation eats away at your amount. If we push this further, your effective gains will shrink dramatically – far below what I’m offering now. I’m proposing $500 for you and $9500 for me. This isn’t a slight at your fairness; it’s a rational offer to secure the best effective outcome for you before the next round’s further devaluation. Let’s settle now and avoid unnecessary losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Bob, you're pushing your luck.  I'm not going to accept a pittance just to avoid another round of inflation.  I'm offering 10% for myself, 90% for you. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1050.0,8950.0,"Alice, here's my proposal for round 8: I'll take $8950 and you get $1050. I know the numbers may seem lopsided, but remember that every additional round further erodes the real value of the money you receive—in fact, as of round 7 your share was already discounted by about 46.86%, and if we continue, that penalty will only worsen. By accepting this offer, you lock in an effective value of roughly $1050 × 0.5314 ≈ $557 for you. If you push for another round, your real gains will drop even further. I believe this is the best outcome you can secure under the circumstances. Let's settle now.",Bob,8,
