Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid any potential downsides from future rounds. I’m proposing we settle now: I get $8000 and you get $2000. This way, you secure a definite sum rather than risking uncertainty later. I hope you agree to a swift resolution. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re aiming for fairness, but the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of any money you receive. If we delay further, your share will diminish even more, and when you get to propose next, I’ll still have all the negotiating power. To avoid a painful erosion of your gains, I’m offering you $100 now. Though it may seem small, any delay will leave you with even less in effective value. Let’s settle this immediately. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’ve been insisting on a fair share, but with each passing round the inflation eats away at your amount. If we push this further, your effective gains will shrink dramatically – far below what I’m offering now. I’m proposing $500 for you and $9500 for me. This isn’t a slight at your fairness; it’s a rational offer to secure the best effective outcome for you before the next round’s further devaluation. Let’s settle now and avoid unnecessary losses.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's my proposal for round 8: I'll take $8950 and you get $1050. I know the numbers may seem lopsided, but remember that every additional round further erodes the real value of the money you receive—in fact, as of round 7 your share was already discounted by about 46.86%, and if we continue, that penalty will only worsen. By accepting this offer, you lock in an effective value of roughly $1050 × 0.5314 ≈ $557 for you. If you push for another round, your real gains will drop even further. I believe this is the best outcome you can secure under the circumstances. Let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 1050 
# Bob gain: 8950
