If we delay further, your share will diminish even more, and when you get to propose next, I’ll still have all the negotiating power. To avoid a painful erosion of your gains, I’m offering you $100 now. Though it may seem small, any delay will leave you with even less in effective value. Let’s settle this immediately.""}"

# Alice's message: Bob, you're playing a dangerous game. While inflation is a factor, I'm not going to be bullied into taking pennies on the dollar.  This is my final offer: 30% for me, 70% for you. It's a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's end this now.

If we push this further, your effective gains will shrink dramatically – far below what I’m offering now. I’m proposing $500 for you and $9500 for me. This isn’t a slight at your fairness; it’s a rational offer to secure the best effective outcome for you before the next round’s further devaluation. Let’s settle now and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8950, ""alice_gain"": 1050, ""message"": ""Alice, here's my proposal for round 8: I'll take $8,950 and you get $1,050. I know the numbers may seem lopsided, but remember that every additional round further erodes the real value of the money you receive—in fact, as of round 7 your share was already discounted by about 46.86%, and if we continue, that penalty will only worsen. By accepting this offer, you lock in an effective value of roughly $1,050 × 0.5314 ≈ $557 for you. If you push for another round, your real gains will drop even further. I believe this is the best outcome you can secure under the circumstances. Let's settle now.""}"
