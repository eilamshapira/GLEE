"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll act as Alice in this bargaining game. Given the inflation penalty of 20% per round for me, I have an incentive to reach an agreement early.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a fair split with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first move. This gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to avoid the inflation penalty. A quick agreement benefits us both, as further negotiation would decrease the total value I can receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While this gives me less than my initial proposal, the 20% inflation penalty makes this a reasonable choice. If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount I might receive would be worth significantly less to me due to compounding inflation. With this agreement, I secure $450,000 which is better than risking further devaluation through continued negotiation."
