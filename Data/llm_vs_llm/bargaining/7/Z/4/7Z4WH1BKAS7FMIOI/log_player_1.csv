"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable proposal that accounts for the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering I'll lose 20% value each round if we delay, and we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept now, I'll get $50 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I'm getting $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less. Given that we have a limited number of rounds and the value keeps decreasing, accepting $40 worth now is better than risking further devaluation.
