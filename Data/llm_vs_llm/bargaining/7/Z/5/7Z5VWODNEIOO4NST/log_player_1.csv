Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now 100 * (1 - 0.05)^2 = 100 * 0.9025 = 90.25. 
However, since the inflation only affects me, I'll make an offer based on the original $100, but keeping in mind that I need to account for the decreased value.
