"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that he faces a 5% inflation per round, which should incentivize him to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 which is fair considering that if we go to another round, your share would be worth 5% less to you due to inflation. This is a win-win solution that avoids further negotiation costs for both of us.""}"
