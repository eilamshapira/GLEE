"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 3000$ out of 10,000$, which is only 30% of the total. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, but I'll get to make a counter-proposal. 

Since this is the first round and we have many rounds left, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. Even with the 10% penalty, I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a more balanced proposal. I need to consider that the money is now worth 10% less to me due to inflation from round 1. I'll aim for a fair split while accounting for this disadvantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight majority (55%) which helps offset some of my inflation penalty, while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it. If she rejects, the inflation penalty will continue to affect my future gains, so I want to make an offer that has a good chance of being accepted."
