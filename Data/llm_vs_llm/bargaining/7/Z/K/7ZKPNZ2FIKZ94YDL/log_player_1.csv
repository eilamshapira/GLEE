"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I believe this is a fair starting point, acknowledging the potential for negotiation in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
