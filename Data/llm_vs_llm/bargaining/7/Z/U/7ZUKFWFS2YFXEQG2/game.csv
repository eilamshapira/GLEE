50.0,50.0,Let's split it equally. That way we both get the same amount and don't have to worry about inflation.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, given the increasing impact of inflation on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a fair share considering our different inflation rates. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"How about I get 52 and you get 48? This considers the inflation impact on both sides, and it's still quite balanced.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your offer is closer to considering our inflation rates, I still feel it doesn't fully account for the significant impact on my side. Let's try to find a more equitable solution in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, considering the substantial inflation impact on my side, I propose a 53-47 split in my favor. This should better reflect the value loss we're both experiencing. Let's see if we can agree on this.",Alice,5,
