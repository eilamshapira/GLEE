"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an equal split, it's a significant amount. 

Given that:
1. I know inflation doesn't affect my value (0% loss per round)
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. But Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that prolonging the game might lead to worse outcomes if Alice becomes more aggressive in negotiations. 4000$ is a reasonable offer, though not ideal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I'll propose a more balanced division, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance. A 45-55 split seems reasonable and fair, while being more favorable to me than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more equitable than the previous 40-60 split
2. By giving Alice slightly more (55%), it shows willingness to compromise
3. It's a significant improvement for me (+500$) compared to the previous offer
4. The offer is reasonable enough that rejecting it might make Alice appear too greedy"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting development! Alice has now offered me exactly what I proposed in the previous round (4500$), but there's an important difference: her 5500$ is now worth 19% less to her due to inflation.

Let's analyze:
1. For me: 4500$ (same value as before)
2. For Alice: 5500$ but worth only 4455$ (5500 * 0.81) in round 1 terms

This is actually a better relative position than my previous proposal, because while I get the same amount, Alice's portion has effectively decreased in value. Since:
1. I'm being offered a fair amount (4500$)
2. The inflation is making Alice more likely to want to conclude quickly
3. Further rounds might lead to more complex negotiations
4. This matches what I previously thought was fair
