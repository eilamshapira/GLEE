"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly. 55 for me, 45 for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is the first round and any delay means a 20% reduction in the value of the money for me, I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. While not exactly equal, this is a reasonable first offer. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value for me would decrease by 20%, meaning even if I proposed a better split, the maximum I could get would be $80 (the remaining value to me), and Alice could still reject that.

Since $45 now is better than potentially less in future rounds due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
