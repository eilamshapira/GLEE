"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss from inflation in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a slightly better split for me to compensate for the risk of future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $480,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $432,000 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- Even if I managed to get a larger share in the next round, the inflation penalty might make it worth less than accepting now
- Bob's offer is relatively fair, giving me 48% of the total
