3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your proactive approach. To avoid the risks and uncertainties that come with additional rounds, I propose we settle now: I take $7000 and you get $3000. I believe this quick resolution benefits us both. Please consider this offer as a fair way to secure our share immediately.",Bob,2,

8000.0,2000.0,"I understand your desire for a quick resolution, Bob, but your offer was too unbalanced.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than that to make this worthwhile.",Alice,3,

8100.0,1900.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a more attractive share. However, given that each round further erodes the value of your portion, delaying might not work in your favor. To settle matters now, I propose a division where you receive $8100 nominally (worth roughly $7310 in current value) and I receive $1900. This offer improves upon the previous terms for you and avoids the risk of further devaluation. I hope we can agree on this pragmatic solution and end the game on a positive note.",Bob,4,
