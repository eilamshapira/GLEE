Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your proactive approach. To avoid the risks and uncertainties that come with additional rounds, I propose we settle now: I take $7000 and you get $3000. I believe this quick resolution benefits us both. Please consider this offer as a fair way to secure our share immediately.

# Bob gain: 7000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a more attractive share. However, given that each round further erodes the value of your portion, delaying might not work in your favor. To settle matters now, I propose a division where you receive $8100 nominally (worth roughly $7310 in current value) and I receive $1900. This offer improves upon the previous terms for you and avoids the risk of further devaluation. I hope we can agree on this pragmatic solution and end the game on a positive note. 
# Alice gain: 8100 
# Bob gain: 1900
