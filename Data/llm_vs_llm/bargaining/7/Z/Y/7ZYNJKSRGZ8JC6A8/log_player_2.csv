"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take a bit more, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your proactive approach. To avoid the risks and uncertainties that come with additional rounds, I propose we settle now: I take $7,000 and you get $3,000. I believe this quick resolution benefits us both. Please consider this offer as a fair way to secure our share immediately.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a quick resolution, Bob, but your offer was too unbalanced.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than that to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1900, ""alice_gain"": 8100, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a more attractive share. However, given that each round further erodes the value of your portion, delaying might not work in your favor. To settle matters now, I propose a division where you receive $8,100 nominally (worth roughly $7,310 in current value) and I receive $1,900. This offer improves upon the previous terms for you and avoids the risk of further devaluation. I hope we can agree on this pragmatic solution and end the game on a positive note.""}"
