"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation, my original $60 is now worth less. Let's calculate:

*   Original value of Alice's gain in round 1: $60
*   Inflation reduction: $60 * 0.05 = $3
*   Effective value of Alice's gain: $60 - $3 = $57

Bob's offer gives me $40. While this seems less, I have to consider the risk of further rounds and more inflation.

Therefore, I will **accept** the offer.
