"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Sorry Alice, I need a bit more. How about I take $55 and you take $45? Let's not forget about the inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation, but a 55/45 split is still too uneven.  Let's compromise on 52/48. That's a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 54, ""alice_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""How about I take $54 and you take $46? We're running out of rounds, Alice. Consider the inflation.""}

Just to be clear, the actual values for me are now 90.25% of the original value (or 90.25$ if we consider the absolute value, due to the 9.75% inflation). Also, the actual values for Alice are now 81% of the original (or 81$ if we consider the absolute value, due to the 19% inflation)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round. 48/52 seems like a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
