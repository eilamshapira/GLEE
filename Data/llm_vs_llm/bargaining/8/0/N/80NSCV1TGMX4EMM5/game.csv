800000.0,200000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a split where I get $800000 and you get $200000. Since the money loses 20% of its value for you each round, if we continue to Round 2, our $1M will effectively be worth only $800000 to you. By accepting now, you get $200000 immediately, which is 25% of what the full amount would be worth to you next round. This is a fair division considering the depreciation you face.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about depreciation, but your initial offer was too uneven. This is a much fairer split - you still get the majority ($550K), acknowledging that I face depreciation pressure, but it's more balanced than your 80-20 proposal. If you reject this, we'll go to round 3 where the total will be worth only $640K to me, and your potential gain could be much lower. This is a win-win offer.",Bob,2,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's consider the reality of our situation. The money is now worth only 64% of its original value to you due to the 20% depreciation per round. If you reject this offer and we go to round 4, the money will be worth just 51.2% to you. My offer of $250000 to you now is actually quite generous - it's 39% of what the full million is currently worth to you ($640000). This is a fair compromise from my initial position, recognizing we both want to conclude this efficiently.",Alice,3,
