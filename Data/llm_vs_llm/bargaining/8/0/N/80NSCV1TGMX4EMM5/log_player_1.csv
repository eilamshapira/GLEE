"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a split where I get $800,000 and you get $200,000. Since the money loses 20% of its value for you each round, if we continue to Round 2, our $1M will effectively be worth only $800,000 to you. By accepting now, you get $200,000 immediately, which is 25% of what the full amount would be worth to you next round. This is a fair division considering the depreciation you face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about depreciation, but your initial offer was too uneven. This is a much fairer split - you still get the majority ($550K), acknowledging that I face depreciation pressure, but it's more balanced than your 80-20 proposal. If you reject this, we'll go to round 3 where the total will be worth only $640K to me, and your potential gain could be much lower. This is a win-win offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's consider the reality of our situation. The money is now worth only 64% of its original value to you due to the 20% depreciation per round. If you reject this offer and we go to round 4, the money will be worth just 51.2% to you. My offer of $250,000 to you now is actually quite generous - it's 39% of what the full million is currently worth to you ($640,000). This is a fair compromise from my initial position, recognizing we both want to conclude this efficiently.""}"
