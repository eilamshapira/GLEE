"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a split where I get $800000 and you get $200000. Since the money loses 20% of its value for you each round, if we continue to Round 2, our $1M will effectively be worth only $800000 to you. By accepting now, you get $200000 immediately, which is 25% of what the full amount would be worth to you next round. This is a fair division considering the depreciation you face. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, we go to Round 2 where:
- The total $1M is worth only $800K to me due to 20% depreciation
- I can make the next offer
- But Alice knows I'm under pressure due to depreciation

2. Alice's current offer gives me $200K:
- This is indeed 25% of what the total would be worth to me next round ($800K)
- However, it seems like Alice is trying to use the depreciation factor to push for a very uneven split

3. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer:
- Even with depreciation, I should be able to propose a more balanced split
- Alice has no depreciation pressure, but she still needs my agreement to get anything

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer, considering both the depreciation factor and the need for a more equitable split:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about depreciation, but your initial offer was too uneven. This is a much fairer split - you still get the majority ($550K), acknowledging that I face depreciation pressure, but it's more balanced than your 80-20 proposal. If you reject this, we'll go to round 3 where the total will be worth only $640K to me, and your potential gain could be much lower. This is a win-win offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's consider the reality of our situation. The money is now worth only 64% of its original value to you due to the 20% depreciation per round. If you reject this offer and we go to round 4, the money will be worth just 51.2% to you. My offer of $250000 to you now is actually quite generous - it's 39% of what the full million is currently worth to you ($640000). This is a fair compromise from my initial position, recognizing we both want to conclude this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current state:
- The $1M is now worth only $640K to me due to 36% depreciation
- Alice's offer gives me $250K (which is worth $250K)
- If I reject, next round the $1M will be worth only $512K to me

2. Alice's offer of $250K:
- This is indeed 39% of what the total is worth to me now ($640K)
- It's better than her initial offer of $200K
- She's showing some movement toward compromise

3. If I reject:
- I can make another offer, but my negotiating position is getting weaker
- The continued depreciation significantly reduces my leverage
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer next round

Given the deteriorating value and Alice's modest improvement in the offer, accepting now is better than risking further depreciation:
