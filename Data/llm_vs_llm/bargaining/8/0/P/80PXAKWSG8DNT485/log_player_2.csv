"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I accept Alice's offer now, I get $5,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 to me). Even if I were to get all $10,000 in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice would probably reject), it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Since $5,000 now is better than a maximum potential of $8,000 in the next round (which would require Alice to accept an extremely unfavorable offer), I should accept this fair split.
