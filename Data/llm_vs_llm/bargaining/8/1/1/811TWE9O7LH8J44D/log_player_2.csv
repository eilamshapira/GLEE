"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $45 while she takes $55. 
If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me.

Given this significant inflation penalty for me, getting $45 now is better than having the chance to divide $80 (my effective value) in the next round.
