"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is beneficial for both of us, and we avoid losing value due to inflation in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 55-45 split in her favor.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but both our money values decrease (10% for me, 5% for Alice). This means the $100 would be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice in round 2.

If I counter-offer something like 50-50 or better for me in round 2, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation. Since my money devalues faster than Alice's, prolonged negotiation disadvantages me more.

A 45% share now is better than potentially less after several rounds of inflation. This seems like a reasonable first offer considering our different inflation rates.
