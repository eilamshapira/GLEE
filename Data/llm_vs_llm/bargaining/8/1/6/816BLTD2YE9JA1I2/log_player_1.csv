"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob.

Given that there's inflation affecting Bob's value (10% less each round) but not affecting my value, I should consider that Bob might be more willing to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and gives both of us an equal share of the money."
