"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to make it attractive for acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose that Bob gets $520,000 and I get $480,000. This is a fair and generous split that gives Bob a slight advantage, which should make it appealing to accept rather than moving to the next round."
