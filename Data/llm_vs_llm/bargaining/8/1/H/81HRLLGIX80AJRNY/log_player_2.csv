Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Taking Alice's offer would mean accepting significantly less than I would have gotten in the first round due to inflation.  I need to try and push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 

This is my final offer. While I understand the money is worth less to me than it was initially, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option."
