"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer gives me $100,000, I believe we can reach a fairer division considering the inflation constraint I face.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division to account for the time pressure I face due to the 20% inflation penalty. Since my money loses value each round while yours doesn't, a more equitable split would give me a larger portion now. This arrangement still provides you with a substantial amount while recognizing the asymmetric inflation penalties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that we're now in round 3 with a 36% inflation penalty for me, this offer is reasonable. Alice has significantly improved her offer from the initial $100,000 to $400,000, which shows good faith negotiation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
