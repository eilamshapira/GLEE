9999.0,1.0,"Bob, if you reject this offer you’ll end up proposing in the next round—but given the 20% inflation penalty you face, you’d have to offer me nearly everything to get my approval. Accept $1 now rather than waiting for a future where you end up with nothing. Please accept this division.",Alice,1,

3333.0,6667.0,"Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 40%, so if you get X dollars now, you effectively get 0.6X. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where your money is worth only 40% of its nominal value, and you'll end up with nearly all of the $10000—but that only amounts to about $4000 in effective value. To make you at least as well off as your fallback, I need to offer you 6667 dollars (since 6667 × 0.6 ≈ 4000), leaving me with 3333 dollars. Please accept this division to maximize our outcomes under inflation.",Alice,3,
