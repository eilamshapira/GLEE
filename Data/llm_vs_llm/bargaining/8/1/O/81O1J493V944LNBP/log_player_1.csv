"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, if you reject this offer you’ll end up proposing in the next round—but given the 20% inflation penalty you face, you’d have to offer me nearly everything to get my approval. Accept $1 now rather than waiting for a future where you end up with nothing. Please accept this division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your strategy, but given the inflation penalty I face, I need to secure more for myself in this round. It's your turn to accept a smaller share to avoid prolonging the game. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3333, ""bob_gain"": 6667, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 40%, so if you get X dollars now, you effectively get 0.6X. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where your money is worth only 40% of its nominal value, and you'll end up with nearly all of the $10,000—but that only amounts to about $4,000 in effective value. To make you at least as well off as your fallback, I need to offer you 6667 dollars (since 6667 × 0.6 ≈ 4000), leaving me with 3333 dollars. Please accept this division to maximize our outcomes under inflation.""}"
