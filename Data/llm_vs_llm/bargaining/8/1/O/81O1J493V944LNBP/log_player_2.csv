"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, if you reject this offer you’ll end up proposing in the next round—but given the 20% inflation penalty you face, you’d have to offer me nearly everything to get my approval. Accept $1 now rather than waiting for a future where you end up with nothing. Please accept this division. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your strategy, but given the inflation penalty I face, I need to secure more for myself in this round. It's your turn to accept a smaller share to avoid prolonging the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, in round 3 your share is discounted by 40%, so if you get X dollars now, you effectively get 0.6X. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where your money is worth only 40% of its nominal value, and you'll end up with nearly all of the $10000—but that only amounts to about $4000 in effective value. To make you at least as well off as your fallback, I need to offer you 6667 dollars (since 6667 × 0.6 ≈ 4000), leaving me with 3333 dollars. Please accept this division to maximize our outcomes under inflation. 
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333
