"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $40 of the $100 pot, keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money will be worth 10% less to me
- The total $100 will effectively be worth $90 to me
- I'll get to make the next proposal
- But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

$40 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation. While the split isn't entirely equal, it's a reasonable offer considering I'd lose value in future rounds.
