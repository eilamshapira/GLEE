"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally at 50-50, so we both benefit equally from this deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and since there's inflation affecting Bob's gains in future rounds, it's better to accept now rather than risk getting a worse deal later. This way we both get a reasonable share without further delay."
