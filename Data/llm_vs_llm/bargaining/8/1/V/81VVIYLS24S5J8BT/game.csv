600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor because my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than yours (5%). This division accounts for our different time pressures while still giving you a substantial portion. If we delay, I lose more value quickly, but we both benefit from agreeing now.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value for you, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging your higher inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,

540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, I understand we need to compromise. Since we're now in round 3, my money has already lost 36% of its original value while yours has only lost about 10%. This 54/46 split is fair considering our drastically different inflation rates. If we go another round, I'll lose another 20% while you only lose 5%. This is a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges both our positions.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. This adjustment from my last offer reflects our need to reach an agreement soon, considering your money is now worth 36% less than at the start. Let's finalize this to prevent further loss.",Bob,4,
