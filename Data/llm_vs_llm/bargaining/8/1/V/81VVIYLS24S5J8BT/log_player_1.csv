"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $1,000,000 with a fair consideration of our different inflation rates.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor because my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than yours (5%). This division accounts for our different time pressures while still giving you a substantial portion. If we delay, I lose more value quickly, but we both benefit from agreeing now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value for you, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging your higher inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for our current situation and the increasing inflation pressure.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand we need to compromise. Since we're now in round 3, my money has already lost 36% of its original value while yours has only lost about 10%. This 54/46 split is fair considering our drastically different inflation rates. If we go another round, I'll lose another 20% while you only lose 5%. This is a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges both our positions.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. This adjustment from my last offer reflects our need to reach an agreement soon, considering your money is now worth 36% less than at the start. Let's finalize this to prevent further loss. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
