"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor because my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than yours (5%). This division accounts for our different time pressures while still giving you a substantial portion. If we delay, I lose more value quickly, but we both benefit from agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we need to compromise. Since we're now in round 3, my money has already lost 36% of its original value while yours has only lost about 10%. This 54/46 split is fair considering our drastically different inflation rates. If we go another round, I'll lose another 20% while you only lose 5%. This is a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000

This adjustment from my last offer reflects our need to reach an agreement soon, considering your money is now worth 36% less than at the start. Let's finalize this to prevent further loss.""
