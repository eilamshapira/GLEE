"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
* My $50 is actually worth $47.50 (50 * 0.95) to me
* Bob's $50 is worth full value to him

While this isn't ideal, rejecting means moving to round 3 where my money will be worth even less (90.25% of original value). Bob seems to be playing fairly with a 50-50 split, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later with compounding inflation affecting my share.
