"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
2. 4000$ now is worth more than 4400$ next round due to the 10% inflation
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she might be more or less willing to accept future offers
4. We have a limited number of rounds (12) before we both get nothing

Given these factors, while the offer isn't ideal, I think it's reasonable enough to accept rather than risk losing value to inflation and potential future rejections.
