Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money ($999,000), while Bob only gets $1,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
