5000.0,5000.0,"I'm proposing an equal split which is fair to both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delaying will reduce the value of my share. Let's agree to this fair division and both walk away with $5000.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I understand the concerns about inflation, but I believe my contributions to our partnership deserve a slightly larger share. This offer still gives you a significant sum.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,I notice inflation is affecting you more severely at 20% per round compared to my 10%. This means delaying further is worse for you than for me. This adjusted split acknowledges our different inflation pressures while still being fair. Let's close this deal now before both our shares lose more value.,Alice,3,
