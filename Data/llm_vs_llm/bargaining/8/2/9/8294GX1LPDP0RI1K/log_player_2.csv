"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal split which is fair to both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delaying will reduce the value of my share. Let's agree to this fair division and both walk away with $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand the concerns about inflation, but I believe my contributions to our partnership deserve a slightly larger share. This offer still gives you a significant sum.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I notice inflation is affecting you more severely at 20% per round compared to my 10%. This means delaying further is worse for you than for me. This adjusted split acknowledges our different inflation pressures while still being fair. Let's close this deal now before both our shares lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to exploit my higher inflation rate, but her offer is still not good enough.  While waiting is riskier for me, I need to hold out for a better deal for a couple more rounds.  It's clear waiting hurts her too, even if it's at a slower pace."

Round 4
