"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a moderate advantage while still offering Bob a substantial sum that would be hard to reject. If Bob refuses, they'll get to make the next offer, but they'll need to consider that I could then reject their offer, leading to further rounds and potential delays in receiving any money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This split is too unfavorable for me. Bob is trying to take a much larger share (70%) while offering me only 30%. Since we started with a more balanced proposal, I'll reject this and make a more equitable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly more favorable than my first offer since Bob showed they're willing to make aggressive proposals:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm increasing my requested share to show Bob that aggressive offers will lead to counter-proposals that are less favorable to them, while still keeping the split reasonable enough that it might be accepted to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too imbalanced, although Bob has moved slightly from their previous 70-30 split to a 65-35 split. However, it's still not fair enough to accept. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round, but we need to move towards a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a fair position:

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing a more moderate 52.5/47.5 split, moving from my previous more aggressive position. This shows good faith in trying to reach a fair agreement while still maintaining a slight advantage. The split is now very close to equal, and rejecting this would signal that Bob isn't interested in a fair resolution."
