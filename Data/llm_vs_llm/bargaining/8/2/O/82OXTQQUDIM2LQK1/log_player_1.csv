"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since money loses value for me each round, it's better for both of us to agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. Accept now before it's worth even less to you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
* Even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $48 to me
* The risk of further negotiation and value loss is significant
* Bob's offer, while not ideal, gives me a guaranteed $40.5 in effective value
