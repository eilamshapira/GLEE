"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting Alice (me) and Bob. Since I lose value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should aim for a fair but slightly favorable initial split.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. If Bob declines, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round, but especially for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to inflation:
- For me (Alice), $4000 is now worth $3600 (10% less)
- For Bob, $6000 is now worth $5700 (5% less)

2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
- Further inflation will reduce values (another 10% for me, 5% for Bob)
- I could make a new offer, but Bob might reject again
- We're already in round 2 of 12, but time pressure isn't severe yet

3. The current offer gives Bob a significant advantage ($5700 effective value for him vs $3600 effective value for me)

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're in round 3:
1. My money is worth 20% less than round 1
2. Bob's money is worth 10% less than round 1
3. My previous offer of 5500/4500 was rejected
4. Bob's offer of 4000/6000 showed his expectations

I'll make a more compromising offer, but still better than what Bob offered:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This offer is more balanced than Bob's previous offer while accounting for our different inflation rates. For Bob, this means $5200 at 10% inflation = $4680 effective value, which is still quite good. For me, $4800 at 20% inflation = $3840 effective value. This is better than his previous offer to me and might be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current effective values due to inflation:
- For me (Alice): $4200 × (1 - 0.271) = $3062
- For Bob: $5800 × (1 - 0.1426) = $4973

2. Considerations:
- We're in round 4 of 12, so there's still time but inflation is becoming significant
- Bob has slightly improved his offer from last time ($4200 vs $4000)
- My last offer was rejected, suggesting Bob is firm on wanting more than 50%
- Inflation is accelerating (10% per round for me, 5% for Bob)
- If I reject, next round my money will be worth about 34.4% less

3. Decision:
While this isn't ideal, the inflation is making each round more costly for me than for Bob. If we continue negotiating, my negotiating position weakens faster than Bob's. The offer has improved and further delays might result in worse outcomes for me.
