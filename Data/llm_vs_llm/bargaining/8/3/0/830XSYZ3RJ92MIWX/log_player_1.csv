"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to settle early than risk the negotiation dragging on.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to settle early. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offered me $45, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $55, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $49.5 to him
3. This offer is worse for me than my initial proposal
4. However, if I reject, we'll move to round 3 with more inflation for Bob
5. I still have leverage to make another offer if I reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains, it's in your best interest to accept this 55-45 split. This is a fair compromise from my initial offer, and delaying further will only decrease the real value you'll receive.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can find a better balance. Considering the inflation affecting my gains, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Let's settle on 52-48. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $48, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $52, but with 27.1% inflation, it's actually worth about $37.91 to him
3. His offer has improved from his last one ($45)
4. However, inflation is significantly impacting his position, making my bargaining position stronger
5. I can likely get a better deal by making another offer, as the inflation pressure on Bob is increasing

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about our situation. With the significant inflation affecting your gains, this 58-42 split actually gives you about $30.6 in real value. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce your real gains even further. This is the best time to accept and maximize your actual value.""}"
