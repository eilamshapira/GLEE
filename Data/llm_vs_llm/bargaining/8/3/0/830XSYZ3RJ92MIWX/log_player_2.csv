Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains, it's in your best interest to accept this 55-45 split. This is a fair compromise from my initial offer, and delaying further will only decrease the real value you'll receive.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic about our situation. With the significant inflation affecting your gains, this 58-42 split actually gives you about $30.6 in real value. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce your real gains even further. This is the best time to accept and maximize your actual value. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
