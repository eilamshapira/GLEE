"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I understand that I need to make a fair offer, considering that:
1. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for him in the next round
2. Bob can counter-offer in the next round if he rejects
3. The total must sum to $1,000,000

Given these factors, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This gives me a reasonable advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should consider accepting rather than moving to a round where the money is worth less for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, if I accept:
   * My $400,000 is actually worth $320,000 (400000 * 0.8)

2. If I reject and propose in the next round:
   * The money will be worth another 20% less for me
   * I could propose a higher amount, but it would be worth even less
   * Bob would also face additional 10% inflation

Given that Bob's offer would give me an effective value of $320,000, and rejecting would lead to further value decay, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
