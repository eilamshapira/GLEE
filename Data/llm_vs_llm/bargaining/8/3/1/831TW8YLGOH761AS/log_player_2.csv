Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me is now 1,000,000 * 0.9 = 900,000
The value of the money for Alice is now 1,000,000 * 0.8 = 800,000

I'll make an offer that is more favorable to me.
