40.0,60.0,"Alice, every round we delay costs you more due to inflation. In Round 2, youâ€™d get 40 with a 10% discount, effectively $36, while I get 60 at only a 5% discount, about $57. By accepting now you avoid an even steeper loss in later rounds. Let's settle this now for the best outcome for both of us.",Bob,2,
