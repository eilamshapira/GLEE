"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay costs you more due to inflation. In Round 2, youâ€™d get 40 with a 10% discount, effectively $36, while I get 60 at only a 5% discount, about $57. By accepting now you avoid an even steeper loss in later rounds. Let's settle this now for the best outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
