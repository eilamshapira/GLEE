Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is shortchanged and we both walk away with a fair share. It's a win-win situation. If we keep going it's just going to hurt both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
