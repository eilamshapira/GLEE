"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal to Bob, keeping in mind the potential for inflation affecting my gains with each rejected round. In the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still offer Bob a significant amount to incentivize acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Considering the 5% inflation hit I've already taken, accepting this offer guarantees me $500,000, which is worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1. I need to decide if that's better than risking further inflation and potentially receiving less in future rounds. I'll accept the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
