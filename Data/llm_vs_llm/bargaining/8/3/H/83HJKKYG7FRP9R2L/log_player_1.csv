Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 51-49 split in my favor. It's a fairer division, and we can avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. The 49$ I'll receive now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds due to the 5% inflation per round
2. The split is quite fair, nearly 50-50
3. There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer from me in the next round
4. Prolonging the negotiation is risky as we only have 12 rounds total"
