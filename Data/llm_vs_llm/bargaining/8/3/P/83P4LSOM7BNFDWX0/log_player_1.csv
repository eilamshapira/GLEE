"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer that's fair but also accounts for the asymmetric inflation rates that affect us differently.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 Bob, which is a substantial portion of the money. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5%, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly, which benefits us both. This is a fair split that acknowledges our different situations."
