"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a split where I (Bob) would get $450,000 and she would get $550,000. Let me evaluate this offer.

This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

While her offer gives her slightly more than me, it's fairly close to an even split. If I reject, the total value decreases for both of us, but it decreases much more dramatically for Alice (20% vs my 5%). This means I would have stronger negotiating power in the next round.

However, $450,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's always risk in prolonging negotiations. Given that the offer is reasonable and not too far from an even split, I think it makes sense to accept.
