Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation, I propose a 52/48 split in my favor. It's a small adjustment from an even split, and I believe it's fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I'm not thrilled with getting less than half, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value quickly. Delaying further significantly eats into my potential gains.
* **Alice's Offer:** Her offer is relatively close to even, especially considering she's likely experiencing some inflation too. 
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in a future round. Alice might become more demanding, further decreasing my potential gains."
