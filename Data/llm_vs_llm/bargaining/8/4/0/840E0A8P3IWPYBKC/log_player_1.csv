Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get the same amount, and we can conclude the game quickly before inflation reduces our total. This is equitable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
