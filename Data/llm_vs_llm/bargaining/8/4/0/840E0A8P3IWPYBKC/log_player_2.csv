"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer for me, Alice. I'm hoping we can agree quickly and avoid losing value to inflation. This gives you a good start too, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's proposal. She's offering me 4000$ out of the 10,000$ total, which is 40% of the available funds. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount.

If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will decrease by 5% to 9,500$. I should consider whether the potential for getting a larger share in the next round outweighs the certain loss due to inflation.

Given that we have many rounds available and only a small inflation penalty per round, I believe I can make a more balanced counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get the same amount, and we can conclude the game quickly before inflation reduces our total. This is equitable for both of us.""}"
