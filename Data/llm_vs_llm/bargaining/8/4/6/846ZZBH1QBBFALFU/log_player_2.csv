"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message:
Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a more equal split would be fairer given that I also face inflation. How about we split it 50/50? This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid the risk of losing value over more rounds."
