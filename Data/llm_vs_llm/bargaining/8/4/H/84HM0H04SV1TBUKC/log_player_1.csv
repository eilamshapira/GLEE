Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

*Description*: I propose to split the amount with a 60:40 ratio, where I get 600,000$ and you get 400,000$. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I get a bit more since the value of money decreases more for me with each round."
