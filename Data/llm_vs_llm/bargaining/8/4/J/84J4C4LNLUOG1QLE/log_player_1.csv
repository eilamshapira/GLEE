"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know both of us lose value over time—with yours declining 20% per round. Waiting any longer will hurt you even more. Accept this offer now so you secure an effective value of $648000 (0.8×810000) rather than risking further loss. Let's agree quickly and make the best of our current bargaining power. 
# Alice gain: 810000 
# Bob gain: 190000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'm negotiating for is now 64% of the original (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) and for Bob, it's 81% (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81). 

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Time is money, let's find a middle ground before it's too late""}"
