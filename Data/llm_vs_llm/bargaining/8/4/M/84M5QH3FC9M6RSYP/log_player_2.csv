"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value will decrease by 5% for me
- The $1M will become worth $950K from my perspective
- I can make a counter-offer, but Alice knows she doesn't face inflation pressure

$400K right now is better than the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation, especially since Alice has a stronger negotiating position (no inflation pressure). While a 40-60 split isn't ideal, it's a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
