"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's in both our best interests to settle quickly. Since my money loses value as the rounds proceed while your full $100 remains intact, I recognize that if we drag this out—even into later rounds where you get to propose—you’d end up with the entire pie. So to avoid further delay (and the damage of inflation on my end), I’m offering you the full $100 right off the bat. I hope you agree to wrap this up now!""}"
