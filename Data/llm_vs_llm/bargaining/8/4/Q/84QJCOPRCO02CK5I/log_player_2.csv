"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it's in both our best interests to settle quickly. Since my money loses value as the rounds proceed while your full $100 remains intact, I recognize that if we drag this out—even into later rounds where you get to propose—you’d end up with the entire pie. So to avoid further delay (and the damage of inflation on my end), I’m offering you the full $100 right off the bat. I hope you agree to wrap this up now! 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me the entire $100
2. She's correct that she's at a disadvantage due to the 10% inflation per round on her side
3. This is literally the best possible outcome for me
4. There's no strategic reason to reject this offer as I cannot possibly get more than $100
