"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now vs. making a counter-offer where my share would need to be significantly higher to compensate for inflation

While the split isn't exactly equal, getting $40 now is better than risking a lower real value in the next round due to inflation. If I reject, my $40 would only be worth $32 in the next round due to inflation.
