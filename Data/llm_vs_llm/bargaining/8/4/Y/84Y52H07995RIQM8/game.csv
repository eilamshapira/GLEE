50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly at 50/50. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly since inflation will reduce our gains with each round. With your higher inflation rate of 10% per round versus my 5%, it's especially in your interest to agree sooner rather than later.",Alice,1,
