Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2. Remember, the value of the money is now worth less due to inflation. For me (Bob), it's 20% less. For Alice, it's 10% less.

However, since I am making the offer, I will base my offer on the original $10,000.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""alice_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4. Inflation continues to eat away at the value. I'm still basing my offer on the original $10,000, but I am also accounting for the decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""alice_gain"": 3000
}
