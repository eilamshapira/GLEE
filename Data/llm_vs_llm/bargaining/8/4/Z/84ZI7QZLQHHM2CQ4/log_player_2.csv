"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a significant amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of the $10,000. While this is less than half, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we continue to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the full $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round.

Given that I would make the next offer if I reject, I could potentially get more. However, there's risk in prolonging the game due to the inflation penalty that affects me.

Alice's offer of $4,500 now is equivalent to $5,625 in the next round (due to the 20% inflation). So this is actually a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.
