I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob takes 100,000 dollars. This is a fair offer as it gives me the majority of the money while still ensuring Bob gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to give up some more of the money, but I need a better share than 100,000. I propose 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob."
