"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% upfront. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   * I could propose a better split for myself
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

The offer isn't great, but considering the devaluation risk and that Alice might reject a much more favorable offer to me in the next round, I should probably reject and try for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that money devalues 10% for Alice and 5% for me each round, I'll propose a more balanced split while emphasizing our mutual interest in reaching an agreement quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""A fair 50-50 split is better for both of us. If you reject, your next round money will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less. Let's be efficient and agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  I'll take a smaller cut to close this deal. 55 for me, 45 for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $45 for me (worth $40.61 due to 9.75% inflation)
2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth even less (14.75% less for me, 29% less for Alice)
   * Any further delay significantly hurts both of us
   * Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer

This is a reasonable improvement from her first offer, and considering the accelerating inflation impact, further negotiation might leave us both worse off. I should accept.
