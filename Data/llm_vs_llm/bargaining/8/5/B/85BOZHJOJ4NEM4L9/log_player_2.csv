"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $531,441 (roughly 53.1%) of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * Current offer's real value to me = $531,441
   * Next round's maximum value to me = $900,000 (90% of original value)

Given that:
- The offer is fair (I get slightly more than half)
- Waiting will only decrease the value for me
- Alice seems to be acting reasonably
- There's risk in continuing negotiation
