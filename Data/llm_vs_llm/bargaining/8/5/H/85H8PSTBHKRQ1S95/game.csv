6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering you face 10% devaluation per round while I don't. This is a fair offer that gives you good value now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the devaluation I face each round, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This offer still gives you a significant portion while allowing me to mitigate some of the inflation impact. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With 20% devaluation already affecting you, you should accept this reasonable 55-45 split in my favor. Further delays will only reduce the real value you receive. This is a fair middle ground.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, with each round, the value I receive decreases significantly due to inflation. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This offer still ensures you get a substantial amount, but it's crucial for me to counteract the devaluation effect. Let's reach an agreement soon to avoid further loss in value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, you're now facing 34% devaluation. Let's be rational - this 52-48 split in my favor is very fair considering the circumstances. Further delays will significantly reduce your real value. This is a balanced offer that works for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, the devaluation is now over 34%, and it's critical for me to secure a larger share to offset this loss. I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This offer still leaves you with a significant amount, but I need to protect my interests given the rapid decrease in value. Let's agree soon to avoid further erosion of the money's worth.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a perfectly fair 50-50 split now. You're facing 47% devaluation, and further delays will only hurt you more. This is my most balanced offer - you get $5000 now which is much better than a larger nominal amount that's worth less later. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, with the devaluation now at nearly 47%, I need to propose a 70-30 split in my favor to counteract the significant loss in value. This offer still ensures you receive a considerable amount, but I must protect my interests given the rapid decrease in the money's worth. Let's reach an agreement soon to avoid further erosion.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. You're now facing 57% devaluation. A 50-50 split right now is actually better for you than getting even 7000 later. Your $5000 now is worth more than $7000 in the next round. This is your best opportunity to maximize your real value - further delays will only hurt both of us.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, with the devaluation now at nearly 57%, I must propose a 75-25 split in my favor to mitigate the severe loss in value. This offer still leaves you with a quarter of the total, but I need to secure a larger share to counteract the rapid decrease in the money's worth. We're running out of time, so let's agree soon to avoid further erosion.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round and you're facing 65% devaluation. Your $5000 now is worth far more than even $7500 in the next round. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing in round 12. This 50-50 split is your last good chance to secure real value. Be rational and accept.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, this is our last chance. With the devaluation now at 65%, I need to propose an 80-20 split in my favor to salvage any real value. This offer still gives you 2000$, but I must secure a larger share to counteract the severe loss. If we don't agree now, we both get nothing. Let's make a deal.",Bob,12,
