"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering you face 10% devaluation per round while I don't. This is a fair offer that gives you good value now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With 20% devaluation already affecting you, you should accept this reasonable 55-45 split in my favor. Further delays will only reduce the real value you receive. This is a fair middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're now facing 34% devaluation. Let's be rational - this 52-48 split in my favor is very fair considering the circumstances. Further delays will significantly reduce your real value. This is a balanced offer that works for both of us.
