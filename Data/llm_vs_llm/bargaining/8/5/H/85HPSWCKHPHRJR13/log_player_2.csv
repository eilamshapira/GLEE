"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $45, Alice gets $55
2. If I reject and we move to next round:
   * The total value decreases (10% for me, 5% for Alice)
   * I can make the next proposal
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

The current offer is relatively fair, and considering the significant devaluation rate for me (10%), getting $45 now is better than risking a next round where the total value would be less.
