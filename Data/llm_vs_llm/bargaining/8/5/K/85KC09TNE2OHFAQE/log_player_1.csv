"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, but considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds, I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a small advantage. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 5% less to me, so this offer should be appealing enough for both of us to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that inflation affects my gains and we're only in round 2, I'll reject this offer. While Bob's counteroffer isn't terrible, I know that my initial offer was more favorable, and I still have opportunities to negotiate better terms. The 5% inflation means I'd only effectively get $427,500 (450,000 * 0.95) in value, which I find too low at this early stage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my first offer and made a counter-offer favoring himself, I'll adjust my strategy slightly. I need to account for the fact that my gains are now worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation, so I'll increase my requested share to compensate while still keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

With 10% inflation on my side, this would effectively be worth $540,000 to me (600,000 * 0.9), which is closer to my original proposal's real value. This offer gives Bob a significant portion while helping me maintain value despite inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting - Bob is offering exactly what I just proposed in the previous round. Since inflation has increased to 14.26%, this $600,000 would be worth approximately $514,440 to me (600,000 * 0.8574), which is still a decent amount. Given that:
1. We're already in round 4
2. Further delays will only reduce my effective gains more
3. Bob has moved significantly from his previous position to match my last offer

I'll accept this offer before inflation erodes more value.
