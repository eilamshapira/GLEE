"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal seems somewhat imbalanced. Given that inflation reduces the value of money more rapidly for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I should propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing this split because we both face inflation, but Alice's is much higher at 20% per round compared to my 5%. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose significantly more value with each round, but Alice will lose more quickly. This offer gives her a substantial portion while recognizing my inflation advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by just 2% compared to her first offer, which isn't a significant improvement. Given that we're now in round 3, inflation has already reduced the value of our potential gains. If this continues, we'll both lose more value. However, since my inflation rate (5% per round) is much lower than Alice's (20% per round), I have a strategic advantage in continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 4, and Alice has twice offered me less than half the money, I'll adjust my offer to be more attractive to her while still being advantageous to me, considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm offering you slightly more than my previous proposal. Given that your inflation rate is 20% per round compared to my 5%, continuing to negotiate is much costlier for you. If we reach an agreement now, we'll both be better off than if we continue further rounds. This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is gradually increasing her offers to me (from 40 to 42 to now 44), but we're now in round 5 where inflation has significantly affected our potential gains. Alice's money has lost almost 60% of its value, while mine has lost about 19%. Given that we only have 12 rounds total, and the money will be worth nothing if we don't agree, I should consider accepting to stop further value erosion.

However, considering that Alice's inflation rate is so much higher, I still have negotiating leverage and could potentially get a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 6, and inflation has significantly eroded our potential gains, especially for Alice. I'll make a more moderate offer that should be compelling for both of us to finalize this negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the standard fair division. At this point, with your 20% inflation rate per round compared to my 5%, continuing to negotiate is extremely costly for you. Your potential gain has already lost over 59% of its original value. This equal split acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement soon, and represents a compromise from my previous positions."
