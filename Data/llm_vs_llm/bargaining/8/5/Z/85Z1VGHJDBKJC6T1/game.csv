500000.0,500000.0,"I understand we both want a good portion of the money, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Remember that if you reject this, we'll both face further inflation penalties, reducing the overall value for both parties.",Bob,2,
