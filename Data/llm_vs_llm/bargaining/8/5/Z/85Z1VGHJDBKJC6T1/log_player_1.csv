Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I think this is a fair division considering the risks of inflation. Let's secure a good portion for both of us!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want a good portion of the money, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Remember that if you reject this, we'll both face further inflation penalties, reducing the overall value for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
