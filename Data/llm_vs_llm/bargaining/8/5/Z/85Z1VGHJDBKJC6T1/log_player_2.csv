"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair division considering the risks of inflation. Let's secure a good portion for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $100,000 while she gets $900,000, which means she would get 90% of the total amount. This seems quite imbalanced in her favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I would face 20% inflation, meaning the money would be worth less to me. However, the current split is so uneven that making a counter-offer likely makes sense despite the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split considering the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I understand we both want a good portion of the money, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Remember that if you reject this, we'll both face further inflation penalties, reducing the overall value for both parties.""}"
