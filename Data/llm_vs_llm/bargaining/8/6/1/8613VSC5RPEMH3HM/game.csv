700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting 70% and you getting 30%. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. If we go to the next round, we'd both lose value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects me by 10% each round, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
