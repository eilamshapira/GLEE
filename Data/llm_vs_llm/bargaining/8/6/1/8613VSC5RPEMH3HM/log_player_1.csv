"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting 70% and you getting 30%. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. If we go to the next round, we'd both lose value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects me by 10% each round, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation factor.

If I reject and we go to round 3, the money I receive will be worth another 5% less (so 90.25% of original value). Bob claims his inflation is 10% per round, so he'd lose more by continuing.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which at 95% value equals $427,500 in round 1 terms. If I were to counter in round 3, even if I asked for more, the inflation would reduce its value further.

Since Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation factors, and further negotiation would likely result in diminishing returns for both of us:
