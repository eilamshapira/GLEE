"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting 70% and you getting 30%. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. If we go to the next round, we'd both lose value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
