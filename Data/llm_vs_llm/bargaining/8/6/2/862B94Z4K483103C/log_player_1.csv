"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, his share will be worth less in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers me $40 and takes $60
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - For Bob, his money will be worth another 10% less (worth 81% of original value)
   - My money keeps its full value
3. This gives me strong negotiating power for the next round
4. $40 is less than my initial offer, and I know I have a better position due to inflation not affecting me

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob rejected my first offer of 60/40 and his money is now worth even less (only 81% of original value), I can justify asking for a larger share. He should be more motivated to accept now to avoid further depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. This might seem aggressive, but considering that Bob's money is losing value each round while mine isn't, this is actually a reasonable offer. If he rejects this, his next round's money will only be worth about 73% of the original value."
