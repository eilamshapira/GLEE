"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer that respects both of our interests, and accepting it now means we avoid the 20% inflation penalty of future rounds."
