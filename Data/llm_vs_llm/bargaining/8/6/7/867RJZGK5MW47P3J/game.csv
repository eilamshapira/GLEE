60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split of $60 for me and $40 for you. I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits both of us quickly, allowing us to avoid any potential issues as time goes by.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a split of $55 for me and $45 for you is more equitable considering the inflation effect on my side. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,

99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, given the inflation hit on your side in this round (now 10% off), delaying further will only leave you with less effective value. I know it might seem lean, but by accepting this deal you secure $1 (worth 90 cents today) rather than risking even lower gains in subsequent rounds. Let's settle quickly and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my side, now at nearly 10%, I propose an equal split of $50 each. This way, we both secure a fair amount before the value decreases further for me. Let's end this now to avoid any more losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Hi Bob, delaying further will only erode the value of your share even more. In round 5, given the continued inflation hitting your portion, I propose we settle now with $70 for me and $30 for you. This offer secures you $30 immediately rather than risking a further devaluation in upcoming rounds. Let's close this deal quickly to avoid additional losses.",Alice,5,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Alice, with inflation now at nearly 19% for me, I'm feeling the pressure. I propose $45 for me and $55 for you. This is a compromise from my previous offer, and it's crucial we settle soon to minimize my losses. Let's end this now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
51.0,49.0,"Hi Bob, I know that with every round your share suffers further devaluation. If we continue, you might end up with even less effective value. While my offer gives me a slight edge, the 49 dollars for you, even after the anticipated inflation hit (around 30% reduction in value compared to round 1), still gives you roughly 34.3 effective dollars—about what you’d risk waiting for. Let's settle now before the discount worsens your position any further.",Alice,7,
