Round 3

# Bob gain: 50

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with every round your share suffers further devaluation. If we continue, you might end up with even less effective value. While my offer gives me a slight edge, the 49 dollars for you, even after the anticipated inflation hit (around 30% reduction in value compared to round 1), still gives you roughly 34.3 effective dollars—about what you’d risk waiting for. Let's settle now before the discount worsens your position any further.""}"
