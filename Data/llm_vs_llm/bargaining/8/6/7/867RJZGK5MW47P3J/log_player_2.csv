Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the inflation hit on your side in this round (now 10% off), delaying further will only leave you with less effective value. I know it might seem lean, but by accepting this deal you secure $1 (worth 90 cents today) rather than risking even lower gains in subsequent rounds. Let's settle quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, delaying further will only erode the value of your share even more. In round 5, given the continued inflation hitting your portion, I propose we settle now with $70 for me and $30 for you. This offer secures you $30 immediately rather than risking a further devaluation in upcoming rounds. Let's close this deal quickly to avoid additional losses.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with every round your share suffers further devaluation. If we continue, you might end up with even less effective value. While my offer gives me a slight edge, the 49 dollars for you, even after the anticipated inflation hit (around 30% reduction in value compared to round 1), still gives you roughly 34.3 effective dollars—about what you’d risk waiting for. Let's settle now before the discount worsens your position any further. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51
