"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an even split, ensuring fairness for both of us right from the beginning! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than it does for Alice (5% per round). With that in mind, I should evaluate if waiting would be beneficial.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, the total pot would be worth 20% less to me (worth $8,000 to me) and 5% less to Alice (worth $9,500 to her). This gives me less negotiating power as rounds progress.

Given the significant difference in our inflation rates, I should accept a fair offer now rather than risk diminishing returns.
