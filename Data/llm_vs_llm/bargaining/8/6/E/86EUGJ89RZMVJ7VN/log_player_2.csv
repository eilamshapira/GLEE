"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Alice suggests I (Bob) receive only $1,000 while Alice gets $9,000 out of the total $10,000. This is a highly unfavorable split for me.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (the money is worth 0% less each round for Bob), I have no pressure to accept an unfair offer. However, Alice faces 10% inflation each round, which means any delay is costly for her.

Given these conditions, I can reject this offer and make a more favorable proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, her $4,000 in this round is worth more than waiting another round where her share would be devalued. This is a fair offer considering that I don't face any inflation penalty, while she loses 10% of value with each passing round. This division gives me a reasonable majority while still offering Alice a substantial portion that should be attractive given her inflation constraint."
