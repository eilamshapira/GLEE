"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you started with a 60-40 split, I believe a slight adjustment towards a more balanced division is fair, considering we're now in the second round and both have a chance to propose.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it gives him a slightly larger share, it's a reasonable compromise from my initial proposal and avoids further rounds of negotiation which could lead to diminishing returns for both parties."
