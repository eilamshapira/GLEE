"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 35, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is approximately 35 * 0.81 = 28.35.

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing. Since I don't know the inflation rate for Alice, I'll try to make a reasonable offer.

The money is worth 19% less for me, and it's been two rounds, so the value is 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729 of the original value for me.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
