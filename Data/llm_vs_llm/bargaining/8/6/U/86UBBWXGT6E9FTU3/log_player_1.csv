"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, considering the potential for inflation and the need to secure a good portion early:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. It might seem a bit greedy, but I'm prioritizing securing a larger share upfront to mitigate the potential impact of inflation in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a guaranteed $400,000 rather than risking a smaller, devalued amount later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering a 50/50 split. While it seems fair at first glance, I need to factor in the inflation. My potential gain of $500,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in round 1, effectively $400,000.

Given the risk of further inflation in subsequent rounds, and the fact that this is effectively the same amount as Bob offered me in the previous round, I will accept this.
