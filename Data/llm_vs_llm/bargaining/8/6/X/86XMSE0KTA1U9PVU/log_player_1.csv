"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I'll take the slight advantage this round. We can both still get more than if we wait 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I calculate my gain as 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

Since Bob's offer gives me $3600 (after inflation), which is less than what I would have gotten if I had accepted my own offer in Round 1, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own losses.

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% * 2 = 20% less than the original value, so I calculate my gain as 0.8x, where x is the amount I propose to myself.
The money Bob gains is worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% in Round 1 + 20% in Round 2, but applied only once as it is his gain), but for the next round it will be 20% * 3 = 60% less, so I calculate his gain as 0.6x, where x is the amount I propose to him, but for this round it is still 0.8x for him (20% less in the first round and 20% less in the second round, applied only once as it is his gain in this round).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much!""}"
