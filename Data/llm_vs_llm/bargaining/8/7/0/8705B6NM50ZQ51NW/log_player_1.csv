"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the game (keeping in mind that the money loses 10% per round for you and 5% per round for Bob, and that when a proposal is made the responder will only accept if what they get “now” is at least as good as what they’d expect (discounted) by waiting for their turn to propose), one finds that if both sides are perfectly rational the “subgame‐perfect” equilibrium (in nominal dollars) in round 1 is roughly as follows:

• Alice (the proposer in round 1) keeps about $210,118.
• Bob receives about $789,882.

The way to think about this is as follows. Work backward from round 12. In round 12 Bob would be the proposer—since the game is “take it or leave it” (if the responder gets nothing by rejection, even an arbitrarily small positive amount would be acceptable), Bob can claim nearly all of the $1,000,000 at that stage. Then in round 11, when Alice is the proposer, she must offer Bob at least what he could guarantee for himself in round 12 (discounted back one round at Bob’s discount rate of 5% per round). That forces her to keep only about 5% (namely, $50,000) herself. Working this reasoning back and forth (alternating the “costs” of waiting—10% per round for you and 5% per round for Bob) yields the equilibrium outcome in round 1:
  Alice’s share ≈ $210,118  and  Bob’s share ≈ $789,882.

So here is my offer in the requested JSON format:
