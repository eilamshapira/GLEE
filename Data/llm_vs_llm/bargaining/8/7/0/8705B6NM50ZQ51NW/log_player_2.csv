"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 789882 
# Alice gain: 210118 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me approximately 79% of the money ($789,882), while taking about 21% ($210,118) for herself.

If I reject:
- The money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
- It will be worth 10% less to Alice
- I'll get to make the next proposal

While I could try to negotiate for an even better deal, this is actually quite a favorable split for me. If I reject, the total value decreases, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal after accounting for the inflation penalty.

$789,882 is a very good offer in the first round. I'll take it.
