"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's get this done quickly! I'm offering you 100k to accept now. Think of the diminishing value of the money if we keep going! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8). For Alice, it's worth 5% less, so 950,000 (1,000,000 * 0.95). However, the nominal amount we're dividing is still $1,000,000.

I'll make a reasonable offer considering the diminishing value.
