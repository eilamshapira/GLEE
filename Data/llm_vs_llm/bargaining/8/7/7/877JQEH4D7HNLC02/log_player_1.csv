"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair for both! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's $50 offer, it's actually worth $47.50 to me.

If I reject and make another offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less. So I'd need to get significantly more than $50 to make up for the additional inflation loss.

Given that Bob is offering an even split, which is generally considered fair, and considering the inflation penalty for waiting another round, I should accept this offer.
