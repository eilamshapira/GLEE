400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think 60% for me and 40% for you is a more reasonable split now. The longer we wait, the more we both lose.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting hard, especially on my side. Let's go for an even split of 50-50 to end this quickly and minimize our losses. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the massive hit inflation is taking on your share, I'm willing to take 65% and give you 35%. This is likely the best offer you'll get, given the circumstances.",Bob,6,

450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, inflation is really affecting my share now. I'm willing to compromise at 45% for me and 55% for you. Let's end this soon before it gets worse.",Alice,7,

300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice, given the extreme impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take 70% and give you 30%. This is likely the last reasonable offer you'll get, as the value of the money continues to plummet.",Bob,8,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, the value of the money is dropping fast for me. I'm proposing 40% for me and 60% for you. Let's settle this now before it's too late.",Alice,9,

250000.0,750000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the drastic devaluation of the money, especially on your side, I'm willing to take 75% and give you 25%. This is likely the last chance to walk away with something, as the value will soon be negligible.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the money is almost worthless for me now. I'm offering 35% for me and 65% for you. Let's end this before we both get nothing.",Alice,11,
