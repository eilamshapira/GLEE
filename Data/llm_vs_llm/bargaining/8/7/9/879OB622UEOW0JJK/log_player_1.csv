Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given how waiting affects the money for both of us (your share losing 20% per round and mine 5%), this proposal reflects our realistic bargaining positions. I’m offering you 166667, which, with your 20% discount, secures for you an effective value similar to what you’d get if you waited. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses! 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider our respective discounts: in Round 4, every dollar I receive is worth about 0.857 of its nominal value and every dollar you receive is worth 0.512. If you reject this offer, you'd become the proposer in Round 5—but your share would be affected by a 20% per round discount, reducing the total effective value you can secure to roughly $409600. By accepting this offer now, you receive $800000 nominally which is exactly 800000 × 0.512 = $409600 in effective terms. I’m taking $200000, which comes to about $171475 effective for me. Given our future prospects and the further erosion in value with every round, I believe this proposal is the most efficient way for us both to maximize what we get. Let's settle this before the value diminishes any further. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000
