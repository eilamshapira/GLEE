"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both be happy with this. Let's get it done! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, given how waiting affects the money for both of us (your share losing 20% per round and mine 5%), this proposal reflects our realistic bargaining positions. I’m offering you 166,667, which, with your 20% discount, secures for you an effective value similar to what you’d get if you waited. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try again.  I'm adjusting to get this done.  Consider this a fair offer given the losses we're both incurring. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer gives me a nominal 600,000, when I account for the 9.75% inflation penalty in round 3 your proposal delivers an effective value of about 541,500 for me. Given that if I reject I become the proposer in round 4—at which point, due to my lower discounting (only 5% per round) compared to your 20%—I can steer the division to secure an effective payoff well above 541,500, I must reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider our respective discounts: in Round 4, every dollar I receive is worth about 0.857 of its nominal value and every dollar you receive is worth 0.512. If you reject this offer, you'd become the proposer in Round 5—but your share would be affected by a 20% per round discount, reducing the total effective value you can secure to roughly $409,600. By accepting this offer now, you receive $800,000 nominally which is exactly 800,000 × 0.512 = $409,600 in effective terms. I’m taking $200,000, which comes to about $171,475 effective for me. Given our future prospects and the further erosion in value with every round, I believe this proposal is the most efficient way for us both to maximize what we get. Let's settle this before the value diminishes any further.""}"
