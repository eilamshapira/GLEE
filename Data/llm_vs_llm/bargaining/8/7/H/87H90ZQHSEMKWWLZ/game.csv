35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand you want a fair division, but I also need to account for the potential impact of inflation. How about I get $65 and you get $35? This is fairer considering the risk I'm taking by delaying a decision.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,Iâ€™m offering you a little more this time. How about 55% for me and 45% for you? Let's find a middle ground.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I need 70 now to make it worthwhile. Let's secure a deal before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's keep it simple and equal this time. How about a 50-50 split? It's fair for both of us and avoids any further risks.,Alice,5,

25.0,75.0,"Alice, my gains are diminishing rapidly due to inflation. I need 75 now to compensate for the lost value. This is my final offer before the risk becomes too great.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,I understand inflation is affecting things. How about I take 45% and you take 55%? It's a step up for you and we can avoid losing everything.,Alice,7,
