"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4500 in this round is worth less than $4500 in the previous round. Let's calculate the equivalent value from Round 1 for comparison:

My $4500 in Round 2 is worth 20% less than Round 1, so the equivalent value from Round 1 is: 4500 / (1 - 0.20) = 4500 / 0.8 = 5625

Compared to my original offer of $6000 for myself, $4500 is not a good deal, especially with the inflation.

Therefore, I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
