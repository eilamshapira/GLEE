"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split where she gets $600,000 and I get $400,000. While this isn't an even 50-50 split, I need to remember that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me due to inflation, while Alice doesn't face this disadvantage.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%, meaning the maximum I could get would be $950,000 total value. Even if I somehow managed to get all of it, that would be worth less than getting $400,000 now.

Given the inflation pressure on my side, this offer is actually reasonable.
