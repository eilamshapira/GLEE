"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The total amount is $1,000,000, and Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 20% to $800,000. 

While the offer isn't exactly equal, $400,000 is still a substantial amount. If I reject and we continue haggling, we risk losing more value through inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll end up with a better deal.
