"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is quite unfair, giving Alice 80% of the money while I only get 20%. Since this is the first round and the inflation penalty is not yet severe, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This way, both Alice and I get an equal share of $500,000. This is a more equitable distribution than the previous offer, and considering that the money will lose 20% of its value if Alice rejects this offer, it should be an attractive proposition for both parties."
