"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation for me and potential complications for both, I propose we settle this round with a fair split: $500,000 for each of us. Let’s secure the deal now for our mutual benefit. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation impact on me, I need a bit more. Let's settle with $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we can both walk away with a good deal before the money loses more value for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I’m not comfortable with that split. Although I understand your situation with inflation, my effective value at 450,000 in round 2 isn’t appealing enough, given that I lose less per round than you. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement if we explore a bit more in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 447000, ""bob_gain"": 553000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're both feeling the pressure of inflation as rounds go by, and I'd prefer we settle the deal now before our winnings erode further. In Round 3, my money is already 10% less valuable, so I'm proposing a division that gives you 553,000 and me 447,000. This offer nets you roughly 442,400 in effective value (if your discount remains around 20% from the first round), which is a slight improvement over your Round 2 outcome, while it’s the best I can manage given my losses. Let’s close this deal now and avoid further losses.""}"
