"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation for me and potential complications for both, I propose we settle this round with a fair split: $500000 for each of us. Let’s secure the deal now for our mutual benefit. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation impact on me, I need a bit more. Let's settle with $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we can both walk away with a good deal before the money loses more value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're both feeling the pressure of inflation as rounds go by, and I'd prefer we settle the deal now before our winnings erode further. In Round 3, my money is already 10% less valuable, so I'm proposing a division that gives you 553000 and me 447000. This offer nets you roughly 442400 in effective value (if your discount remains around 20% from the first round), which is a slight improvement over your Round 2 outcome, while it’s the best I can manage given my losses. Let’s close this deal now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 553000 
# Alice gain: 447000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
