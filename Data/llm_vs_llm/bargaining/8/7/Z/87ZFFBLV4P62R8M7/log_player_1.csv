"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 and you receive $40. Accepting this offer now is beneficial since the value of the money for me decreases over rounds. Let's settle early and avoid unnecessary discounting. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, to avoid further discounting on my end Iâ€™d like to settle now. I propose a division of $45 for me and $55 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise that lets us both avoid the costly effects of delay. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
