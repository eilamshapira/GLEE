"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me taking $600000 and you taking $400000. This seems fair considering the inflation affects you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. Let's settle before the money devalues further for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation impact on you, I'm willing to adjust the split. Let's settle this round as it benefits you more to finish earlier. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450000 I would gain is actually worth around 64% of its original value (100% - 36%). So, the effective value for me would be around $288000 (450000 * 0.64).

Given this, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.
