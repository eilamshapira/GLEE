"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, I have an advantage: Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice's 50 would be worth only 45 to her
4. This means I could potentially get a better deal in the next round
5. It's worth trying to negotiate for a better split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I have a strategic advantage due to Alice's 10% value loss per round, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being acceptable enough that Alice might take it rather than risk another round where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

My reasoning is:
1. For Alice, this 40$ now is worth more than a potential 50$ next round (which would be worth 45$ to her)
2. If she rejects, and we go another round, any money she gets will be worth 10% less to her
3. This offer is better for me than the initial 50-50 split, but not so greedy that it would certainly be rejected"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has offered me 55$, which is better than the initial 50-50 split
2. For Alice, her 45$ is actually worth only about 36.45$ (due to 19% inflation)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - Alice's money will be worth 29% less than the initial value
   - I could try for a better split
4. However, there's a risk Alice might make an even less favorable offer if we continue
5. 55$ is a decent improvement from the initial offer, and Alice is already taking a significant hit from inflation
