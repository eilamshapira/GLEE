"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and avoid excessive rounds of inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 4000$ for me and 6000$ for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me (so 10,000$ becomes worth 9,000$ to me)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. A 60/40 split is somewhat uneven, but not extremely unfair
4. If we keep negotiating, we might both lose value due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a better split, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this offer reasonable enough to accept.
