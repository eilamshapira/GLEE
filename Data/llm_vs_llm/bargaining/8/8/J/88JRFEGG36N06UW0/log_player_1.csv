"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that inflation affects my gains but not Bob's.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50 but slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I would face if Bob rejects and we move to the next round. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further devaluation of my share through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's not ideal, it's still a reasonable split. If I reject, my potential gains in future rounds will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation penalty. My $4700 with 5% inflation is worth $4465, which is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It's rational to secure this amount now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
