"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage since I'm making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable split, given the time constraint and the potential for the money to diminish in value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: While I'm losing out a bit compared to my initial offer, the inflation is starting to bite. If I reject this, the money will be worth even less to me next round. Bob's offer is still a decent chunk, and I'd rather secure something now than risk getting even less later."
