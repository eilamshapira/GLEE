Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is of the essence for me – my share loses value each round due to inflation. Even though you’re patient, I must settle now. I'm offering you $70 and taking $30, which I believe is fair given my declining position. Let's agree quickly before further rounds erode our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
