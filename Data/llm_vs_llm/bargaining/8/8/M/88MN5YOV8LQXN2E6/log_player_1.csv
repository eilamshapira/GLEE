"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while securing a slightly larger share for myself. It's a fair starting point that acknowledges both our positions and should encourage quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
My real value = $4500 * 0.95 = $4275

If I reject and we continue to next round, the inflation will increase, reducing the value further. While I'd prefer a higher share, this is still a reasonable offer considering:
1. The increasing inflation pressure
2. We still have many rounds left but value is decreasing
3. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
