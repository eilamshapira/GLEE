"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm proposing a split where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. This might seem unfair at first glance.
*   However, I'm already factoring in the potential impact of future inflation. If Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth less to me in the next round.
*   I believe this offer gives Bob a significant portion while also securing a reasonable amount for myself, considering the risk of devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him.

Given that the money I receive is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, I need to consider if $300,000 (at 80% value) is better than the potential future offers, keeping in mind further devaluation.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer for me: $300,000 * 0.8 = $240,000 (in round 1 dollars).

Since it is very little money, I will reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. It's Round 3, and the money I receive is now worth 40% less than in Round 1 (20% less than in Round 2). I need to factor this significant devaluation into my offer.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

My Reasoning:

*   I'm proposing a 75/25 split. This appears very skewed towards me, but it is crucial to understand the situation:
    *   For me, Alice, $750,000 in Round 3 money is equivalent to $750,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $450,000 in Round 1 money.
    *   Bob still gets $250,000, which is a reasonable amount.
*   This offer represents my last chance to get a decent amount of the money. If Bob rejects, the value of my potential gain in the next round will diminish drastically.
*   I am hoping that Bob sees the logic of this offer, recognizing that the substantial inflation affecting my portion necessitates a larger nominal share for me to receive a comparable real value."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is $200,000 for me and $800,000 for him. The money I receive is now worth 48.8% less than in Round 1.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer for me: $200,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $200,000 * 0.512 = $102,400 (in round 1 dollars).

This is a very low amount, especially considering the original sum and the risks I've taken so far. At this point, accepting feels like a significant loss. However, rejecting means entering another round with even greater devaluation.

Let's quickly calculate the value of the money in round 5. It will be worth 20% less than in Round 4, thus worth 0.512*0.8 = 0.4096 of the original value.

Since Bob is clearly trying to give me as little as possible, and it is increasingly difficult to get a decent amount of money, I will reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. It's Round 5, and the money I receive is now worth 59.04% less than in Round 1. This is extremely detrimental, and I need to make a final, compelling offer, even if it seems ridiculously skewed.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

My Reasoning:

*   I am requesting a 90/10 split. This appears incredibly unfair, but let's look at the real value for me:
    *   $900,000 in Round 5 money is equivalent to $900,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $900,000 * 0.4096 = $368,640 in Round 1 money.

*   Bob still gets $100,000.
*   If Bob rejects this, I will be in a terrible position. The next round's devaluation will make any offer almost worthless. I am hoping Bob will accept $100,000 to end the game.

This is my final offer, reflecting the drastic impact of inflation on my potential gains."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is $300,000 for me, and the money I receive is now worth 67.23% less than in Round 1.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer for me: $300,000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $300,000 * 0.3277 = $98,310 (in Round 1 dollars).

This is an extremely low amount. However, considering the continuous devaluation, what would I even gain by continuing?

If I reject, the next round will devalue my money by 20% again. The money will be worth 0.3277 * 0.8 = 0.26216 of its original value. I would have to demand a 99/1 split to even make $260k in original value.

I will accept Bob's offer.
