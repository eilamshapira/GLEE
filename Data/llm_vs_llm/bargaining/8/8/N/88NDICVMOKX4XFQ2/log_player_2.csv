Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer has improved slightly in terms of the raw numbers, the devaluation of the money makes this still unacceptable. I need to push for a larger share while the money holds more value for Alice."

This offer is unacceptable.  While I understand that the value is rapidly declining for Alice, holding out for a better deal is still the best option."

I'm slightly lowering my demand, hoping Alice will see the benefit of taking this offer before the value diminishes even further for her."
