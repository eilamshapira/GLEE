"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer:
- I would get $4,000
- Alice would get $6,000
- This is the first round
- If I reject, the money loses 10% of its value for me in the next round
- I can make a counter-offer next round if I reject

This isn't quite an even split, but I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value of any future agreement. If I reject, I'll only have $9,000 worth of value to split in the next round from my perspective.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, so I'll reject this initial proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For my counter-offer, I need to consider both fairness and the impact of inflation. While a 50-50 split would be $5,000 each, I should account for the fact that we're already in round 2, so the total value to me has decreased by 10%.

I'll propose a slightly better deal for me than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable enough that she might accept:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the total amount. If Alice rejects this, we'll move to round 3 where the money will be worth even less to me, and she'll make the next offer."
