Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's consider the inflation. My previous offer of $6000 is now effectively worth $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 in round 2 dollars. Bob's rejection and the additional round of inflation further erode the value of the money for me. I need to make an offer that is high enough to be accepted, but also accounts for the continued inflation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze the situation. My money is worth 48.8% less, and Bob's money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Bob offered a 50/50 split.

If I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation for me. Accepting $5000 at 48.8% less means I effectively get $5000 * (1 - 0.488) = $2560 in original round 1 dollars.

While not ideal, this is likely the best I'll get given the rapid inflation. I'll accept.
