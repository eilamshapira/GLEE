"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob in this first round. Given that there's inflation for Bob (losing 20% of value per round) but not for me, I should consider this in my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 8000,
""bob_gain"": 2000}

I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances. Bob faces 20% inflation per round, so taking $2000 now is better than potentially getting less real value later. This division gives Bob a meaningful portion while recognizing my stronger position in the negotiation due to the asymmetric inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer this time, considering that we're now in round 3 and Bob's inflation is increasing.

{""alice_gain"": 7500,
""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm increasing my offer to Bob compared to my first proposal. Since Bob is facing 20% inflation per round, the value of money to him decreases significantly with each passing round. At this point, $2500 for Bob in round 3 is worth about $1600 in round 1 value to him due to the compounding inflation. This division recognizes the time pressure Bob faces while still securing a reasonable portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
