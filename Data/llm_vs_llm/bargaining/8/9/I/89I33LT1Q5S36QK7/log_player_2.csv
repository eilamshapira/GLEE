"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000, meaning $5,000 for each of us. That's fair on the surface.

However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth less to me in the next round when I make my counter-offer. On the other hand, if I make a counter-offer, Alice might accept a division that gives me slightly more.

Given that there's a 5% inflation penalty each round, waiting would reduce the real value of my share. The 50-50 split is fair and reasonable, and I risk losing value by rejecting.
