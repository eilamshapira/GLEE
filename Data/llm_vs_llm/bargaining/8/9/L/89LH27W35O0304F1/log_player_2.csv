"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, the total will be worth 10% less to me, so the $100 would effectively be worth $90 from my perspective.

If I accept Alice's offer now, I get $40. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I would need to secure more than $44.44 (since $44.44 in the next round would be equivalent to $40 now after 10% inflation).

Let me make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation affecting me while also being fair enough that Alice would likely accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing this split because while the original $40 offer was too low for me, I understand we both need to find an acceptable middle ground. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation per round, I need to secure a better deal now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation where the money would be worth even less to me."
