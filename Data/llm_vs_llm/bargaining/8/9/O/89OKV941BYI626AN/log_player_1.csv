"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob $450,000 while taking $550,000 for myself. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that I'll lose 10% value each round if we delay agreement."
