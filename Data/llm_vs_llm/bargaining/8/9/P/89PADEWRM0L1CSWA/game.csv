48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more than you (10% vs 5%), a fair split should actually give me a bit more. I'm proposing 52/48 in my favor, which accounts for our different inflation rates. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value, so this is a win-win solution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting both of us. My money is now worth 10% less than before, and yours is worth 20% less. I need a bigger share to compensate. I propose 60/40.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, let's be practical here. With continuing inflation, we're both losing value - I'm already at 27.1% inflation cumulative and you're at 14.26%. If we keep going, we both get less. My proposal of 53/47 is fair considering our differential inflation rates. If you reject this, we'll both lose even more in the next round. This is our best chance to maximize our combined outcome.",Bob,4,
