Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more than you (10% vs 5%), a fair split should actually give me a bit more. I'm proposing 52/48 in my favor, which accounts for our different inflation rates. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value, so this is a win-win solution. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical here. With continuing inflation, we're both losing value - I'm already at 27.1% inflation cumulative and you're at 14.26%. If we keep going, we both get less. My proposal of 53/47 is fair considering our differential inflation rates. If you reject this, we'll both lose even more in the next round. This is our best chance to maximize our combined outcome. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53
