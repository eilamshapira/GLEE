"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 55/45. A fair offer to start with! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 55/45 split in her favor. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but I have to factor in that inflation will reduce the total value by 10% for me and 5% for Alice in the next round.

If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice. That changes the dynamics of our negotiation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more than you (10% vs 5%), a fair split should actually give me a bit more. I'm proposing 52/48 in my favor, which accounts for our different inflation rates. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value, so this is a win-win solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting both of us. My money is now worth 10% less than before, and yours is worth 20% less. I need a bigger share to compensate. I propose 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation effects. With the current inflation, my $40 would be worth about $32.4 (a 19% reduction from original value), while Alice's $60 would be worth about $54.15 (a 9.75% reduction).

Alice's offer is worse for me than her initial offer, which isn't fair considering we're both suffering from inflation. If we continue to the next round, inflation will reduce our total value further, but I should be able to make a more equitable proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, 
""alice_gain"": 47, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical here. With continuing inflation, we're both losing value - I'm already at 27.1% inflation cumulative and you're at 14.26%. If we keep going, we both get less. My proposal of 53/47 is fair considering our differential inflation rates. If you reject this, we'll both lose even more in the next round. This is our best chance to maximize our combined outcome.""}"
