"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 with me taking $5500 and you getting $4500. Given that delays will reduce the value of the pie for both of us—and that it hits me harder—I believe this offer is fair. Let’s agree now to avoid unnecessary devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze Alice's offer.

*   **My gain:** $4500
*   **Alice's gain:** $5500

Since it's round 1, there's no inflation yet. If I reject, I'll have to make a proposal in round 2, but the total money will be effectively worth 10% less to me and 20% less to her.

$4500 seems like a reasonable starting point. I'll accept this offer.
