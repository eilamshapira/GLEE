30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm keen to settle quickly too, but I value my share a bit higher. How about $70 for me and $30 for you this round?  Let me know what you think.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but given the inflation hit I'm already taking and the fact that waiting another round might allow me to dial in a fairer split, I'm opting to move to the next round. Let's see if we can craft a proposal that better reflects our respective stakes.",Alice,2,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Bob, considering the further impact of inflation on my share in later rounds—and to keep things moving swiftly—I propose a split of $35 for me and $65 for you this round. I believe this offer gives you a solid effective value while avoiding even steeper losses down the road. I hope you agree that settling now is in both of our best interests. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,3,
