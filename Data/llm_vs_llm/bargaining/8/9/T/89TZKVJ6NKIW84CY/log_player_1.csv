"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any devaluation on my part. I suggest $40 for me and $60 for you—this way, you secure a larger share today rather than risking a shift later. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm keen to settle quickly too, but I value my share a bit higher. How about $70 for me and $30 for you this round?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but given the inflation hit I'm already taking and the fact that waiting another round might allow me to dial in a fairer split, I'm opting to move to the next round. Let's see if we can craft a proposal that better reflects our respective stakes.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the further impact of inflation on my share in later rounds—and to keep things moving swiftly—I propose a split of $35 for me and $65 for you this round. I believe this offer gives you a solid effective value while avoiding even steeper losses down the road. I hope you agree that settling now is in both of our best interests. Looking forward to your response.""}"
