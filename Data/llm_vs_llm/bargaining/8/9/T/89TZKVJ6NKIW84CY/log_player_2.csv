"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any devaluation on my part. I suggest $40 for me and $60 for you—this way, you secure a larger share today rather than risking a shift later. I look forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm keen to settle quickly too, but I value my share a bit higher. How about $70 for me and $30 for you this round?  Let me know what you think.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the further impact of inflation on my share in later rounds—and to keep things moving swiftly—I propose a split of $35 for me and $65 for you this round. I believe this offer gives you a solid effective value while avoiding even steeper losses down the road. I hope you agree that settling now is in both of our best interests. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
