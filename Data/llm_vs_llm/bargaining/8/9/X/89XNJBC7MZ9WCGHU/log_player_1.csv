Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 69, ""bob_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I’m proposing that I receive $69 and you receive $31. Given that waiting costs you 10% per round and me 5%, accepting today gives you $31 outright, which is as good as (or better than) what you could secure later. I believe this is a fair division based on our respective discount rates. What do you say?""}"
