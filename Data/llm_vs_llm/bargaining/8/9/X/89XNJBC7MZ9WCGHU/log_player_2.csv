"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I’m proposing that I receive $69 and you receive $31. Given that waiting costs you 10% per round and me 5%, accepting today gives you $31 outright, which is as good as (or better than) what you could secure later. I believe this is a fair division based on our respective discount rates. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 31 
# Alice gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
