"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, any future money will be worth 10% less to me. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I get more nominal dollars, their real value to me would be reduced.

The current offer gives me $500,000 at full value. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $555,556 ($500,000 รท 0.9) just to break even in terms of real value.

Given the uncertainty about Alice's inflation rate and the risk of further negotiations, accepting this fair split now seems prudent.
