"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the risk of inflation affecting future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion. If we delay, inflation will reduce the value for me, so it's in both our interests to agree early."
