Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even with the inflation, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 will net me more than waiting for another round where the value decreases further."
