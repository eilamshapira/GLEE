"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to account for the higher inflation rate I'm subject to, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle early to maximize value.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000, aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates we're both facing. The message encourages Bob to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to share, but I believe my contribution is worth more. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual values for us in this round are:
- For me (Alice), 20% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.
- For Bob, 5% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Bob's offer gives me $400,000 out of the $800,000 (considering my inflation rate), which is 50% of the devalued amount I could get, and gives him $600,000 out of the $950,000 (considering his inflation rate), which is approximately 63.2% of what he could get.

Considering the significant disparity in the offer and the fact that I'm facing a much higher inflation rate, which will further reduce my potential gain in subsequent rounds, I should reject this offer. It does not fairly account for my share, given the conditions.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that we're in Round 3, the inflation has further reduced the value of the money:
- For me (Alice), another 20% reduction from the $800,000, which is $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000.
- For Bob, another 5% reduction from the $950,000, which is $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500.

To make an attractive offer that considers the diminishing value and encourages Bob to accept, I'll aim for a more balanced distribution, keeping in mind the different inflation rates we're experiencing.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a fair middle ground before it's too late.""
}
```

This offer gives me $520,000 and Bob $480,000, which, considering the current values after inflation ($640,000 for me and $902,500 for Bob), translates to approximately 81.3% of my potential share and about 53.3% of Bob's potential share. The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the ongoing inflation."
