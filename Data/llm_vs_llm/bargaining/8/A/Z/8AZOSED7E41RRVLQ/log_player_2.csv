"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:
- Alice offered me $4000 and herself $6000
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- Alice faces 10% inflation per round, making future money worth less to her
- I don't face any inflation penalty

Since I can make a counter-offer next round that Alice would be more likely to accept due to her inflation penalty, and I don't suffer any inflation penalty myself, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to her in this round. I should leverage this fact while still being fair enough that she'll accept rather than move to another round where she'd lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500 which, though less than half the total, is still worth more to her now than risking another round of inflation. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's updated offer:
- Alice is now offering me $4500 (up from $4000 in round 1)
- Alice would get $5500 (down from $6000 in round 1)
- Alice faces 19% inflation at this point, so her $5500 is effectively worth only $4455 to her (compared to round 1 value)
- I face no inflation penalty, so my $4500 is still worth full value

If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
- I can make an offer
- Alice will face even more inflation (29%)
- I could potentially get a better deal

However, Alice's current offer is reasonably fair given the circumstances. She's already compromised from her initial position. If I reject, Alice might become more stubborn in future rounds despite her inflation disadvantage.
