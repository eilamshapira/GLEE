"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation
2. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject
3. We have 11 more rounds, but each delay costs me money
4. $400,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we can't agree

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes early agreements more valuable. $400,000 now is better than potentially $500,000 after several rounds of inflation.
