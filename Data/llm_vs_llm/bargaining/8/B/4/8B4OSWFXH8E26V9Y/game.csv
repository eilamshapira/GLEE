53.0,47.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation on my side, I propose an immediate agreement: I receive $53 and you receive $47. This division reflects the slight first‐mover advantage under mutual discounting. I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits us both by locking in today's full value—please let me know if you accept.",Alice,1,
