"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation on my side, I propose an immediate agreement: I receive $53 and you receive $47. This division reflects the slight first‐mover advantage under mutual discounting. I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits us both by locking in today's full value—please let me know if you accept.""}"
