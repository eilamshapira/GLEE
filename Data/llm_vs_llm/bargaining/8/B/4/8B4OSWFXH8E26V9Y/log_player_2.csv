"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation on my side, I propose an immediate agreement: I receive $53 and you receive $47. This division reflects the slight first‐mover advantage under mutual discounting. I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits us both by locking in today's full value—please let me know if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the situation. 

In the first round, the total amount of money is $100, and I'm offered $47. If I reject this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the total amount of money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. 

So, in the next round, the total amount of money would be $100 * 0.8 = $80 for me, but this is only from my perspective, as I don't know how inflation affects Alice. 

Considering this, accepting $47 now might be better than risking further inflation and potentially getting less in the next rounds.
