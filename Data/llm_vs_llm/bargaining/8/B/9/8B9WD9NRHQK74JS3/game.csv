550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, the total amount we can divide gets smaller. This offer gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my disadvantage due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be practical. I understand you're facing inflation, but my time is also valuable. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm now facing 20% inflation on my share. My previous offer was fair considering my disadvantage. Your rejection suggests you're trying to exploit the inflation penalty I face. This new offer accounts for that inflation penalty - if we keep going, we both lose value. Remember, I can reject offers too, and with each round, we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's find a middle ground.  This offer reflects a more balanced approach while acknowledging the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm now facing over 34% inflation on my share. Your last offer of 450k/550k is moving in the right direction, but still doesn't account for my significant disadvantage. If we continue this pattern, we'll reach round 12 and both get nothing. I need a higher share to offset my inflation penalty. This offer is fair considering my effective gain would be approximately 425k at current inflation. Let's end this now before both our shares diminish further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, it's clear we need to settle this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's not risk losing everything.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, my effective gain from your 50/50 offer would only be about 295k due to almost 47% inflation I now face. That's not fair at all. You face no inflation penalty while I lose nearly half my value. We have 5 rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing increases. This offer compensates for my severe inflation disadvantage - my effective gain would be around 370k, which is actually less than your 300k. If you want a deal, you need to acknowledge the asymmetric inflation that only affects me.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. Let's be sensible and end this now before we both end up with nothing.",Bob,8,
