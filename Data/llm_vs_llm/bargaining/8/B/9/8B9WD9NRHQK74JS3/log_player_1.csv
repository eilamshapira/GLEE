Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, the total amount we can divide gets smaller. This offer gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my disadvantage due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be practical. I understand you're facing inflation, but my time is also valuable. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm now facing 20% inflation on my share. My previous offer was fair considering my disadvantage. Your rejection suggests you're trying to exploit the inflation penalty I face. This new offer accounts for that inflation penalty - if we keep going, we both lose value. Remember, I can reject offers too, and with each round, we both risk getting nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5

Your last offer of 450k/550k is moving in the right direction, but still doesn't account for my significant disadvantage. If we continue this pattern, we'll reach round 12 and both get nothing. I need a higher share to offset my inflation penalty. This offer is fair considering my effective gain would be approximately 425k at current inflation. Let's end this now before both our shares diminish further.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 7

That's not fair at all. You face no inflation penalty while I lose nearly half my value. We have 5 rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing increases. This offer compensates for my severe inflation disadvantage - my effective gain would be around 370k, which is actually less than your 300k. If you want a deal, you need to acknowledge the asymmetric inflation that only affects me.""}"

Round 8
