"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, the total amount we can divide gets smaller. This offer gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my disadvantage due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's be practical. I understand you're facing inflation, but my time is also valuable. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now facing 20% inflation on my share. My previous offer was fair considering my disadvantage. Your rejection suggests you're trying to exploit the inflation penalty I face. This new offer accounts for that inflation penalty - if we keep going, we both lose value. Remember, I can reject offers too, and with each round, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now facing over 34% inflation on my share. Your last offer of 450k/550k is moving in the right direction, but still doesn't account for my significant disadvantage. If we continue this pattern, we'll reach round 12 and both get nothing. I need a higher share to offset my inflation penalty. This offer is fair considering my effective gain would be approximately 425k at current inflation. Let's end this now before both our shares diminish further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my effective gain from your 50/50 offer would only be about 295k due to almost 47% inflation I now face. That's not fair at all. You face no inflation penalty while I lose nearly half my value. We have 5 rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing increases. This offer compensates for my severe inflation disadvantage - my effective gain would be around 370k, which is actually less than your 300k. If you want a deal, you need to acknowledge the asymmetric inflation that only affects me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I understand Alice's point about the inflation, but her demands are becoming unreasonable. It's time to push back firmly and see if she's willing to negotiate more realistically."
