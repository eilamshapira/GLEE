4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division that gives you a slight advantage—$5500 for you and $4500 for me—to ensure that you’re well rewarded and to help us lock in the full value before further rounds reduce my share due to inflation. I believe this fair offer is the best way for both of us to secure our interests now.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, thanks for your previous offer. However, I believe a more equitable split is in order.  I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This division reflects a fairer share for each of us, given the potential impact of inflation on future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further reductions.",Bob,2,

1249.0,8751.0,"Hi Bob, the value is rapidly eroding on my end. To avoid further losses, I propose the following split for this round: I take $1249 and you get $8751. With our respective discount rates—my share now being worth 60% of its nominal value and yours 80%—this means you'll effectively get about $7000.8. This is just a bit more than what you’d expect to secure if you waited until the next round (around $7000 effective), so it makes sense for both of us to settle now. Let's agree before even more value disappears.",Alice,3,
