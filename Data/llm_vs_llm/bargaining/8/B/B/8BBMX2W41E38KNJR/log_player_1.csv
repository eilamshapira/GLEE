"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division that gives you a slight advantage—$5500 for you and $4500 for me—to ensure that you’re well rewarded and to help us lock in the full value before further rounds reduce my share due to inflation. I believe this fair offer is the best way for both of us to secure our interests now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your previous offer. However, I believe a more equitable split is in order.  I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This division reflects a fairer share for each of us, given the potential impact of inflation on future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further reductions. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1249, ""bob_gain"": 8751, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, the value is rapidly eroding on my end. To avoid further losses, I propose the following split for this round: I take $1249 and you get $8751. With our respective discount rates—my share now being worth 60% of its nominal value and yours 80%—this means you'll effectively get about $7000.8. This is just a bit more than what you’d expect to secure if you waited until the next round (around $7000 effective), so it makes sense for both of us to settle now. Let's agree before even more value disappears.""}"
