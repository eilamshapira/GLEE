"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. How about we both take $50 each? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject now and propose in the next round, inflation will reduce my share by 10%. So if I were to propose a 60-40 split next round, my $60 would actually be worth $54 due to inflation.

Alice's current offer of $50-50 is fair, and there's risk in rejecting it since:
1. My money will be worth less next round
2. Alice could propose a worse split
3. We have limited rounds before we both get nothing
