"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value for Bob as rounds progress. I'll start with a fair offer, but slightly favoring myself to account for the fact that Bob's money is worth less each round.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $5500 and Bob gets $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for him. Let's analyze this.

*   **My Perspective:** I would get $6000, which is more than my initial proposal.

Given that this is only round 2, and the penalty for reaching round 12 is *nothing*, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
