6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. This ensures we both benefit from this opportunity.,Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, the longer we delay the agreement the more my share loses value—a 10% discount each round hurts me. I know you’re keen on fairness, as shown by your previous offer, so I propose we stick with a 4000/6000 split. Settling now protects both of us from further erosion—please accept this fair division.",Bob,2,

6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about the decreasing value. However, my need for a larger share is genuine. I propose $6400 for me and $3600 for you. This reflects a compromise considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Alice, let’s avoid further losses. If we continue, we both lose more value—especially you, given the steep inflation hit. With this offer, you get $6500 (worth about 64% of its face value, roughly $4160), which is an improvement over your previous effective amount, and I get $3500 (worth about $2835). Settling now safeguards our interests. Please accept this proposal.",Bob,4,
