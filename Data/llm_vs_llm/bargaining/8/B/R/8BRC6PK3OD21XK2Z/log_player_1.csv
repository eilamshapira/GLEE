Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the longer we delay the agreement the more my share loses value—a 10% discount each round hurts me. I know you’re keen on fairness, as shown by your previous offer, so I propose we stick with a 4000/6000 split. Settling now protects both of us from further erosion—please accept this fair division. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let’s avoid further losses. If we continue, we both lose more value—especially you, given the steep inflation hit. With this offer, you get $6500 (worth about 64% of its face value, roughly $4160), which is an improvement over your previous effective amount, and I get $3500 (worth about $2835). Settling now safeguards our interests. Please accept this proposal. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is very close to my previous proposal, and accepting it now prevents further losses due to inflation, especially for me. While ideally, I would have liked a slightly higher share, the difference is minimal considering the circumstances.  Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable outcome for both of us."
