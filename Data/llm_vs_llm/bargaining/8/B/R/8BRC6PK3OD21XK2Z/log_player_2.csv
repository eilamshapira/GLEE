"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. This ensures we both benefit from this opportunity. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, the longer we delay the agreement the more my share loses value—a 10% discount each round hurts me. I know you’re keen on fairness, as shown by your previous offer, so I propose we stick with a 4000/6000 split. Settling now protects both of us from further erosion—please accept this fair division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the decreasing value. However, my need for a larger share is genuine. I propose $6400 for me and $3600 for you. This reflects a compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""Alice, let’s avoid further losses. If we continue, we both lose more value—especially you, given the steep inflation hit. With this offer, you get $6,500 (worth about 64% of its face value, roughly $4,160), which is an improvement over your previous effective amount, and I get $3,500 (worth about $2,835). Settling now safeguards our interests. Please accept this proposal.""}"
