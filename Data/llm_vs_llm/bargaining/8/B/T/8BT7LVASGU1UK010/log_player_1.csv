I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'll see how he responds."

I'm offering Bob a larger share than my previous offer, hoping he'll be more inclined to accept. I'm still prioritizing securing a majority for myself, but I want to avoid the risk of further rounds and potential inflation."

This is a tough one, but the inflation is killing my potential gains. I'm losing too much with each round.  I'll take the offer."
