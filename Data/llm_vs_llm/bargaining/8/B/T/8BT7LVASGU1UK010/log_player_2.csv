"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $902,500 (total possible value)
$200,000 (offer) is approximately 22.2% of the total possible value.

The actual value of the money Alice would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000 (total possible value)
$800,000 (offer) is approximately 125% of the total possible value, which is not possible. However, considering the 36% reduction, the offer of $800,000 is actually $800,000 / 0.64 = $1,250,000 of the original value, which is more than the total amount.

Given the large discrepancy and the fact that Alice's offer seems to be more than the total possible value after inflation, I will reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and we are in round 4, the total reduction for me is:
0.95 (round 1) * 0.95 (round 2) * 0.95 (round 3) * 0.95 (round 4) = 0.8145
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8145 = $814,500 for me.

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so the total reduction for her is:
0.80 (round 1) * 0.80 (round 2) * 0.80 (round 3) * 0.80 (round 4) = 0.4096
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.4096 = $409,600 for Alice.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is:
$300,000 (offer) is approximately 36.8% of the total possible value for me ($814,500, but considering the new inflation rate: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $814,500).

The actual value of the money Alice would gain is:
$700,000 (offer) is approximately 171% of the total possible value for Alice ($409,600, but considering the new inflation rate: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $409,600).

Given that the offer seems to favor Alice, I will reject the offer.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and we are in round 6, the total reduction for me is:
0.95 (round 1) * 0.95 (round 2) * 0.95 (round 3) * 0.95 (round 4) * 0.95 (round 5) * 0.95 (round 6) = 0.774
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.774 = $774,000 for me.

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so the total reduction for her is:
0.80 (round 1) * 0.80 (round 2) * 0.80 (round 3) * 0.80 (round 4) * 0.80 (round 5) * 0.80 (round 6) = 0.2621
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.2621 = $262,100 for Alice.

Considering this, my offer is:
