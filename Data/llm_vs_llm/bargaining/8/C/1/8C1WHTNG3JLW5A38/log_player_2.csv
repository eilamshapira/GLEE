"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split, 50-50. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. A 50-50 split seems fair at first glance
2. However, with inflation affecting my gains in future rounds, accepting now would give me the full value of $50
3. If I reject, my next offer would be worth 5% less to me
4. Alice might be affected by inflation too, but I'm not sure
5. $50 is a reasonable amount, and there's risk in rejection

Given these considerations, especially the certainty of inflation affecting my gains, I'll accept this fair offer.
