"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I need a bit more to cover my needs. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. In the next round, even if I get a larger share, it would be worth less
4. $400,000 in this round is better than $500,000 in the next round (which would be worth $400,000 due to inflation)
5. Further rounds would make it even worse for me due to compounding inflation

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation. If I reject, I might end up with less value due to the 20% inflation penalty.
