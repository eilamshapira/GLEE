"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly even split. This is fair for both of us, and we can both walk away with $5000 right now without risking any potential inflation effects in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which gives us each $5000. This is a fair offer on the surface.

However, I need to account for the inflation effect. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would only be $8000 (due to 20% inflation), so my maximum potential gain would be $8000 if I took everything - which Alice wouldn't accept.

Since $5000 now is better than a risky attempt to get slightly more in the next round (where the best realistic outcome would likely be less due to inflation), I should accept this fair offer.
