"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a fairer split. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? I'm taking the risk of inflation into account. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
