"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a division where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair split that favors me slightly since I'm making the first offer, but still gives Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation factors for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I propose a slightly more balanced division where I get $510,000 and Bob gets $490,000. Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for Bob), it's important that we reach an agreement soon, as delays impact both of us - though me more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
