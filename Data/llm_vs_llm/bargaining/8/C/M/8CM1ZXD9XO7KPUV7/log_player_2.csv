"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance
2. The total amount is $1,000,000
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less for me next round
5. If I reject, my $500,000 would effectively become worth $450,000 in the next round
6. Even if I try to get more in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more to overcome the inflation loss

Given these factors, it's better to accept this fair offer now rather than risk losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds.
