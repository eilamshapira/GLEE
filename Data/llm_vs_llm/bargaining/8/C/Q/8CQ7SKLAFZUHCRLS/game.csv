2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to start negotiations. However, given the heavy inflation penalty you face each round—with every delay costing you 20% of value—it makes sense for you to lock in a good amount now. I'm offering you $2000, which today is worth 20% less but is still better than risking further reductions if we continue to delay. Accepting this offer now secures you a tangible benefit before more value evaporates for you. Let's agree and both maximize our outcomes.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, my previous offer was too high, I understand. However, your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is still beneficial for me, considering inflation, and gives you a larger share than I initially proposed. Think of it as a win-win! Let's secure this before we both lose more to inflation.",Alice,3,

6265.0,3735.0,"Alice, as we both know, further delays will hit you much harder—with only about 51% of the nominal value remaining this round. I've worked out a proposal where our effective payoffs are roughly equal (about $3200 each in today's terms). If we wait, your share will suffer even more due to the 20% per round loss. I believe this fair division in round 4 secures both our interests as we avoid further devaluation. Let's agree now before the value erodes further.",Bob,4,
