Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to start negotiations. However, given the heavy inflation penalty you face each round—with every delay costing you 20% of value—it makes sense for you to lock in a good amount now. I'm offering you $2000, which today is worth 20% less but is still better than risking further reductions if we continue to delay. Accepting this offer now secures you a tangible benefit before more value evaporates for you. Let's agree and both maximize our outcomes. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is still beneficial for me, considering inflation, and gives you a larger share than I initially proposed. Think of it as a win-win! Let's secure this before we both lose more to inflation.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we both know, further delays will hit you much harder—with only about 51% of the nominal value remaining this round. I've worked out a proposal where our effective payoffs are roughly equal (about $3200 each in today's terms). If we wait, your share will suffer even more due to the 20% per round loss. I believe this fair division in round 4 secures both our interests as we avoid further devaluation. Let's agree now before the value erodes further. 
# Alice gain: 6265 
# Bob gain: 3735
