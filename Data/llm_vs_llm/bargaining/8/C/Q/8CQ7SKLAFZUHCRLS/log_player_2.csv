"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a generous offer for me since I'm making the first proposal. It's a fair split considering the inflation difference. We can avoid losing money by agreeing now! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to start negotiations. However, given the heavy inflation penalty you face each round—with every delay costing you 20% of value—it makes sense for you to lock in a good amount now. I'm offering you $2000, which today is worth 20% less but is still better than risking further reductions if we continue to delay. Accepting this offer now secures you a tangible benefit before more value evaporates for you. Let's agree and both maximize our outcomes.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my previous offer was too high, I understand. However, your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is still beneficial for me, considering inflation, and gives you a larger share than I initially proposed. Think of it as a win-win! Let's secure this before we both lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3735, ""alice_gain"": 6265, ""message"": ""Alice, as we both know, further delays will hit you much harder—with only about 51% of the nominal value remaining this round. I've worked out a proposal where our effective payoffs are roughly equal (about $3200 each in today's terms). If we wait, your share will suffer even more due to the 20% per round loss. I believe this fair division in round 4 secures both our interests as we avoid further devaluation. Let's agree now before the value erodes further.""}"
