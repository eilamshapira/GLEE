Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy.

Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. However, since I get to respond first and the money decreases in value by 5% each round, I could try to negotiate for a better deal. In the next round, the total amount would be worth $950,000, and I could propose a split that gives me more.

However, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and even more value loss. The current offer guarantees me $500,000, which is a substantial amount.

Given the risk of losing value through inflation and the possibility of Alice rejecting a more aggressive offer, I think accepting this fair split is the most rational choice.
