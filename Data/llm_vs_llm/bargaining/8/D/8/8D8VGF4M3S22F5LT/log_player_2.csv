"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer.

Alice has proposed:
- $4,000 for me (Bob)
- $6,000 for herself

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% to $9,000. 

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a fair division where we both get a substantial amount. This is more equitable than your initial proposal, and accepting this now would be better than continuing to negotiate while inflation reduces our total."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's new offer.

Alice has proposed:
- $4,500 for me (Bob)
- $5,500 for herself

The total value has decreased by 19% due to inflation, so we're now dividing the equivalent of $8,100.

Alice has improved her offer from the first round, moving closer to an even split. If I reject this, we'll move to round 4 with further depreciation. While I could counter with a better offer for myself, we risk losing more value through continued negotiation.

This is a reasonable offer given the inflation pressure, so I'll accept.
