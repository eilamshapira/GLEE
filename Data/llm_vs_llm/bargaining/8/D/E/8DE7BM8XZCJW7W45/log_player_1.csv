"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider both fairness and the impact of inflation on my gains. Since I'm the first to propose, I'll offer a reasonable division.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair 50-50 split. I'm offering you half of the money, Bob, which I believe is equitable for both of us. Since I know inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me, I'm proposing we conclude this now with an equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider the impact of inflation on my potential gains. If I reject Bob's offer and we go to round 3, any amount I would get would be worth another 20% less to me.

Bob offered me $40, which after the first round of inflation is effectively worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in original value to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, even if I asked for more, it would all be subject to 40% total inflation (20% from round 1 and another 20% from round 2).
