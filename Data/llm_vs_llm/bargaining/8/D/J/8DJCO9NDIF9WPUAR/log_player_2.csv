Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one, considering the inflation. I'm hoping Alice will start to feel the pressure and make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 

This is my final offer. It's a fair 50/50 split, especially considering the money is losing value for me with each round.  If Alice rejects this, I'm willing to risk it all in the final round."
