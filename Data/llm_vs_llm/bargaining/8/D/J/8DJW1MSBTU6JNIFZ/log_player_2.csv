"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 76.43 
# Alice gain: 23.57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale: This is a very favorable offer for me (Bob), offering more than 3/4 of the total amount. While I could try to negotiate for an even better deal, there's a risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds, and Alice might make less favorable offers later. Given that this first offer is already significantly in my favor, it's wise to accept it."
