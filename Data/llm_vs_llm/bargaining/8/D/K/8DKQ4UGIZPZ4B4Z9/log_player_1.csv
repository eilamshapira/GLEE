"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair offer that both Bob and I would be happy with, while recognizing that the money loses value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and allows us both to maximize our gains without risking further inflation."
