"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair here - I propose a 45/55 split. This gives you more than half while being much more equitable than your initial offer. Remember, if you reject, we both lose 10% to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
