"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it, Bob! This is a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

A 90/10 split would give me $100,000 and Alice $900,000. That's quite an uneven split. While Alice is correct about inflation reducing the value by 10% next round, I could still propose a much fairer split if I reject this.

Even with the 10% inflation, the total pot would still be $900,000 next round, and I could propose a more equitable division. A 50/50 split next round would give each of us $450,000, which is significantly better for me than the current $100,000 offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a bit more to encourage acceptance, considering the inflation risk.

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair here - I propose a 45/55 split. This gives you more than half while being much more equitable than your initial offer. Remember, if you reject, we both lose 10% to inflation.""}"
