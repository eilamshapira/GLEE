4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for starting us off. I think a 55/45 split favoring me is more reflective of the risk I'm taking with inflation.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but remember that we both lose everything if we don't agree. I'm offering you $4500 which, even with inflation, is still a substantial amount. This is a more balanced split than my first offer - let's make a deal and ensure we both walk away with something.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, it seems like we're getting caught up in the back and forth. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation impact on my end while still offering you a reasonable sum.  Let's be pragmatic and wrap this up.",Bob,4,
