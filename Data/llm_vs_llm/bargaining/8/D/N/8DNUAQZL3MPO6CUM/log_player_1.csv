"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm taking the initiative to make the first offer. This is a fair proposal that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for starting us off. I think a 55/45 split favoring me is more reflective of the risk I'm taking with inflation.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because the money I gain ($4500) is significantly less than my initial proposal, and I know the inflation doesn't affect my gains. Since Bob is facing inflation pressure, he might be more willing to accept a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but remember that we both lose everything if we don't agree. I'm offering you $4500 which, even with inflation, is still a substantial amount. This is a more balanced split than my first offer - let's make a deal and ensure we both walk away with something.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting caught up in the back and forth. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation impact on my end while still offering you a reasonable sum.  Let's be pragmatic and wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The split is relatively fair (48/52)
2. The $4800 I'm getting is worth the same to me as in round 1
3. Bob is facing significant inflation (48.8% loss), making this deal increasingly urgent for him
4. Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes for both of us
5. We're already in round 4, and with only 12 rounds total, it's wise to secure a reasonable deal"
