"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm taking the initiative to make the first offer. This is a fair proposal that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer isn't terrible, it significantly favors her. Since I don't know how inflation affects her, it's worth risking a counter-offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, knowing that delaying too long will hurt both of us due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting us off. I think a 55/45 split favoring me is more reflective of the risk I'm taking with inflation.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but remember that we both lose everything if we don't agree. I'm offering you $4500 which, even with inflation, is still a substantial amount. This is a more balanced split than my first offer - let's make a deal and ensure we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me, and her offer is now worse than her initial proposal after accounting for my losses. I need to remain firm and signal that I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer share. A significant portion of the remaining rounds needs to involve me making the offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting caught up in the back and forth. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation impact on my end while still offering you a reasonable sum.  Let's be pragmatic and wrap this up.""}"
