"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject this offer and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on my money (while Alice only faces 5% inflation).

This means in the next round, we're effectively dividing:
- For me: $100 × 0.8 = $80 in perceived value
- For Alice: $100 × 0.95 = $95 in perceived value

If I make a counter-offer, I'd need to account for these different inflation rates.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face (20%), even though Alice's offer gives her more, it might be better for me to accept now rather than lose value through inflation.
