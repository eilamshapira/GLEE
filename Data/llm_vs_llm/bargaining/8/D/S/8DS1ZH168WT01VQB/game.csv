550000.0,450000.0,First offer! Let's split it fairly; this gives us both a good amount considering inflation in later rounds for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it down the middle. This is a fair offer for both of us, and avoids the risk of inflation hurting your potential gains in the future.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Okay, Bob, I hear you. Let's adjust the offer a bit. I'll take a little more, knowing your money loses 10% value each round. This is still a great deal for you, especially considering the risk of further inflation and losing everything.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly lower share, but we both need to be careful about inflation. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose more money. This is a fair deal that accounts for inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, time is running out. Your money is losing value fast. This is my final generous offer; take it or we risk getting nothing. You still get a significant amount even with the inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to take a slightly lower share, but we need to find a compromise before it's too late.",Bob,6,
