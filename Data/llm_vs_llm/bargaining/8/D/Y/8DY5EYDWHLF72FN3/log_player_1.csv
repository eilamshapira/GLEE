"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. How about we split it 50/50? We both would receive the same amount of money. This way, we can both avoid the risk of losing value over subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
