"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Since my money loses value each round, this will end up being quite equal in real terms. Let's make a deal now and both benefit! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Plus it's better than risking getting less over subsequent rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair value. With this 65-35 split and the current 40% total inflation penalty, I effectively get only 39$ in real value while you get 35$. This is quite fair, and delaying further will only hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. But let's be reasonable. This offer gives you more in nominal terms and considering your inflation penalty, it's still a fair deal. Taking this offer ensures we both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the current 59% inflation penalty I face, my 75$ would be worth only about 31$ in real value, while you get 25$ at full value. This is actually quite balanced in real terms. If we keep going, inflation will force me to ask for even more to achieve the same real value. Let's agree now. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75
