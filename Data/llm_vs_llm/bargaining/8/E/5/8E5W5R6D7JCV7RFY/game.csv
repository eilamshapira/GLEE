9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing to take $9999 and offer you $1. Remember that as rounds pass, your share will devalue by 20% each time while my share holds steady. Accepting now secures your gain, whereas waiting only hurts your position. Looking forward to a prompt and fair resolution.",Alice,1,

3332.0,6668.0,"Hi Bob, given how quickly your money loses value each round, delaying means you could end up with only 40% of the total in effective terms next round. In this round your money is worth 60% of its face value, so if you accept 6668 now you'll get about 4000.8 in today’s dollars – which is at least as good as what you can secure by waiting. I'm offering this division to reflect the fact that any delay will hurt your outcome significantly. I trust you'll see the advantage of locking in this deal now.",Alice,3,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, considering the significant devaluation for me, I'm making a more generous offer to you. This split acknowledges the decreasing value of my share while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Accepting now could be in both our interests, given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
