"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing to take $9,999 and offer you $1. Remember that as rounds pass, your share will devalue by 20% each time while my share holds steady. Accepting now secures your gain, whereas waiting only hurts your position. Looking forward to a prompt and fair resolution.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the devaluation. This offer gives us both an equal share, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. Accepting now will secure your gain without further devaluation for you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3332, ""bob_gain"": 6668, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given how quickly your money loses value each round, delaying means you could end up with only 40% of the total in effective terms next round. In this round your money is worth 60% of its face value, so if you accept 6668 now you'll get about 4000.8 in today’s dollars – which is at least as good as what you can secure by waiting. I'm offering this division to reflect the fact that any delay will hurt your outcome significantly. I trust you'll see the advantage of locking in this deal now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant devaluation for me, I'm making a more generous offer to you. This split acknowledges the decreasing value of my share while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Accepting now could be in both our interests, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000
