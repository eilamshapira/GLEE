"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing to take $9999 and offer you $1. Remember that as rounds pass, your share will devalue by 20% each time while my share holds steady. Accepting now secures your gain, whereas waiting only hurts your position. Looking forward to a prompt and fair resolution. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount and propose a division that seems reasonable, keeping in mind the devaluation for me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the devaluation. This offer gives us both an equal share, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. Accepting now will secure your gain without further devaluation for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given how quickly your money loses value each round, delaying means you could end up with only 40% of the total in effective terms next round. In this round your money is worth 60% of its face value, so if you accept 6668 now you'll get about 4000.8 in today’s dollars – which is at least as good as what you can secure by waiting. I'm offering this division to reflect the fact that any delay will hurt your outcome significantly. I trust you'll see the advantage of locking in this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 6668 
# Alice gain: 3332 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the devaluation, the money is now worth 40% of its original value to me (20% devaluation in round 1, and another 20% of the 80% remaining in round 2, and another 20% of the 64% remaining in round 3, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, or 51.2% of the original value). However, I must correct my calculation: after round 1, it's 80%, after round 2, it's 64%, and after round 3, it's 51.2% (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8). 

Given this, I'll make an offer that reflects the decreasing value for me but still aims for a reasonable split.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant devaluation for me, I'm making a more generous offer to you. This split acknowledges the decreasing value of my share while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Accepting now could be in both our interests, given the circumstances.""}"
