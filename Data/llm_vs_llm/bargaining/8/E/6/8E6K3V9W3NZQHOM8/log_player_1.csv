"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is reasonable considering we both face inflation, and waiting will reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split it 50/50. With inflation affecting us both, this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $500,000 at 95% value = $475,000 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round:
  - The money will be worth even less (90% for me)
  - Bob will be even more affected (80% for him)
  - This might lead to more difficult negotiations

Since $475,000 is still a substantial amount and further delays will reduce the value significantly for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
