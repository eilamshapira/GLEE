"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that if Bob rejects, inflation will affect my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept this offer of $4,500, it's actually worth $3,600 to me (4500 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my gains will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
3. Bob's current offer is essentially a mirror of my initial offer, which seems fair
4. The inflation penalty makes delaying costly for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty means I should take it now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds."
