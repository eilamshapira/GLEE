Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600}

Explanation: Considering the inflation rate of 10% per round for me, the actual value of the money I receive decreases over time. By round 4, the value has decreased by about 27%. Therefore, I need to secure a higher nominal amount to compensate for this loss. Offering Alice $4600 might be acceptable to her, as it is close to an even split considering the inflation effect on me."
