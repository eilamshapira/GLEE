487200.0,512800.0,"Hi Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose a split that reflects our bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 3, but the overall pie will further shrink. In equilibrium, the best payoff for you as responder in Round 2 is about 48.7% (i.e. $487200) and I receive roughly 51.3% (i.e. $512800). I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances—please accept this offer so we can each secure as much value as possible before further devaluation.",Bob,2,
