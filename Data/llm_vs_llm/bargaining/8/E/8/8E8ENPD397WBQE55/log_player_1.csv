Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split. This way, we can both secure a good amount quickly and avoid further devaluation from inflation in upcoming rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose a split that reflects our bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 3, but the overall pie will further shrink. In equilibrium, the best payoff for you as responder in Round 2 is about 48.7% (i.e. $487200) and I receive roughly 51.3% (i.e. $512800). I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances—please accept this offer so we can each secure as much value as possible before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 487200 
# Bob gain: 512800
