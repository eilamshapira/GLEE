Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split. This way, we can both secure a good amount quickly and avoid further devaluation from inflation in upcoming rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 512800, ""alice_gain"": 487200, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose a split that reflects our bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 3, but the overall pie will further shrink. In equilibrium, the best payoff for you as responder in Round 2 is about 48.7% (i.e. $487,200) and I receive roughly 51.3% (i.e. $512,800). I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances—please accept this offer so we can each secure as much value as possible before further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle with a 52/48 split. Both of us still secure a substantial amount, and it avoids further inflation losses. I hope you find this fair given the reduced total value. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
