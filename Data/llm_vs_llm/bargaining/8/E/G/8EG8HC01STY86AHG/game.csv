600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. I'd like to remind you that if you reject, the total value decreases by 20% for me in the next round, which means we'd be dividing only $800000 in value from my perspective. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing us to maximize the total value of the deal. I think this is fair considering the inflation penalty.",Alice,1,
