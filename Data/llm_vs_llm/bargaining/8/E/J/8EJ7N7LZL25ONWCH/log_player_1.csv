"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600. 

Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less in each round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4500 * (1 - 0.271) = $4500 * 0.729 = $3280.50.

Considering this, I think the offer is still not very favorable to me, but I also need to consider that the value of the money will keep decreasing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less in each round, so it's worth approximately 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer, trying to be more generous to Bob, while also considering the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
