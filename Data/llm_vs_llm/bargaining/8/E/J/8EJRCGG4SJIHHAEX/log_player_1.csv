"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $10,000. I want to account for the inflation that affects me and also make an offer Bob is likely to accept.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Greed vs. Acceptance:** I am offering myself slightly more, as I am the proposer and want to secure a decent amount. However, I'm also aware that a grossly unfair offer will likely be rejected.
*   **Bob's Incentive:** Bob receives a substantial $4500, which might be enticing enough for him to accept in the first round, especially since he might not know how the inflation affects me.

I hope Bob accepts!"
