"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since inflation is 10% per round for me, if I reject and move to the next round, the total value to me would be reduced. Let's see:

If I accept now: I get $4,500
If I reject and propose in the next round: The total pot would be worth $9,000 to me, and I'd have to make Alice an offer that she'd accept.

While the current split isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable first offer that gives me 45% of the total. Considering the inflation risk and that we have many rounds potentially ahead, this seems like a fair starting point.
