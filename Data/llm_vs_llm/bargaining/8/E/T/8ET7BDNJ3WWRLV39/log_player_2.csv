"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60 out of the total $100.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, due to the 20% inflation penalty, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me in the next round. This means even if I proposed to take all $100 in the next round (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum potential gain would be worth $80.

Since $40 now is worth more than potentially getting more money that's subject to inflation in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
