8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I know time is moneyâ€”literally. With each round, my share loses a bit of its value, and I want to avoid further depreciation. I'm offering you $8000 now, leaving me with $2000, in order to wrap this up quickly. I believe this generous offer makes sense so that we can both avoid additional losses. What do you say?",Bob,2,
