"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know time is moneyâ€”literally. With each round, my share loses a bit of its value, and I want to avoid further depreciation. I'm offering you $8000 now, leaving me with $2000, in order to wrap this up quickly. I believe this generous offer makes sense so that we can both avoid additional losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
