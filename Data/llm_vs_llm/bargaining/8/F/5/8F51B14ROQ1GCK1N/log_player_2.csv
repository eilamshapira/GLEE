"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'll take 90% and you get 10%. It's a good deal considering we only have 12 rounds and inflation is a killer! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know time is moneyâ€”literally. With each round, my share loses a bit of its value, and I want to avoid further depreciation. I'm offering you $8000 now, leaving me with $2000, in order to wrap this up quickly. I believe this generous offer makes sense so that we can both avoid additional losses. What do you say?""}"
