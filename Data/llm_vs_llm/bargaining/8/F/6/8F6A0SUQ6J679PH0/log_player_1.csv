"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my perspective. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I need to account for the 5% reduction in the value of the money.

Given the offer from Bob:
*   Alice gain: $4500

I should accept this offer as the value of money for Alice is lower because of inflation.
