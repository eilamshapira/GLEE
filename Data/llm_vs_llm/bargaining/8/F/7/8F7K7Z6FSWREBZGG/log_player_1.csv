"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make a proposal to Bob. I need to be mindful of inflation, which devalues my potential earnings by 20% each round. I don't know how inflation affects Bob, so I'll assume he is rational and wants to maximize his gain.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting with a larger share for myself (60%), acknowledging the risk of inflation affecting me.
*   Offering Bob 40% of the initial sum gives him a significant incentive to accept the offer. If the inflation is affecting him he should accept.
*   This split should be attractive enough to avoid another round, which would cost me 20% of my potential gain."
