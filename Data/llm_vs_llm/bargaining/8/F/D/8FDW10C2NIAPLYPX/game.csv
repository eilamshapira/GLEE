100.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I take the full $100 while you get $0. I know it might seem harsh, but if you decline and become the proposer in the next round, the money you get will be worth 20% less due to inflation. So accepting now is just as good for you as waiting. What do you say?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I know the money is worth the same to you in every round, but for me, it's losing value fast. I think 60-40 is a fair split considering the inflation. If you reject, I'll have to offer less in the next round to make up for the loss in value.",Bob,2,

99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, it's round 3. Listen, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4—but because of the inflation, any money you hold then is worth only 40% of its nominal value, and I’ll have all the bargaining power. In equilibrium, your best alternative is effectively nothing. So I'm offering you $1 (which, even discounted at 60%, is worth more than what you'll get later) while I claim $99. I believe this is the smartest move for both of us—no further delay and no more loss in value for you. What do you say?",Alice,3,
