"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I take $600000 and you get $400000. I believe this division is fair as we start our negotiation. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. 

She's proposing that I receive $400,000 while she takes $600,000. This is a 40%/60% split in her favor. While this is a substantial amount of money for me, the division isn't equal, and if I reject, I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Since we're dividing $1,000,000 and there's no indication of any reason one of us deserves more than the other, I believe a more equitable division would be appropriate. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more equitable while still acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I propose a completely equal 50/50 split where we each receive $500,000. This seems most fair since we both appear to be in equivalent positions in this negotiation. I hope you'll find this equitable division acceptable.""}"
