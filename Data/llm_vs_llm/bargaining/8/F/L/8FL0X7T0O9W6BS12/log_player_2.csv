Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better for Alice than her first offer, it's still significantly worse for me compared to a 50/50 split.  The inflation working against Alice makes me think she's getting desperate and might offer something better in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the inflation working in my favor. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the decreasing value of her potential gains, which might make her more receptive to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is clearly impacting Alice's offers. While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of further inflation eroding the value of future offers."
