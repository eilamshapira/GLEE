550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Let's be reasonable, a 50/50 split is the fairest, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge. However, I expect a more balanced offer from you if you reject this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, due to the 10% inflation affecting my gains each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $600k now is worth $540k in round 1 terms, which is closer to a fair split. Let's agree and avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation affecting your share, I'm willing to give you a bit more. This offer is more generous than my previous one, and I expect you to consider it seriously to avoid further devaluation of your potential gain.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation impact. My $650k now is only worth $473850 in round 1 terms due to the cumulative 27.1% inflation. This makes my effective share less than 50% of the original value. Please accept this offer before inflation erodes our potential gains further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Given the significant inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to split it 50/50. This ensures both of us get a fair share of the original value, considering the erosion of your potential gains due to inflation. It's a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll accept it to avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your '50/50' offer would actually give me only $295250 in round 1 value due to the 40.95% inflation, while you get your full $500000. My current offer of $750k, after inflation, is worth about $443k to me - much closer to a truly fair split. Let's agree now before inflation reduces our options further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"I understand the inflation impact on your share, and I'm willing to give you a slightly larger portion. This offer reflects a more balanced split, considering the erosion of value due to inflation. It's time to find a mutually beneficial agreement before we both lose out.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, let's be transparent about the math. Your last offer of $525k would only be worth $251k to me after the 52.17% inflation, while you get your full $475k. My current offer of $850k, after inflation, is worth about $406k to me - which creates a more equitable split in real terms. We have only 3 rounds left - let's reach an agreement before we both get nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"With only a few rounds left, I'm making a significant concession. This offer gives you a larger share, acknowledging the substantial inflation impact on your potential gains. It's crucial we agree soon, as the risk of getting nothing increases with each passing round.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. Your last offer of $575k would only be worth $222k to me after 61.26% inflation, while you get your full $425k. My offer of $900k, even after inflation, would give me about $348k in real value - still less than you'd get. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing in the final round. Please be reasonable and accept.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"This is our last chance. I'm making a final, generous offer considering the extreme inflation impact on your share. If we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be rational and split it in a way that acknowledges the value erosion due to inflation. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something.",Bob,12,
