"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, a 50/50 split is the fairest, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge. However, I expect a more balanced offer from you if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 10% inflation for me, the $475,000 would only be worth $427,500 in round 1 terms. This is significantly less than what I offered Bob, and since he rejected a more generous offer, I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation affecting my gains each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $600k now is worth $540k in round 1 terms, which is closer to a fair split. Let's agree and avoid further inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting your share, I'm willing to give you a bit more. This offer is more generous than my previous one, and I expect you to consider it seriously to avoid further devaluation of your potential gain. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 27.1% inflation, the $450,000 would only be worth about $328,050 in round 1 terms. This is even worse than Bob's previous offer, and he's actually offering me less nominal amount than before. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation impact. My $650k now is only worth $473,850 in round 1 terms due to the cumulative 27.1% inflation. This makes my effective share less than 50% of the original value. Please accept this offer before inflation erodes our potential gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to split it 50/50. This ensures both of us get a fair share of the original value, considering the erosion of your potential gains due to inflation. It's a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll accept it to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 40.95% inflation, the $500,000 would only be worth about $295,250 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets his full $500,000. This ""50/50"" split is actually very unfair when accounting for inflation. I need to counter with a higher nominal amount to achieve a more equitable split in real terms."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Bob, your '50/50' offer would actually give me only $295,250 in round 1 value due to the 40.95% inflation, while you get your full $500,000. My current offer of $750k, after inflation, is worth about $443k to me - much closer to a truly fair split. Let's agree now before inflation reduces our options further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impact on your share, and I'm willing to give you a slightly larger portion. This offer reflects a more balanced split, considering the erosion of value due to inflation. It's time to find a mutually beneficial agreement before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 52.17% inflation, the $525,000 would only be worth about $251,108 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets his full $475,000. This offer is actually worse in real terms than his previous offers. The gap between nominal and real values is growing significantly, and I need to counter with an even higher nominal amount to achieve fair value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be transparent about the math. Your last offer of $525k would only be worth $251k to me after the 52.17% inflation, while you get your full $475k. My current offer of $850k, after inflation, is worth about $406k to me - which creates a more equitable split in real terms. We have only 3 rounds left - let's reach an agreement before we both get nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With only a few rounds left, I'm making a significant concession. This offer gives you a larger share, acknowledging the substantial inflation impact on your potential gains. It's crucial we agree soon, as the risk of getting nothing increases with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 61.26% inflation, the $575,000 would only be worth about $222,755 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets his full $425,000. Despite Bob claiming this is a ""significant concession,"" it's actually worse in real terms than most of his previous offers. With only two rounds left, I need to make one more attempt at a fair split that accounts for the severe inflation impact."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. Your last offer of $575k would only be worth $222k to me after 61.26% inflation, while you get your full $425k. My offer of $900k, even after inflation, would give me about $348k in real value - still less than you'd get. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing in the final round. Please be reasonable and accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. I'm making a final, generous offer considering the extreme inflation impact on your share. If we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be rational and split it in a way that acknowledges the value erosion due to inflation. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): While $600,000 after 68.62% inflation is only worth about $188,280 in round 1 terms (compared to Bob's full $400,000), this is the final round. If I reject this offer, we both get nothing. Some gain is better than no gain, so I must accept despite the unfavorable terms."
