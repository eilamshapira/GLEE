"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 400,000$ in the first round. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, but 20% less to Alice. This gives me some negotiating leverage since she loses value faster than I do.

Starting with a 60-40 split in her favor seems a bit unfair when I could potentially negotiate for a more equal split. Given that I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer and Alice will lose more value than me in the next round, I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice loses value faster than I do (20% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more balanced split, but still leave room for negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair with a 50-50 split. This is better for both of us than letting the money depreciate further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 proposal 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice's first offer was 400k for me, my counter was 500k, and now she's offering 420k
2. Due to inflation, the 420k is actually worth about 379k to me (420k * 0.9025)
3. If I reject, the next round will have another 5% depreciation for me and 20% for Alice
4. Her 580k is already worth significantly less to her due to the 36% depreciation
5. She's more pressured to make a deal soon due to her higher depreciation rate

Given that my negotiating position strengthens each round due to the asymmetric depreciation, and that her current offer is still quite far from a fair split, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money depreciates much faster than mine (she's already at 36% loss vs my 9.75%), I'm in a stronger negotiating position. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk multiple more rounds of rejection. I'll propose a split that's better than her last offer but still gives her a significant portion.

{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Given the faster depreciation rate you face, this is a fair offer that gives you a majority while protecting both our interests. Let's conclude this now before further depreciation.""}"
