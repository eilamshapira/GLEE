"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing value through inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation hits you much harder than me. I propose 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures you lose less to inflation overall and is a much better deal for you in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation difference gives Bob negotiating leverage, but a 60/40 split in his favor is too extreme. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round, considering that I need to act relatively quickly due to the higher inflation rate affecting me."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, while you're right about inflation affecting me more, a 50-50 split is the fairest solution and will give us both a good outcome. Let's not waste more time and risk further losses - this is a perfectly balanced deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but the reality is that time is working against you more than me. How about a compromise? I'll take 57% and you take 43%. It's still a significant amount of money for you, and we can both walk away with a win. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, Bob is correct that time works against me more strongly due to the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs his 5% per round). If we continue negotiating, my share will be worth significantly less, and Bob's position will only strengthen. A 43% share now is better than risking further rounds of inflation."
