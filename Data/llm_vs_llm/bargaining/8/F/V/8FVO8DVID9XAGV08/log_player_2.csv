"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing value through inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it heavily skewed in her favor. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation hits you much harder than me. I propose 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures you lose less to inflation overall and is a much better deal for you in the long run.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while you're right about inflation affecting me more, a 50-50 split is the fairest solution and will give us both a good outcome. Let's not waste more time and risk further losses - this is a perfectly balanced deal. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate and trying to frame a 50/50 split as ""fair"" even though the longer this goes on, the more she stands to lose compared to me. I need to hold firm and aim for a better split, but I should consider being slightly less aggressive in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 570000,
""alice_gain"": 430000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but the reality is that time is working against you more than me. How about a compromise? I'll take 57% and you take 43%. It's still a significant amount of money for you, and we can both walk away with a win.""}"
