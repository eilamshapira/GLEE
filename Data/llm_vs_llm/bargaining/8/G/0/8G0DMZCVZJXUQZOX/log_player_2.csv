"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is the fairest solution for both of us, and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $5,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   - So the maximum I could get would be worth $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9)
   - And Alice might reject that anyway

A 50-50 split is a fair offer, and given the inflation penalty, it's likely better to accept now than risk getting less value in future rounds, even if I could potentially negotiate for more.
