Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a split where I receive $53 and you get $47. Considering the 10% devaluation I face with each round and our mutual interest in concluding quickly, this offer reflects a fair and balanced division given our circumstances. I hope you agree so we can both avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, the $47 offered would actually be worth $37.60 to me (47 * 0.8).
If I reject and we go to another round, any amount would be worth even less (another 20% reduction).

In the first round, I proposed getting $60 which Bob rejected.
The current offer gives me less, but considering the heavy inflation penalty I face, waiting for a better deal would likely result in even less value for me.
