"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, every round you wait costs you 5% in value while I lose nothing. If you reject this offer, you risk ending up with nothing in the next round. Accept this division and secure your $1 now rather than face a devalued tomorrow.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand there's inflation, but I believe we should split it more fairly. This way, I still get a substantial amount while you still benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Bob, every round you wait, your money loses an extra 5%—in fact, if you reject now you'll have to propose in round 4, where your dollars will be worth only 85% of their face value. I'm offering you $10,000 nominal (worth $9,000 effective today), which is far better than the near‐nothing you'd get by delaying further. Let's settle now and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
