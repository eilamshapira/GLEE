"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, every round you wait costs you 5% in value while I lose nothing. If you reject this offer, you risk ending up with nothing in the next round. Accept this division and secure your $1 now rather than face a devalued tomorrow. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 950000,""alice_gain"": 50000,""message"": ""Alice, I understand there's inflation, but I believe we should split it more fairly. This way, I still get a substantial amount while you still benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, every round you wait, your money loses an extra 5%—in fact, if you reject now you'll have to propose in round 4, where your dollars will be worth only 85% of their face value. I'm offering you $10000 nominal (worth $9000 effective today), which is far better than the near‐nothing you'd get by delaying further. Let's settle now and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
