"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial proposal for dividing the $100, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement now.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a fair portion while acknowledging that I have an incentive to reach an agreement in this round due to inflation affecting my gains in future rounds."
