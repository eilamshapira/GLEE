It's early in the game, and although Alice's offer considers inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. It's still early in the game, and this way we both get a fair share. Considering the inflation on my part, this deal is beneficial for you too.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. This offer gives you a bit more to compensate for the future rounds, but also considers my position. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, and although it considers inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. With 9 rounds left, I'm willing to take more risk."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the inflation. However, this offer is still generous to you. We have plenty of rounds left, so let's find a fair middle ground.""}

I'm starting to be more aggressive to compensate for the inflation, I have lost 36% of my money power already."
