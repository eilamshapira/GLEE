"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 65-35 split. Since you face 5% inflation per round, taking this offer now is better than getting more in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $35 for me, $65 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round's $100 will be worth $95 to me due to 5% inflation
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but Alice might reject it
4. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the 5% inflation means I need to get more than $36.84 ($35/0.95) to make waiting worthwhile

While the split isn't exactly fair, Alice makes a valid point about inflation working against me. If I reject, I need to get significantly more in the next round to overcome the inflation penalty, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept such a proposal.
