"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50-50 split is the fairest solution. If you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us next round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $500,000, but due to the 10% decrease in value, it's effectively worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and it's now the third round, I need to consider that when making my offer.

In the first round, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In the second round, the money was worth 90% of its value to me.
In the third round, the money is worth 80% of its value to me (90% * 0.9).

For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round:
In the first round, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In the second round, the money was worth 80% of its value to Bob.
In the third round, the money is worth 64% of its value to Bob (80% * 0.8).

With that in mind, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, let's make a deal before it's too late""}"
