"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000
2. If I reject, next round:
   - The money's value decreases 20% for me (worth 800,000$)
   - The money's value decreases 10% for Alice (worth 900,000$)
   - I get to make the proposal

A 60/40 split in Alice's favor isn't particularly fair when we're starting with equal positions. If I reject, I can propose a better split next round, even accounting for the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since the money is now worth 800,000$ to me and 900,000$ to Alice, I need to account for this depreciation while making a fair offer that Alice would accept.

If Alice rejects my offer, in the next round:
- Money will be worth 640,000$ to me (another 20% drop)
- Money will be worth 810,000$ to Alice (another 10% drop)

I should offer a split that's better for Alice than what she would get in the next round if she rejects.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""A 50-50 split is the fairest solution. If you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value, let's make a deal before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: I get $350,000
   - With 36% depreciation, this is worth $224,000 in round 1 value

2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 48.8% less for me (worth about $512,000)
   - Next round money will be worth 27.1% less for Alice (worth about $729,000)
   - I get to make the proposal

Alice's offer is actually worse than her first offer when accounting for depreciation. If I reject, the depreciation is getting severe, but I still have one more chance to make a better proposal.

However, the rate of depreciation is accelerating and working against me more than Alice. If my next proposal is rejected, the money will be worth very little to me.

Given the rapidly decreasing value and the risk of further rounds, I should accept this offer.
