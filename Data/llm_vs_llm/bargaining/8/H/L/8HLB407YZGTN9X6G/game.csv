60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair division for both of us. How about I take $60 and you take $40?,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand you want a favorable split, but I need to consider the inflation penalty I face with each round. I'm proposing a $55/$45 split in my favor, which is fair considering I already lost 10% value by waiting for this round. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose even more value due to inflation, so this proposal makes economic sense for both of us.",Bob,2,
