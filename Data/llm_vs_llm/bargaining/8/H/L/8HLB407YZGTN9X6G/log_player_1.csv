Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,""bob_gain"": 40,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair division for both of us. How about I take $60 and you take $40?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you want a favorable split, but I need to consider the inflation penalty I face with each round. I'm proposing a $55/$45 split in my favor, which is fair considering I already lost 10% value by waiting for this round. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose even more value due to inflation, so this proposal makes economic sense for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
