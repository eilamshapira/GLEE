"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division for both of us. How about I take $60 and you take $40? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's first offer. She's proposing that she takes $60 and I take $40.

I need to be mindful of inflation - with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me. If I reject this offer, any future amount I receive will be worth less due to this 10% inflation penalty per round.

While $40 isn't half of the pot, if I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I could get more in the next round, it would be subject to 10% inflation for me. So $50 in the next round would actually be worth $45 to me (50 Ã— 0.9).

Given this inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer but need to be strategic about my counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a balanced offer that considers both our interests while accounting for the inflation effect on my end.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you want a favorable split, but I need to consider the inflation penalty I face with each round. I'm proposing a $55/$45 split in my favor, which is fair considering I already lost 10% value by waiting for this round. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose even more value due to inflation, so this proposal makes economic sense for both of us.""}"
