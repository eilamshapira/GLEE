"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself because I face higher inflation (20% vs 10% per round), so I need more compensation upfront. This is still quite fair to Bob as he gets a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4000, but it's worth 20% less than in round 1, so effectively $3200
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but everything will be worth even less
- Bob is offering himself more than half, and with my higher inflation rate, this is particularly unfavorable to me
- However, prolonging the negotiation will reduce the real value significantly for both of us

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too unfavorable given my higher inflation rate. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, I need to consider that:
1. My gains are worth 40% less than round 1
2. Bob's gains are worth 20% less than round 1
3. Further delays will hurt both of us, but me more than Bob

Let me make a more urgent compromise:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm asking for a larger share to compensate for my higher inflation rate, but still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob should be motivated to accept rather than letting more rounds pass. This offer would give Bob $4200 at 20% depreciation, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount in later rounds with more depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept now:
- I get $4500, but it's worth 48.8% less, so effectively about $2304
- Bob gets $5500 at 27.1% depreciation, so effectively about $4009

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 59% less than round 1
- Bob's money will be worth 34.4% less
- The gap keeps widening due to different inflation rates

The offer is better than the previous one, and given the accelerating losses from inflation, especially on my side, prolonging this further would significantly hurt both of us.
