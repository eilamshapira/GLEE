"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Since she made the first offer, if I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round.

The important factor here is the asymmetric inflation - my money doesn't lose value over rounds, but Alice's money loses 10% value each round. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

If I reject and make a better offer in round 2, Alice will only get 90% value of whatever dollar amount we agree on. This puts pressure on her to accept reasonable offers sooner rather than later.

I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation Alice faces while remaining fair.

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, and we're now in round 2, any dollars she receives are worth only 90% of their original value to her. This means I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice a deal that's better than waiting for future rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I think this is fair because if Alice rejects this offer, her next counter-offer would need to account for another 10% inflation on her side. I'm offering a reasonable improvement on my position while still giving Alice a substantial portion that's worth more to her now than later."
