40.0,60.0,"Alice, I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking a slight lead since I'm the one proposing now.  This way, we can both still walk away with a good amount, and avoid further inflation losses.",Bob,2,

62.0,38.0,"Bob, I understand your counter in the previous round. However, given the continuing inflation, I need to account for the losses I'm incurring. Let's do 62/38. This accounts for the fact that the money is worth less to me now. This is a fair and hopefully agreeable offer before we lose even more value. Think about it, you still get $38 for free!",Alice,3,
