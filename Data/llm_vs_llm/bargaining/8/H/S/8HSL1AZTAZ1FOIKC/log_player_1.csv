Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking a slight lead since I'm the one proposing now.  This way, we can both still walk away with a good amount, and avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

This accounts for the fact that the money is worth less to me now. This is a fair and hopefully agreeable offer before we lose even more value. Think about it, you still get $38 for free!""
