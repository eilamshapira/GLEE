"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 55/45. This is a fair offer, and we both walk away with a good amount. Let's avoid further inflation losses and agree now!

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking a slight lead since I'm the one proposing now.  This way, we can both still walk away with a good amount, and avoid further inflation losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your counter in the previous round. However, given the continuing inflation, I need to account for the losses I'm incurring. Let's do 62/38. This accounts for the fact that the money is worth less to me now. This is a fair and hopefully agreeable offer before we lose even more value. Think about it, you still get $38 for free! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
