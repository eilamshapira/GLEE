"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept and avoid inflation affecting my share.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk losing value to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $40, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $36 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- Bob's position is stronger since inflation doesn't affect him

Given that inflation will continue to erode my purchasing power in future rounds, and that I'm already at a disadvantage, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in the next round.
