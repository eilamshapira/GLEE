"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. My money doesn't lose value over rounds (0% inflation for me)
4. This is a decent offer, but I could potentially get more

Since I don't lose value over rounds and I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a slightly more favorable proposal for myself while still keeping it reasonable enough for Alice to potentially accept:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a better share than Alice's initial proposal while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion. Since I know I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in my negotiation."
