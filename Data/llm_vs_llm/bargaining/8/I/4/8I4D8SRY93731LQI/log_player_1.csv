Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split it $60 for me and $40 for you. I think it's a fair start. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think an equal 50-50 split would be most fair for both of us. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid further rounds that would reduce the total amount through inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
