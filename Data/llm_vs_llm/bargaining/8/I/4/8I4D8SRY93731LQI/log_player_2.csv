"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it $60 for me and $40 for you. I think it's a fair start. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's proposal carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 10% less (so $90 total).

Since this is the first round, I believe I should try for a more equal split, especially since I'll have the opportunity to make the next proposal if I reject this one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we're under.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think an equal 50-50 split would be most fair for both of us. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid further rounds that would reduce the total amount through inflation.""}"
