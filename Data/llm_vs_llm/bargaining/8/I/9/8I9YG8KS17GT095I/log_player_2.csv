"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair. However, I know that if I reject, I can make my own offer next round.

The downside of rejecting is that my share will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation. If I propose something like 60-40 in my favor next round, even with the 5% inflation, I would get: 60 * 0.95 = 57$, which is better than the current 50$.

However, Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation, potentially leaving both of us with nothing after 12 rounds.

Given these considerations, I think the 50-50 split is actually a reasonable offer, and the risk of escalating negotiations isn't worth the potential small gain.
