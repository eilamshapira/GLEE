5000.0,5000.0,"Given the inflation, let's make this fair and square, 50/50. We both benefit equally and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,

5001.0,4999.0,"Alice, I understand the pressures of inflation on your share. If we delay further, your effective value will drop even more. To avoid that risk, I'm offering a deal that gives you a tiny edge – a nominal 50/50 split (with 5001 for you versus 4999 for me), ensuring you receive slightly more than what waiting would yield. Let's settle now and secure our gains.",Bob,4,
