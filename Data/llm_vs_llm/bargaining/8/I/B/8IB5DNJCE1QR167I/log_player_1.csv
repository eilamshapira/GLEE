Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressures of inflation on your share. If we delay further, your effective value will drop even more. To avoid that risk, I'm offering a deal that gives you a tiny edge – a nominal 50/50 split (with 5001 for you versus 4999 for me), ensuring you receive slightly more than what waiting would yield. Let's settle now and secure our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5001 
# Bob gain: 4999
