Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, let's make this fair and square, 50/50. We both benefit equally and avoid further losses.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4999, ""alice_gain"": 5001, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressures of inflation on your share. If we delay further, your effective value will drop even more. To avoid that risk, I'm offering a deal that gives you a tiny edge – a nominal 50/50 split (with 5001 for you versus 4999 for me), ensuring you receive slightly more than what waiting would yield. Let's settle now and secure our gains.""}"
