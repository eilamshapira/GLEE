"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of our $1,000,000 total.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I were to get a higher percentage in the next round, it might be worth rejecting. However, Alice might also reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount (40% of the total), and considering the risk of inflation with further rounds, I'll accept this offer.
