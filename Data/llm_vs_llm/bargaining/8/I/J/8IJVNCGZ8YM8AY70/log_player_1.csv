"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I want to start with a somewhat favorable offer, but still leave Bob with a significant portion to encourage acceptance. I need to factor in the potential for inflation in future rounds, so getting a larger share now seems prudent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
