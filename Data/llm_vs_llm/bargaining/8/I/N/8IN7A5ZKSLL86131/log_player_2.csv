"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less for me (multiplier 0.8)
   * Money will be worth 5% less for Alice (multiplier 0.95)
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject

3. If I reject and we go another round:
   * My $400,000 would become worth $320,000 (20% less)
   * Alice's $600,000 would become worth $570,000 (5% less)

Given the significant depreciation rate for me (20%) compared to Alice's (5%), and considering that $400,000 is a substantial amount, I should probably accept this offer. If I reject, the rapid depreciation for me makes it risky to negotiate further.
