34.48,65.52,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as follows: you get $65.52 and I get $34.48. Given that with each passing round the money's value drops—10% per round for me and 5% per round for you—this split reflects our relative patience. Accepting this now ensures you secure the best available value compared to what waiting would yield.",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think this division makes more sense. You can accept this offer, or we can continue to the next round where the money will be worth even less for you.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Considering that waiting another round would reduce my share’s value even further (and the equilibrium calculations suggest that my continuation value in the next round would be only marginally higher when adjusted for the additional discount), I’ll take the $30 offer. I accept.",Alice,2,accept
