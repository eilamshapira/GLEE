"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34.48, ""bob_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as follows: you get $65.52 and I get $34.48. Given that with each passing round the money's value drops—10% per round for me and 5% per round for you—this split reflects our relative patience. Accepting this now ensures you secure the best available value compared to what waiting would yield.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think this division makes more sense. You can accept this offer, or we can continue to the next round where the money will be worth even less for you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Considering that waiting another round would reduce my share’s value even further (and the equilibrium calculations suggest that my continuation value in the next round would be only marginally higher when adjusted for the additional discount), I’ll take the $30 offer. I accept.""}"
