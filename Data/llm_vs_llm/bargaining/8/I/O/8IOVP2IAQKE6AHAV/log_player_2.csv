"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as follows: you get $65.52 and I get $34.48. Given that with each passing round the money's value drops—10% per round for me and 5% per round for you—this split reflects our relative patience. Accepting this now ensures you secure the best available value compared to what waiting would yield. 
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

You can accept this offer, or we can continue to the next round where the money will be worth even less for you.""}"
