"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, this $4000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for a potentially better offer later when inflation will reduce its value. This is a fair offer accounting for our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
