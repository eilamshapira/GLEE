"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has proposed an even split of $5,000 for each of us. While this is fair in absolute terms, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since money doesn't lose value for me across rounds but loses 20% value per round for Alice, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds.

If I reject now and propose in the next round, Alice will face a 20% devaluation, meaning her $5,000 would effectively be worth $4,000 to her. This gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, this $4,000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for a potentially better offer later when inflation will reduce its value. This is a fair offer accounting for our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 4000 to make it worthwhile considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me $5,500 while taking $4,500 herself, which is a compromise from her initial proposal. I need to evaluate this strategically:

1. Her money loses value each round (now worth 36% less)
2. If I reject, we move to round 4, where her money will be worth 44% less
3. Her $4,500 at 36% inflation is actually worth about $2,880 to her
4. If I counter-offer in round 4, I could potentially get more, but risk further rounds of negotiation

Since I can get $5,500 now with certainty, and Alice has moved significantly in my direction while still offering me a majority share, this is a reasonable deal.
