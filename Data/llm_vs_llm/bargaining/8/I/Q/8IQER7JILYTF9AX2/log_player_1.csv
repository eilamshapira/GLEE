Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer given the inflation risk.

I suggest we split the money equally. A fair 50-50 division gives us each $5,000, which seems reasonable in the first round. The longer we negotiate, the more value I lose due to inflation, so I believe this is a balanced starting point that should be acceptable to both of us."
