526316.0,473684.0,"Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal. I suggest allocating $526316 to me and $473684 to you. This offer reflects our discounting: if you reject and wait until the next round (where the total is worth 10% less), you would expect to secure about $473684. Accepting now secures you the same value immediately. What do you say?",Alice,1,

473684.0,526316.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal. Since we're in round 2, I'm proposing $526316 for me and $473684 for you. This division aligns with where you started in round 1, considering the new total value after discounting. Let me know what you think!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for the offer. Given that rejecting would mean moving to round 3 with even steeper discounting (and my position as proposer in round 3 would net me roughly 52.63% of an even smaller pot), your offer of $473684 (in round 2 value) is better than the alternative. I accept your proposal.",Alice,2,accept
