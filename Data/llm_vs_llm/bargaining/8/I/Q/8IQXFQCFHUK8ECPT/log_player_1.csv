Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 526316, ""bob_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal. I suggest allocating $526,316 to me and $473,684 to you. This offer reflects our discounting: if you reject and wait until the next round (where the total is worth 10% less), you would expect to secure about $473,684.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal. Since we're in round 2, I'm proposing $526316 for me and $473684 for you. This division aligns with where you started in round 1, considering the new total value after discounting. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 473684 
# Bob gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for the offer. Given that rejecting would mean moving to round 3 with even steeper discounting (and my position as proposer in round 3 would net me roughly 52.63% of an even smaller pot), your offer of $473,684 (in round 2 value) is better than the alternative. I accept your proposal.""}"
