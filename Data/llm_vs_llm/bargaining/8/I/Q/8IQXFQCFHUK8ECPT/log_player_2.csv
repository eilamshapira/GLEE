"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal. I suggest allocating $526316 to me and $473684 to you. This offer reflects our discounting: if you reject and wait until the next round (where the total is worth 10% less), you would expect to secure about $473684. Accepting now secures you the same value immediately. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
