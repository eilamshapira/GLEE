"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I should account for the inflation penalties:

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2:
- For me (Bob), the money will be worth 10% less
- For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less

This means if I reject, I'll be dealing with $90 of effective value (for me) in the next round, while Alice will be dealing with $95 of effective value.

Since Alice offered an equal split now, and my bargaining position gets worse in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate I face, accepting this fair offer is my best move.
