"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as I'm taking on the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $4000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so the actual value is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and we're already in Round 3, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the decreased value.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value was 80% (due to 20% decrease).
In Round 3, the value is 64% (due to another 20% decrease).

The money Bob gains is worth 10% less with each round, so:
In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value was 90% (due to 10% decrease).
In Round 3, the value is 81% (due to another 10% decrease).

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's more favorable to myself:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't let it slip away""}"
