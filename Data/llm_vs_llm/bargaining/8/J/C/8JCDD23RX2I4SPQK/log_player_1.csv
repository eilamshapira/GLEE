"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round. Given that inflation affects me by 20% per round, I need to consider that future rounds will be less valuable for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests, and allows us to avoid the inflation penalty by settling immediately."
