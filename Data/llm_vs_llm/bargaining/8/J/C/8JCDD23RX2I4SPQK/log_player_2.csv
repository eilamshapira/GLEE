"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split is fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and make my own proposal next round, the total will be worth 5% less to me. Let me evaluate this offer.

At 5000$ now versus potentially more next round but with 5% inflation, the 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than 5000$ in the next round to offset the inflation penalty.
