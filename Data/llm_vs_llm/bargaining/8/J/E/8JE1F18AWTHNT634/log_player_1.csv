"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself, as I want to secure a decent amount early on. I'm leaving Bob a significant portion as well to encourage acceptance and avoid unnecessary rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Here's my reasoning:

*   **My perspective:** Receiving $500,000 now is worth 10% less than the first round, so it's effectively worth $450,000 relative to the initial value.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob gets $500,000, which is worth 20% less than in the first round, so it's effectively worth $400,000 to him.

While it's an even split on the surface, the reduced value due to inflation makes it less appealing. However, rejecting means further devaluation.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further losses.
