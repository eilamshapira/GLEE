"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the revised rules regarding inflation. Let's analyze Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gets $400,000, and Bob gets $600,000.

Since the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, that $600,000 is effectively worth $600,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $540,000 to him in terms of purchasing power *relative to the first round*. My share is still worth the same as the first round.
Given that the first offer I made gave me $600,000, accepting $400,000 now would be a significant drop.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. Remembering that I experience no inflation, and factoring in Bob's 10% inflation from the previous round, I need to offer him slightly more to compensate, but still try to get a decent amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4.

Bob's offer: Alice gets $450,000, and Bob gets $550,000.

Inflation is now at 27.1% for Bob. Thus, his $550,000 is worth $550,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $550,000 * 0.729 = $400,950 in first-round dollars. I'm still at the original value.

Given that my previous offer was $550,000, and now he's offering me $450,000...

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is really hitting Bob hard now. I need to take that into account, but I also need to get this done before *I* start experiencing inflation. Let's try to find a balance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6.

Bob's offer: Alice gets $475,000, and Bob gets $525,000.

Inflation is now at 40.95% for Bob. Thus, his $525,000 is worth $525,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $525,000 * 0.5905 = $310,012.50 in first-round dollars. I'm still at the original value. He must really want a bigger piece, or he's playing irrationally. This is still far lower than what I asked for in my first offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob's inflation is eating away at his potential gain. I'll try a slightly more aggressive offer, hoping he takes it this time.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
