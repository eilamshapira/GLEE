"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split where we both receive $500,000. This is the most equitable division and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly rather than continue negotiating and losing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45-55 split where I receive $450,000 and Alice receives $550,000. This is a reasonable compromise that gives Alice the larger share while still being fair to both of us. The inflation penalty is increasing with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continue negotiating and losing more value."
