"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I'll get $45, but due to 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $42.75 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer in the next round, I'll face another 5% inflation, making any amount worth even less
- Bob's position is getting stronger as inflation affects only my side
- Making another round might lead to even worse offers for me

Given these factors, while this isn't ideal, it's probably better to accept now than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds due to inflation.
