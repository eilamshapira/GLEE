"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 with 5% inflation, so effectively $427,500
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But I'll face another 5% inflation (total 10% less value)
   - Bob might reject again, leading to even more losses

Given that:
- The current offer gives me a decent portion
- Further delays will definitely reduce my gains due to inflation
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer in the next round
- Bob is not affected by inflation, so he has less pressure to agree
