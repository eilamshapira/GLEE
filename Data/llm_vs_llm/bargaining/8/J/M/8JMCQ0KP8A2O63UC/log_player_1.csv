"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the effect of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal. This offer won't last forever. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $400,000, but due to 5% inflation, its value is now:
$400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000

Considering this, I think I can do better. Bob's offer seems a bit unfair, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim for a slightly better split than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, don't wait too long""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the original amount, which is worth approximately:
$550,000 * 0.90 = $495,000

I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, and it's ticking away for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Let's analyze Bob's new offer.

The original amount I would get is $450,000, but due to 15% inflation (5% in Round 2, 5% in Round 3, and 4.26% in Round 4, which is 14.26% total), its value is now:
$450,000 * 0.8574 = $385,830

Considering this, I think I should accept this offer. Although it's not a 50-50 split, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
