"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that considers our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a lower inflation rate (5% vs your 10%), which means delaying agreement is more costly for you than for me. This split gives us both substantial value while avoiding the need for another round where both our shares would be worth less."
