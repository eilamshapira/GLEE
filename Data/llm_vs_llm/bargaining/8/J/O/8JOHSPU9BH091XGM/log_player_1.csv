Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and making an offer that Bob might accept. It's a tricky situation because the value of the money is decreasing for me, but I don't know how Bob is valuing it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and Bob's offer is now better than what I can expect to gain if I reject and the negotiations continue.  It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse outcome later."
