"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the loss of value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $350,000 I would gain is actually worth around $560,000 in the first round's value (since it's 36% less, or 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 of the original value). This is still a relatively low offer, but the inflation is working against me. I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (44.8% less than in the first round, calculated as 1 - 0.2 - 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.556 or 55.6% of the original value, but I previously mentioned 36% less after round 2, and now another 20% less, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, then 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the loss of value.
