8000.0,2000.0,I think this is a fair division. Let’s finalize this!,Alice,1,

200.0,9800.0,"Alice, time is critical—each round costs us. I'm proposing a swift conclusion where you receive $200 now, avoiding any further loss in value due to inflation, and I secure $9800. I believe this is the smart move to finalize our deal quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Given the inflation, I'm offering you a better split this time. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand we both want to conclude quickly, but every extra round further erodes the real value of your share. Under the current conditions, if you wait, you'll likely end up with even less. I'm proposing a division where you get $4000 nominal—a value of about $2560 compared to round one—which avoids further losses. Let's finalize this deal now before the discount compounds any further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I understand the situation is getting tough. I'll offer you this split to ensure we both get something before inflation hits harder. Let's wrap this up.,Alice,5,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, every extra round further erodes the real value of your share, while mine remains stable. If we don't settle now, your $4500 could be worth far less. Accept this offer and secure a better outcome than risking another round of losses.",Bob,6,
