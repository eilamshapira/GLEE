Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is critical—each round costs us. I'm proposing a swift conclusion where you receive $200 now, avoiding any further loss in value due to inflation, and I secure $9800. I believe this is the smart move to finalize our deal quickly.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to conclude quickly, but every extra round further erodes the real value of your share. Under the current conditions, if you wait, you'll likely end up with even less. I'm proposing a division where you get $4000 nominal—a value of about $2560 compared to round one—which avoids further losses. Let's finalize this deal now before the discount compounds any further.

# Bob gain: 6000
