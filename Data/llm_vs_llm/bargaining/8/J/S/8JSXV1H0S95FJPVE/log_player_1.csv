"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in this round my proposal is based on the value depreciation we both face. If you reject, you'll propose next round but the pie will be slightly smaller for you due to continued depreciation. To keep things fair and avoid further loss, I offer you 791667 dollars while I take 208333 dollars. I believe this is a balanced offer considering our differing discount ratesâ€”please accept and let's settle the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 791667 
# Bob gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
