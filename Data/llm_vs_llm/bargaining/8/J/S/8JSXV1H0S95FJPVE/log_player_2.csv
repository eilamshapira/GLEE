Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 208333, ""alice_gain"": 791667, ""message"": ""Alice, in this round my proposal is based on the value depreciation we both face. If you reject, you'll propose next round but the pie will be slightly smaller for you due to continued depreciation. To keep things fair and avoid further loss, I offer you 791,667 dollars while I take 208,333 dollars. I believe this is a balanced offer considering our differing discount ratesâ€”please accept and let's settle the deal now.""}"
