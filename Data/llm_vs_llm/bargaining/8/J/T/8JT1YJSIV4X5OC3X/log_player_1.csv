"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this first round, I'll make a proposal considering the inflation conditions.

Given that with each passing round, the money doesn't lose value for me, but Bob faces 20% inflation, I can propose a fair division that accounts for this asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in our favor. This is fair considering that if Bob rejects and we go to another round, the $100 will be worth less to him due to the 20% inflation he faces. By accepting now, he gets $45 at full value rather than making a counter-offer when the money is worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
