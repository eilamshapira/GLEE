"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer in this division game with Bob. Given the inflation scenarios, I should take that into account in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 834000, ""bob_gain"": 166000}

I propose this division because it reflects our different inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob each round, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. My proposal gives Bob a meaningful portion while acknowledging that I'm not affected by inflation across rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for the progressive inflation for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering Bob a more generous amount than my first proposal. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, if he rejects this offer, his next counteroffer would be worth even less to him. This division gives him a substantial portion while still being advantageous for me given our different inflation positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
