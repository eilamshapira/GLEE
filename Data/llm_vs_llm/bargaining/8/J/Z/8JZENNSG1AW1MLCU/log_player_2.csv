"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money is worth 5% less
   - $100 * 0.95 = $95 total value
   - Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the decreased value might offset the gain
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

The 60-40 split isn't ideal, but considering:
- The immediate certainty
- The risk of value loss from inflation
- The possibility of further negotiations leading to worse outcomes
- It's not a terrible initial offer

I'll accept this offer.
