"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $10,000. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round and Bob faces no inflation, it's in my interest to reach a fair agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split, giving us each $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without any loss of value from inflation."
