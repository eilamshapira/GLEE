"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering that waiting will cost me 10% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to offer Bob a substantial portion while still maintaining a slight advantage as the first mover. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob significant value while protecting my interests against inflation if he chooses to reject and move to the next round."
