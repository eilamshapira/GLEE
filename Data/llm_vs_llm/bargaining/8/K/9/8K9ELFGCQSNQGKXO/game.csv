60.0,40.0,Let's split the money. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. It's important to settle this quickly due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, to avoid further value loss from inflation on my end, I propose a swift resolution: I receive $45 and you receive $55. This fair split ensures both of us get as much value as possible in today's dollars. Let's settle quickly and put inflation behind us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this quickly. I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. Let's avoid further losses from inflation and wrap this up.",Alice,3,

81.0,19.0,"Alice, I understand that waiting hurts us both â€“ and I know the depreciation on your side is even harsher. If we head into another round, you might get close to the whole $100 nominally in round 5, but that would only be worth about $40.96 relative to round 1, whereas this offer gives you $81 nominal in round 4 (worth about $41.47 in round 1 terms). To avoid further losses, I'm offering $81 for you and taking $19 for myself. I believe this small premium over your continuation value makes settling now a win-win for us.",Bob,4,
