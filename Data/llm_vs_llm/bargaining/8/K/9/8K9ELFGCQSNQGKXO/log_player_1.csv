Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further value loss from inflation on my end, I propose a swift resolution: I receive $45 and you receive $55. This fair split ensures both of us get as much value as possible in today's dollars. Let's settle quickly and put inflation behind us.

# Bob gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that waiting hurts us both â€“ and I know the depreciation on your side is even harsher. If we head into another round, you might get close to the whole $100 nominally in round 5, but that would only be worth about $40.96 relative to round 1, whereas this offer gives you $81 nominal in round 4 (worth about $41.47 in round 1 terms). To avoid further losses, I'm offering $81 for you and taking $19 for myself. I believe this small premium over your continuation value makes settling now a win-win for us. 
# Alice gain: 81 
# Bob gain: 19 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob has correctly identified my diminishing returns due to the higher inflation I face. While I could push for more in round 5, the value of the money would be significantly less. Accepting his offer now guarantees a decent amount relative to the initial value, even if it means he gets a better deal."
