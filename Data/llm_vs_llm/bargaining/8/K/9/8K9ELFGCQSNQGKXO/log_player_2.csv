"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. It's important to settle this quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, to avoid further value loss from inflation on my end, I propose a swift resolution: I receive $45 and you receive $55. This fair split ensures both of us get as much value as possible in today's dollars. Let's settle quickly and put inflation behind us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this quickly. I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. Let's avoid further losses from inflation and wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 19, ""alice_gain"": 81, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand that waiting hurts us both â€“ and I know the depreciation on your side is even harsher. If we head into another round, you might get close to the whole $100 nominally in round 5, but that would only be worth about $40.96 relative to round 1, whereas this offer gives you $81 nominal in round 4 (worth about $41.47 in round 1 terms). To avoid further losses, I'm offering $81 for you and taking $19 for myself. I believe this small premium over your continuation value makes settling now a win-win for us.""}"
