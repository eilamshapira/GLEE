"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

The total amount after the first round for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.

I'll make a proposal that takes into account the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's aim for a fair split. This offer gives us both a reasonable share, but we should agree soon to minimize further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal. Let's end this now with a 50/50 split and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
