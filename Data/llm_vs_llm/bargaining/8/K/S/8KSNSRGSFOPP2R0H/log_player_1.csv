"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money evenly - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both equal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500. Since Bob is affected by inflation as rounds progress, this offer gives him a larger portion while still being reasonable for both of us."
