"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My effective gain:** The initial $10,000, but my money is worth 5% less. I would be getting $5000, which is now worth 5000 * (1-0.05) = $4750 in terms of the initial money value.
*   **Bob's effective gain:** Bob's money is worth 20% less, meaning his $5000 is worth 5000 * (1-0.20) = $4000 in terms of initial money value.

Considering the inflation impact on me, this offer seems fair.
