"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on my portion, but I'll get to make the next offer.

Given that we're only in Round 1 and I can make the next offer, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice will likely accept. Since the money loses 20% value for me each round but I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I should propose a fair division that's attractive enough for her to accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is the fairest division possible. This way, we both get an equal share of $5,000, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value of my portion."
