650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob! Given that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), accepting now maximizes our combined value. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges this time pressure while being fair to both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the loss from inflation. It's a win-win situation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than my first proposal. Consider this: if we go to round 4, your $500K would be worth only $320K to you due to your 20% inflation rate. This $400K now is worth more than $500K in the next round. Let's avoid further losses for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to secure more value for myself as the rounds progress. This offer gives me a slight advantage but still provides you with a substantial amount. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our last offers. At this point, your 20% inflation rate means your money is worth less than 50% of its original value, while mine is only down about 19%. This $450K now is worth more to you than $550K in the next round. This is my best offer - further delays significantly hurt us both, but especially you.",Alice,5,
