"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer that considers the diminishing value for both of us, but especially Bob's higher discount rate.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), accepting now maximizes our combined value. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges this time pressure while being fair to both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the loss from inflation. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than my first proposal. Consider this: if we go to round 4, your $500K would be worth only $320K to you due to your 20% inflation rate. This $400K now is worth more than $500K in the next round. Let's avoid further losses for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to secure more value for myself as the rounds progress. This offer gives me a slight advantage but still provides you with a substantial amount. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our last offers. At this point, your 20% inflation rate means your money is worth less than 50% of its original value, while mine is only down about 19%. This $450K now is worth more to you than $550K in the next round. This is my best offer - further delays significantly hurt us both, but especially you.""}"
