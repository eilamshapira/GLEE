"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Given that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), accepting now maximizes our combined value. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges this time pressure while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the loss from inflation. It's a win-win situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than my first proposal. Consider this: if we go to round 4, your $500K would be worth only $320K to you due to your 20% inflation rate. This $400K now is worth more than $500K in the next round. Let's avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to secure more value for myself as the rounds progress. This offer gives me a slight advantage but still provides you with a substantial amount. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our last offers. At this point, your 20% inflation rate means your money is worth less than 50% of its original value, while mine is only down about 19%. This $450K now is worth more to you than $550K in the next round. This is my best offer - further delays significantly hurt us both, but especially you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
