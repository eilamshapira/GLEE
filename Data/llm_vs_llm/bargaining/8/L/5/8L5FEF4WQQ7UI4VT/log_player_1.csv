"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a substantial amount for both parties
2. If Bob rejects, his next round money will be worth 20% less
3. It's reasonable enough that it should be accepted rather than risking further devaluation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that if I reject this offer:
1. I'll get to make the next proposal
2. But any money will be worth another 10% less for me
3. And 20% less for Bob

At current inflation rates:
* $5000 now = $4500 real value for me (after 10% inflation)
* If I reject and propose next round, even if I got $6000, it would be worth $4860 to me (after 20% inflation)
* The difference isn't worth the risk
