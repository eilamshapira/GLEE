"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering that the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. This is a fair offer considering that delay costs me more. If we agree now, we both walk away with good amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the honesty about the inflation. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I also want to make sure I get a fair share. What's your thoughts on a 50/50 split? Is that something you'd consider in the next round? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
