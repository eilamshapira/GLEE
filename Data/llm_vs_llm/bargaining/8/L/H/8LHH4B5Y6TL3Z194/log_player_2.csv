"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. This is a fair offer considering that delay costs me more. If we agree now, we both walk away with good amounts. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice has revealed that she's affected by 20% inflation, it's likely that she's trying to get the best deal early on. Considering I have 12 rounds to negotiate, I don't want to settle for less than half right away.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since Alice is affected by 20% inflation, I'll try to take advantage of that by offering a slightly more even split, but still in my favor. I'll also send a message to try to get more information about her thoughts on the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the honesty about the inflation. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I also want to make sure I get a fair share. What's your thoughts on a 50/50 split? Is that something you'd consider in the next round?""}"
