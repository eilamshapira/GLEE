"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. I believe this is a fair start considering the inflation effect on both of us. Let's maximize our gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With 10% inflation per round, if I reject now:
- Current offer is $40
- Next round my $40 would be worth $36
- I'd need to propose something significantly better to make up for the 10% loss

While $40 isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. If negotiations drag on, we both lose value quickly. Getting $40 now is better than potentially getting less later or nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
