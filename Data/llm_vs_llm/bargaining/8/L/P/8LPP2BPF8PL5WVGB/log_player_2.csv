"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 60 for me, 40 for you. Inflation hits us both hard, but I'm taking the initial hit. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer:

She's proposing:
- 60$ for her
- 40$ for me

Given that:
- Inflation decreases the value by 5% each round for me
- This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
- If we wait for round 2, my share would effectively be worth 5% less
- We have 12 rounds maximum, but could end up with nothing if we can't agree

While a 50-50 split might seem most fair, her 60-40 proposal isn't unreasonable for a first offer. If I reject and counter-offer, we'll already be facing 5% inflation on my end, which reduces the effective value of any money I receive.
