"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'd like to settle this quickly to avoid any inflation issues. Here's my proposal: I'll take $4500 and you'll receive $5500. This way, we both secure a good share of the $10000 now without any delays. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $5500, which is more than half of the total amount
2. It's a fair offer right in the first round
3. If I reject, there's a risk of:
   - negotiations dragging on
   - potentially getting a worse deal later

This is actually a good offer because:
- I get the majority share (55%)
- There's no inflation loss for me
- It resolves the negotiation immediately
