Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since the money is losing value for you with each round, it might be wise to accept a slightly lower amount now rather than risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
