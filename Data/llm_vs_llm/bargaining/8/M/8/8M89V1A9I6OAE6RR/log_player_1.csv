Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since I'm facing inflation at 5% per round, accepting now secures our shares before further losses hit me. I believe this is a fair offer for both of usâ€”let's avoid additional delay and lock it in. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
