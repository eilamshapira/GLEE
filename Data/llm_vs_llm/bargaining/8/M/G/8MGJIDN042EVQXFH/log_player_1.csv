"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. Since this is the first round, I'll try to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept, but also ensure I get a good portion.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now, it's Round 2, and the money I receive is worth 5% less. Bob is offering me $4500. Let's consider this:

*   **Original Value:** $4500
*   **Inflation Adjusted Value:** $4500 * (1 - 0.05) = $4275 (relative to the initial $10,000).

I need to decide if receiving $4275 (in relative value to the initial round) is better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds. While it's tempting to reject and try to get more later, the inflation is a significant factor. $4275 is not a great outcome, but it's better than risking an even lower value due to potentially many more rounds of inflation if Bob rejects my next offer as well. Bob may also be playing a strategy where he will keep proposing 5500 for himself and 4500 for me.

""decision"": ""accept""
}
