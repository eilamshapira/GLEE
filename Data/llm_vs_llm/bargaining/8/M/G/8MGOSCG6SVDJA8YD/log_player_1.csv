"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that a slightly favorable offer to myself is reasonable to start with, as I'm making the first offer. I hope Bob finds it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My original gain would have been worth $60. Now, Bob is offering me $47. Let's calculate the actual value after the 5% inflation:

$60 * 0.95 = $57

So, the original offer was worth $57 in today's money.

Now, is $47 acceptable? I think it's a bit low, but rejecting it means further inflation.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to factor in the inflation from the previous rounds. The money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original $100. I also need to consider what Bob might accept, and the potential for further inflation if we go to another round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering slightly less than my original offer, accounting for inflation and trying to find a balance that Bob might accept. I hope Bob accepts this time."
