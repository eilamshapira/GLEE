"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money value decreases by 20% each round, in the next round:
- My $5000+ would still be worth the same to me
- Her share would only be worth 80% of its current value to her

This means I have negotiating leverage. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, she would be more inclined to accept a less equal split since any further delay reduces the value for her.

I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and proposing something like 6000/4000 in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 20% of its value in this round, I should propose a split that takes this into account. If I offer her $4000 now, it's worth the same to her as $5000 would have been in round 1. This makes my offer fair from her perspective while being better for me.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose we split it $6000 for me and $4000 for you, Alice. This accounts for the 20% value decrease you're experiencing, making it a fair deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a good offer that I should accept. Here's why:

1. Alice is offering me $6800, which is better than my previous proposal of $6000
2. Due to the 36% inflation on her side, the $3200 she's asking for is actually worth even less to her (equivalent to about $2048 in round 1 value for her)
3. If I reject, in the next round her money would be worth even less (52% less than round 1), but I risk her making a worse offer out of spite
4. The money maintains its full value for me, so $6800 is a very good deal
