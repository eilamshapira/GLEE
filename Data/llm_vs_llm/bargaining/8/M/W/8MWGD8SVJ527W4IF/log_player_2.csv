"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While not perfectly equal, it's relatively close to a 50-50 split. 

If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make my own proposal in the next round, but I need to factor in the 20% inflation penalty. My $45 now would be worth more than what I might get in future rounds due to inflation.

Given the inflation effect, accepting $45 now seems better than risking getting less value in future rounds.
