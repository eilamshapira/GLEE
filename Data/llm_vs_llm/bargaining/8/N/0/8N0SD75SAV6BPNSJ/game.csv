,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I propose a more balanced 55-45 split. This is fairer than your initial offer.,Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains, this deal becomes more favorable for you if we close it now rather than later. I'm offering you $420000 now, which is worth more than the same amount would be in future rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Still willing to compromise, but need a better deal",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"With inflation at 18.55% and rising, your $400000 now is worth more than $560000 would be after several more rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently - this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Inflation hurts, but I still want a fair share",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Let's be practical - with 26.49% inflation, your $540K from last round was worth only $397K to you. This $350K now is better than a larger number that will be worth much less after more rounds of inflation. Time to conclude this reasonably.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Getting desperate, but still want a somewhat fair deal",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"With 33.66% inflation currently affecting you, your last offer of $520K was only worth $345K to you - less than what I was offered. This $300K now is better than waiting for the even higher inflation in the final rounds. Let's end this now before your position weakens further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Last chance for a somewhat even split, before I'm forced to accept a bad deal",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"This is the final round - we must reach an agreement or we both get nothing. With over 40% inflation affecting you, this $200K now is better than getting nothing. You indicated last round you'd accept a worse deal to avoid zero. This is your last chance to secure any value.",Bob,12,
