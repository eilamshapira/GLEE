"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. This is not an equal split
3. Since it's only round 1 of 12, I have many opportunities to make counter-offers
4. There's no inflation effect on my side, so waiting won't hurt me
5. I can likely negotiate a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice tried to get more in the first round:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55-45 split. This is fairer than your initial offer.""}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial 60-40 split, while still giving me a slight advantage. I'm being reasonable but also showing that I won't accept an unfair deal. Since there's no inflation effect on my side, I can afford to negotiate, but I'm also showing willingness to reach a fair agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering me $420,000 (42%) while keeping $580,000 (58%)
2. This is only a small improvement from her first offer of 40-60
3. Due to inflation, her $580,000 is now worth about $523,450 to her (after 9.75% reduction)
4. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $420,000 maintains its full value
5. We still have 9 rounds left, and each round makes her position weaker due to inflation
6. She's likely to become more willing to accept a better deal for me as inflation increases

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that inflation is only affecting Alice and we have many rounds left, I can still negotiate for a better split. The inflation pressure will work in my favor in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing inflation pressure and has already shown some movement toward compromise, I'll make a strong but reasonable offer:

{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains, this deal becomes more favorable for you if we close it now rather than later. I'm offering you $420,000 now, which is worth more than the same amount would be in future rounds.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I'm offering Alice the same amount she offered me ($420,000), which makes it psychologically harder to reject
2. I emphasize the inflation factor to create urgency
3. The split is still within a reasonable range (58-42)
4. If she rejects, inflation will continue to weaken her position in future rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's offering me $440,000 (44%) while keeping $560,000 (56%)
2. Due to inflation, her $560,000 is now worth only about $456,120 to her (after 18.55% reduction)
3. My $440,000 still maintains full value
4. The inflation is increasing significantly (from 9.75% to 18.55%)
5. We still have 7 rounds left, and inflation will continue to increase
6. She's gradually improving her offers ($400K → $420K → $440K), showing she's feeling the pressure

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The increasing inflation rate and Alice's pattern of gradually improving offers suggests I should continue negotiating. Her position is weakening faster than before (inflation nearly doubled), and she's already shown willingness to improve her offers. I can likely get a better deal in the next rounds as the inflation pressure continues to mount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the rapidly increasing inflation and Alice's demonstrated pattern of compromise, I'll make a firm but calculated offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""With inflation at 18.55% and rising, your $400,000 now is worth more than $560,000 would be after several more rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently - this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The 60-40 split reflects the reality of Alice's weakening position due to inflation
2. I'm showing I understand the time pressure she's under while maintaining a firm stance
3. Her last offer showed she's willing to move towards compromise
4. The math works in my favor - if she waits longer, inflation will continue to eat into her share more aggressively
5. If she rejects, her position will continue to weaken as inflation increases even further in subsequent rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts, but I still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's offering me $460,000 (46%) while keeping $540,000 (54%)
2. Due to inflation, her $540,000 is now worth only about $397,000 to her (after 26.49% reduction)
3. My $460,000 maintains full value
4. Inflation has increased dramatically (from 18.55% to 26.49%)
5. Her real value is now less than what she's offering me
6. She's continuing her pattern of gradual increases ($400K → $420K → $440K → $460K)

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The math now strongly favors continuing to negotiate:
1. Alice's real value after inflation ($397K) is now less than my offered $460K
2. The inflation rate is accelerating significantly
3. We still have 5 rounds left
4. Her consistent pattern of improving offers suggests she'll likely go higher
5. The inflation pressure on her is becoming severe

I'll reject and make a stronger offer in the next round, as time and inflation are clearly on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the severe inflation impact and that Alice's real value is now less than mine, I'll make a strong offer:

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - with 26.49% inflation, your $540K from last round was worth only $397K to you. This $350K now is better than a larger number that will be worth much less after more rounds of inflation. Time to conclude this reasonably.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The stark reality of inflation makes this a reasonable offer:
   - Her previous $540K was worth $397K to her
   - At current inflation, this $350K is still worth about $257K to her
2. The math clearly shows that delaying further will only hurt her more
3. We still have 4 rounds where inflation could get even worse for her
4. I'm being direct about the mathematics of the situation
5. This offer reflects the strong negotiating position I have due to being protected from inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a somewhat fair deal 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's offering me $480,000 while keeping $520,000
2. With 33.66% inflation, her $520,000 is actually worth only about $345,000 to her
3. My $480,000 maintains full value
4. She's admitted she's ""getting desperate""
5. The inflation rate continues to climb significantly (from 26.49% to 33.66%)
6. She's still following her pattern of $20K increases in offers

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject because:
1. Her real value ($345K) is now significantly less than what she's offering me ($480K)
2. Her message indicates she's feeling pressure to make a deal
3. The inflation rate is accelerating rapidly
4. We still have 3 rounds left
5. Her position will continue to weaken substantially with each passing round
6. Given her ""desperate"" message and the severe inflation impact, she's likely to accept a more favorable offer to me in the next round"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given Alice's expressed desperation and the severe inflation impact, I'll make a decisive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""With 33.66% inflation currently affecting you, your last offer of $520K was only worth $345K to you - less than what I was offered. This $300K now is better than waiting for the even higher inflation in the final rounds. Let's end this now before your position weakens further.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. The math clearly favors taking a deal now:
   - Her last $520K was worth only $345K to her
   - At current inflation, $300K now is better than risking worse inflation
2. We only have 2 rounds left after this
3. The inflation rate is accelerating dramatically with each round
4. Her ""desperate"" message in the last round signals she's ready to accept a less favorable deal
5. If she rejects, she risks getting an even worse offer in the final rounds
6. I'm being direct about the mathematical reality of her situation while offering a clean, round number"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a somewhat even split, before I'm forced to accept a bad deal 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's offering a 50-50 split ($500K each)
2. With 40.13% inflation, her $500,000 is actually worth only about $299,350 to her
3. My $500,000 maintains full value
4. Her message indicates she expects to accept a worse deal in the final round
5. The inflation has increased dramatically to 40.13%
6. Only one round remains after this

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject because:
1. Despite appearing equal, the split heavily favors me due to inflation
2. Her message clearly signals she'll accept an even worse deal in the final round
3. With only one round left and inflation over 40%, her negotiating position is extremely weak
4. She's essentially admitted she'll have to accept a bad deal in the final round
5. The acceleration of inflation suggests the final round will have even higher inflation
6. Given her message and the extreme inflation, I can likely secure an even better deal in the final round"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given this is the final round and Alice has indicated she'll accept a bad deal to avoid getting nothing, I'll make a very strong offer:

{""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""This is the final round - we must reach an agreement or we both get nothing. With over 40% inflation affecting you, this $200K now is better than getting nothing. You indicated last round you'd accept a worse deal to avoid zero. This is your last chance to secure any value.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. We're at the final round - if no agreement is reached, we both get zero
2. Alice explicitly stated last round she would accept a bad deal to avoid nothing
3. With inflation over 40%, her $200K is still worth about $120K to her, which is better than zero
4. Her negotiating position is at its absolute weakest:
   - Highest inflation rate
   - Final round
   - Already indicated willingness to accept a bad deal
5. She has no more rounds to counter-offer
6. The alternative is both of us getting nothing, which she clearly wants to avoid based on her last message"
