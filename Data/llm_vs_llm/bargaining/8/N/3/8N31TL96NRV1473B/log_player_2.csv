Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56

Since the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round, her actual gain is equivalent to 56 * (1 - 0.3439) = approximately 36.73. Therefore, it's a reasonable deal to accept, as it's close to an equal split considering the inflation effect on Alice."
