"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is 0.95 * $450,000 = $427,500.

Since this is the first offer I'm considering, I'll think about whether this is a good deal or not.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 5% less than in the previous round, which was already 5% less than the original. So, the total decrease in value for me is 5% + 5% = 10% (compounded: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025).

For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, which was already 10% less than the original. So, the total decrease in value for Bob is 10% + 10% = 20% (compounded: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

With these values in mind, here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is biting, let's be realistic 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 14.26% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is 0.8574 * $400,000 = $342,960.

On the other hand, if I reject this offer, I'll have to make another offer in the next round, and the inflation will bite even harder. The money I could potentially get will be worth even less.

Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's time to be realistic, as Bob's message suggests.
