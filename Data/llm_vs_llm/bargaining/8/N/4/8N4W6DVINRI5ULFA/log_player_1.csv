"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I know inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% each round for me, it's important that I secure a reasonable amount now rather than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. This is a fair division, and due to the inflation affecting me more severely (20% per round) than Bob (10% per round), it's in my best interest to accept now rather than continue negotiating. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will diminish further for me, making this current fair split the rational choice."
