"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000}

Since we both face inflation but yours is higher (20% vs my 10%), I'm offering you a larger portion now. This way we can avoid multiple rounds where we'd both lose value. With this split, you get a substantial amount immediately rather than waiting and losing more through inflation."
