"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $4000 while she gets $6000 out of the $10,000.

If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 becomes effectively worth $8,000 to me). For Alice, it will be worth 10% less (so $9,000 to her).

If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and then in the third round, the money would be worth even less to both of us.

Given the higher depreciation rate for me (20% vs Alice's 10%), there's pressure on me to accept sooner rather than later. $4000 now is better than potentially less in future rounds if we keep rejecting each other's offers.
