"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. Hopefully, this is agreeable and we can both walk away with a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. The split (55/45) is relatively fair, though slightly in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, my next proposal would be subject to 10% inflation, meaning the total value would be worth less
4. I could propose a better split next round, but Alice might reject it
5. We only have 12 rounds total, and risking multiple rounds could lead to both of us getting nothing

While I could try to negotiate for a 50/50 split, the current offer is reasonable enough, and the risk of value loss due to inflation makes accepting now a prudent choice.
