"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $500,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, the 20% inflation penalty means I'd need to get significantly more than $500,000 to come out ahead
4. For example, to match the current $500,000 value, I'd need $625,000 in the next round just to break even
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a higher offer

This seems like a fair first offer, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. I should take it.
