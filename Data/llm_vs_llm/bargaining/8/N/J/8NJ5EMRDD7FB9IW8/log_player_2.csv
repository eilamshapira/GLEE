"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $43 I would gain is actually worth $43 * 0.64 = $27.52 in the original value. 

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer again, the money is now worth even less to me due to inflation. The total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64.

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount, but also considering that Alice's value doesn't decrease.
