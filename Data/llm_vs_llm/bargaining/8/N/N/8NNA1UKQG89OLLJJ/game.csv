3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob – to avoid the loss of value in later rounds, I propose we settle now. Considering that with every round my share loses 10% and yours only 5%, the unique subgame‐perfect equilibrium (à la Rubinstein) suggests that I, as the first proposer, should keep about 34.5% while you get about 65.5% of the $10000. Therefore, I propose I receive $3448 and you receive $6552. Let’s agree on this division immediately to maximize our winnings.",Alice,1,
