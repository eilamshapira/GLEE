"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3448, ""bob_gain"": 6552, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – to avoid the loss of value in later rounds, I propose we settle now. Considering that with every round my share loses 10% and yours only 5%, the unique subgame‐perfect equilibrium (à la Rubinstein) suggests that I, as the first proposer, should keep about 34.5% while you get about 65.5% of the $10,000. Therefore, I propose I receive $3,448 and you receive $6,552. Let’s agree on this division immediately to maximize our winnings.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while your logic is sound, I believe a more equitable split is in order.  Let's split the difference a bit more - 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
