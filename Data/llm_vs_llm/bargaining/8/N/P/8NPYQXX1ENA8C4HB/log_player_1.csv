"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates we face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me because my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than yours (5%). This means waiting hurts me more than you. This is a fair split considering our different situations.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your situation with the higher inflation rate, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair at this point. We both lose value with each round, but starting equal gives us a balanced base to negotiate from. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I had to reject your 50-50 offer because our inflation rates are very different. Each round costs me 20% value while only costing you 5%. After just 5 rounds, my money would be worth half its original value, while yours would still be worth 77%. I've increased my request to account for this significant disadvantage. This is mathematically fair considering our different inflation rates.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see your point about the different inflation rates affecting us unequally. I'm willing to adjust my offer to 4800 for me and 5200 for you. This way, I'm conceding a bit more to account for your higher rate of value loss, but it's still close to an even split. Let's settle on this and end the game before our values decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
