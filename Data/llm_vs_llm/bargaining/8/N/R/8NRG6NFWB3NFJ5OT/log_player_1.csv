Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep it even at $5000 each. It's fair and considering inflation, it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
