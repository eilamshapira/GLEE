520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $520000 and you get $480000. Given that each round decreases the value—especially for you at 10%—this split aims to maximize our immediate gains and avoid further loss. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, and I look forward to your response.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the higher depreciation rate I'm facing, I think a slightly higher share for me is reasonable. This offer aims to balance our interests and encourage a swift agreement to minimize losses for both of us.",Bob,2,

380000.0,620000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose that I receive $380000 and you receive $620000 by nominal dollars. With the current inflation, my share effectively becomes about $342000 (0.90×380000) and yours about $496000 (0.80×620000), which is roughly in line with your previous effective offer. I believe that locking in an agreement now will help us both avoid further erosion of value in later rounds. I look forward to your decision.",Alice,3,
