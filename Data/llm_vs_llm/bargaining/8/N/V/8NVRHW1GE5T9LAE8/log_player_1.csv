Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $520,000 and you get $480,000. Given that each round decreases the value—especially for you at 10%—this split aims to maximize our immediate gains and avoid further loss. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, and I look forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the higher depreciation rate I'm facing, I think a slightly higher share for me is reasonable. This offer aims to balance our interests and encourage a swift agreement to minimize losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 380000, ""bob_gain"": 620000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose that I receive $380,000 and you receive $620,000 by nominal dollars. With the current inflation, my share effectively becomes about $342,000 (0.90×380,000) and yours about $496,000 (0.80×620,000), which is roughly in line with your previous effective offer. I believe that locking in an agreement now will help us both avoid further erosion of value in later rounds. I look forward to your decision.""}"
