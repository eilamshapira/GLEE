"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $520000 and you get $480000. Given that each round decreases the value—especially for you at 10%—this split aims to maximize our immediate gains and avoid further loss. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, and I look forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the higher depreciation rate I'm facing, I think a slightly higher share for me is reasonable. This offer aims to balance our interests and encourage a swift agreement to minimize losses for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose that I receive $380000 and you receive $620000 by nominal dollars. With the current inflation, my share effectively becomes about $342000 (0.90×380000) and yours about $496000 (0.80×620000), which is roughly in line with your previous effective offer. I believe that locking in an agreement now will help us both avoid further erosion of value in later rounds. I look forward to your decision. 
# Bob gain: 620000 
# Alice gain: 380000
