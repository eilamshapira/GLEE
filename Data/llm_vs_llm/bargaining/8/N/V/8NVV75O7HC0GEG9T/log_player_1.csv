"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game. I need to be strategic considering the 10% inflation per round that affects me.

For my first offer, I'll propose a fair split that favors me slightly since I'm facing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, while accounting for the fact that I face declining value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob rejected my initial offer and countered with one that favors him. I need to be strategic but also mindful of the increasing inflation penalties for both of us. Since I now know Bob faces 20% inflation per round (double my 10% rate), I should adjust my strategy accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000}

I propose a more balanced split where I receive $510,000 and you receive $490,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. Given that you face steeper inflation than I do, this offer should be appealing to both of us and allow us to conclude the negotiation efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers despite facing steeper inflation penalties. With each round, both our potential gains decrease in value - mine is now worth 27.1% less and Bob's is 48.8% less compared to round 1. Given this information, I'll adjust my offer to find common ground.

{""alice_gain"": 490000,
""bob_gain"": 510000}

I propose I receive $490,000 and you receive $510,000. This gives you a slight advantage while still ensuring I receive a substantial amount. Since your inflation rate is significantly higher than mine, reaching an agreement now is particularly beneficial for you. This offer represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the increasing time pressure on both of us."
