"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider both the offer and the effect of inflation on my money.

Alice is offering me 40 out of 100 dollars, keeping 60 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. 

If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be at most 80% of the current 100 dollars (due to the 20% inflation penalty). Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, the maximum value I could potentially receive would be diminished by inflation.

Since 40 dollars now is likely better than a potentially larger portion of an inflation-reduced amount, I'll accept the current offer.
