"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly: I'll take 600k and you take 400k. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I have an advantage by waiting. I can propose a better split in the next round when Alice's position is weaker.

Also, a 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't particularly fair given we started with equal positions.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money devalues at 10% and mine at 5%, I have a stronger position now. For Alice, the money is worth only 90% of its original value, while for me it's 95%.

Let me propose a more favorable split, considering our relative positions:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given the 10% devaluation on your side versus 5% on mine, this split is actually more favorable to you than it appears. If you reject, your next offer will be worth even less to you.""}"
