"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer is a straightforward 50-50 split, I can actually negotiate for a better deal given the asymmetric inflation penalty. Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round while I face 0%, delaying is more costly for her than for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the inflation asymmetry while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a 55-45 split that favors me slightly. This is fair because if we delay, the money is worth 10% less to you each round, which puts you at a disadvantage in negotiations. This offer gives you a substantial amount now before any depreciation occurs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now matched the offer I made in round 2, offering me 550,000 and herself 450,000. Since she's now willing to accept the terms I proposed earlier, and further negotiation would only decrease the value of her portion due to the 10% per round inflation she faces, I should accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
