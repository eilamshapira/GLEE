Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,""bob_gain"": 40,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair divide. I take 60$, you take 40$. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5%), this is a fair offer that gives you $45 now rather than less value in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
