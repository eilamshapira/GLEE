"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair divide. I take 60$, you take 40$. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 20% less
   - I get to make the next proposal

Given that Alice's discount rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. If I reject and propose in the next round, she'll be more likely to accept a better offer for me since her money will be worth significantly less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough for her to accept given the time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Given that your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5%), this is a fair offer that gives you $45 now rather than less value in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}"
