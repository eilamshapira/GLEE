"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round while I face no inflation, we should try to reach an agreement quickly, but I'll propose a division that's favorable to me while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this split because it's fair to recognize that Bob has an incentive to agree quickly due to his 5% inflation penalty per round. If we move to the next round, his purchasing power decreases, so this offer gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for the inflation Bob is facing while still maintaining a good position for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this compromise because Bob is facing 5% inflation per round, meaning his current 5000 will be worth even less if we continue negotiating. This offer gives him more than my initial offer while still securing a good outcome for me. If we don't reach an agreement now, the time pressure affects Bob more than me due to inflation, so this is a reasonable middle ground."
