"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face in each round.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me.

If I reject and we go to round 2, I'd be dividing $10,000 that's effectively worth only $9,500 to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, Alice might reject, and we'd go to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me.

Given the inflation penalty I face, I should carefully consider accepting a reasonable first offer rather than risking further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while trying to improve my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the money. Since I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and a 50-50 split is the fairest possible division that should be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total. This is better than her initial offer of $4,000.

However, due to inflation, the $4,500 is worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round. So effectively, it's worth about $4,061 in round 1 terms.

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where I'll face even more inflation (around 14.26% from the first round), making any potential gain worth even less to me.

Given that Alice has increased her offer, and considering the mounting inflation penalty I face, accepting this improved offer seems reasonable.
