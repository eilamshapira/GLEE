"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair split would be beneficial for both of us, considering the inflation rates. Let's settle for this amount to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $10,000, and due to inflation, the value for me decreased by 5%, making it $9,500. Bob's offer gives me $5,000, which is approximately 52.6% of the decreased value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and accepting it might be better than risking further losses due to inflation.
