"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor. Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less with each round), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me leverage in negotiation.

I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll now make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a fair split that gives me a bit more than half, which improves significantly on Alice's initial offer while still providing Alice with a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer, now proposing a 50-50 split. I also received important information: Alice is experiencing 36% inflation on her gains since the first round, while I experience no inflation.

This explains why Alice is now offering a more favorable split - her $50 is actually worth less to her now (equivalent to about $32 in round 1 value for her). If I reject and we continue to another round, her inflation will likely increase further, potentially making her willing to offer me even more.

However, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer better terms in future rounds. She might become more aggressive in her demands despite the inflation she faces.
