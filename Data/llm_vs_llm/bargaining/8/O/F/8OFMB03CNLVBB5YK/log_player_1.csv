"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds. Since I want to encourage acceptance while protecting my interests, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's fair enough to have a good chance of being accepted, while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob declines, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

For me, due to inflation, if I accept this offer:
$500,000 is now worth only $400,000 (80% of original value)

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
- Bob might reject again, leading to further depreciation
- We have limited rounds, and getting nothing is a real risk

Given that Bob's offer is fairly reasonable (a 50-50 split) and inflation is only affecting my side, accepting now is better than risking further depreciation.
