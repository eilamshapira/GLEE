689655.0,310345.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. This offer gives you the same effective value you’d expect if you waited until the next round (when your money is worth 10% less), while we both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial split. What do you say?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. I'm offering you 450000 and keeping 550000 for myself. This is a good deal for both of us as we can both keep a significant portion of the money.,Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I reject your offer. The current arrangement gives me an effective 427500 (at 5% discount), which is lower than what I can aim for as the proposer in the next round, especially considering your 10% discount rate. I believe waiting will allow a division that better reflects our respective discount factors and the value I bring in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
689655.0,310345.0,"Hi Bob, in light of our discount factors (5% per round for me and 10% per round for you), the subgame perfect equilibrium remains the same. I propose that I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. If you reject, you'll have to wait another round—and with your money losing value faster (10% per round), you'll end up with a lower effective payoff. I believe this split is fair given our respective positions. What do you say?",Alice,3,
