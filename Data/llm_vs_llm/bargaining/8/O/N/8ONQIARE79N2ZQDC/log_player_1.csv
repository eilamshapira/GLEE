"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $689,655 and you receive $310,345. This offer gives you the same effective value you’d expect if you waited until the next round (when your money is worth 10% less), while we both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial split. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. I'm offering you 450000 and keeping 550000 for myself. This is a good deal for both of us as we can both keep a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I reject your offer. The current arrangement gives me an effective 427,500 (at 5% discount), which is lower than what I can aim for as the proposer in the next round, especially considering your 10% discount rate. I believe waiting will allow a division that better reflects our respective discount factors and the value I bring in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in light of our discount factors (5% per round for me and 10% per round for you), the subgame perfect equilibrium remains the same. I propose that I receive $689,655 and you receive $310,345. If you reject, you'll have to wait another round—and with your money losing value faster (10% per round), you'll end up with a lower effective payoff. I believe this split is fair given our respective positions. What do you say?""}"
