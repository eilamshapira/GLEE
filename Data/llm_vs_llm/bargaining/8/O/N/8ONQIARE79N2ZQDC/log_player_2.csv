"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. This offer gives you the same effective value you’d expect if you waited until the next round (when your money is worth 10% less), while we both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. I'm offering you 450,000 and keeping 550,000 for myself. This is a good deal for both of us as we can both keep a significant portion of the money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of our discount factors (5% per round for me and 10% per round for you), the subgame perfect equilibrium remains the same. I propose that I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. If you reject, you'll have to wait another round—and with your money losing value faster (10% per round), you'll end up with a lower effective payoff. I believe this split is fair given our respective positions. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655
