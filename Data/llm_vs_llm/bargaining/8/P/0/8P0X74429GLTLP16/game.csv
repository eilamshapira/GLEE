600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest we split the money 60-40 in my favor. I'm facing 5% inflation each round, which significantly decreases the value for me if we delay. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. Let's avoid dragging this out and both walk away with good value today.",Alice,1,
