"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer, splitting the amount almost equally but giving Bob a slightly larger share to incentivize acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split where I get $480,000 and Bob gets $520,000. This is a fair division that gives Bob a slight advantage to encourage acceptance."
