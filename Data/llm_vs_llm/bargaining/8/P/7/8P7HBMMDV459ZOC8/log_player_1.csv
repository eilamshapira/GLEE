"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that is fair and accounts for the differing inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. Since your inflation rate is higher at 10% compared to my 5%, this division acknowledges that you'll lose value faster if we delay agreement. Let's settle this quickly so we both get a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're now in round 3, and inflation is affecting both of us. I'll make a more balanced offer considering our inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and you get $48. Bob, this is better for you than my previous offer, and inflation is reducing our total value with each round. If we continue to reject offers, we'll both end up with less. Let's come to an agreement that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that we're already at round 5, and inflation is significantly reducing our potential gains. Let me propose a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. Bob, this is a fair compromise that acknowledges we're both losing value the longer we negotiate. At this point, you've lost over 27% to inflation while I've lost over 14%. If we continue this pattern of rejections, we'll both end up with much less. Let's agree to this equal division and conclude the game."
