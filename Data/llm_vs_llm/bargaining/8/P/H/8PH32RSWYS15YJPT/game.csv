377668.66,622331.34,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I’ll take $377668.66 and you’ll get $622331.34. This division reflects our future prospects – if you were to wait until the next round, you’d be in a position to secure roughly $622K out of a $900K pie after further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and forward-looking split. Let’s agree now before more value evaporates!",Alice,1,
