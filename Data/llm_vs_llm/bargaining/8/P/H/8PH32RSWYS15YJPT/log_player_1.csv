"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377668.66, ""bob_gain"": 622331.34, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I’ll take $377,668.66 and you’ll get $622,331.34. This division reflects our future prospects – if you were to wait until the next round, you’d be in a position to secure roughly $622K out of a $900K pie after further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and forward-looking split. Let’s agree now before more value evaporates!""}"
