"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I’ll take $377668.66 and you’ll get $622331.34. This division reflects our future prospects – if you were to wait until the next round, you’d be in a position to secure roughly $622K out of a $900K pie after further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and forward-looking split. Let’s agree now before more value evaporates! 
# Bob gain: 622331.34 
# Alice gain: 377668.66 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
