Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's just split it 50/50. It's the fairest thing to do, and we're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time pressure is getting real. Accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds, especially since the value for Bob is decreasing rapidly."
