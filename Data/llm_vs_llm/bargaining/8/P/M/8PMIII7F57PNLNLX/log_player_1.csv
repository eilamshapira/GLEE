"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair offer to divide the $1,000,000 that recognizes we both need to agree, and that the money loses value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with the same amount. Since the money loses 5% value each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
