"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. The offer gives me 40% of the total
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. 40$ now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. While not exactly equal, 40-60 split is a reasonable offer

I'll accept this offer to secure a decent amount without risking inflation losses.
