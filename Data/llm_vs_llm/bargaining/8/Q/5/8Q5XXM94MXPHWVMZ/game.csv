550000.0,450000.0,I propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover. This is a reasonable offer that avoids the risk of inflation affecting both of us in future rounds.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I think a fair split is a 55/45 split in my favor, since I'm the one making the offer now. I'm open to negotiation, but I don't want to risk further inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Given that you're experiencing higher inflation (20%) than I am (5%), this split is actually quite fair in real value. If we continue to later rounds, both of us will lose more value. Let's conclude this now with a deal that benefits us both.",Alice,3,
