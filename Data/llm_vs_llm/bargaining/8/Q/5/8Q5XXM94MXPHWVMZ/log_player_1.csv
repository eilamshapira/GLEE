Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair split is a 55/45 split in my favor, since I'm the one making the offer now. I'm open to negotiation, but I don't want to risk further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): The value I would receive is 450000 * 0.95 = 427,500 in round 1 value. I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and even with another 5% inflation hit, I might be able to negotiate a better deal. Also, Bob is experiencing higher inflation (20%), which gives me some leverage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
