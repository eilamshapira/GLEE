"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that you're experiencing higher inflation (20%) than I am (5%), this split is actually quite fair in real value. If we continue to later rounds, both of us will lose more value. Let's conclude this now with a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
