Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll soon find yourself in a position where you're forced to give me nearly everything. I’m offering you $200 now—a positive gain rather than the nothing you'd end up with later. I believe this is the most rational resolution for both of us. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we settle now with a slight edge in my favor — 5200 for me and 4800 for you. This adjustment reflects the dynamics we've experienced so far, and any further delay risks diminishing both our returns. Let’s conclude this fairly and efficiently.
