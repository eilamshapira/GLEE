6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it reasonably. I'm offering $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is a fair starting point, considering we both want to gain something and inflation will hurt me more in the long run if we keep negotiating. Let's take this offer.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's be fair.  Since you're at a disadvantage with inflation, I'm offering you $4000, but I need at least $6000 to make this worth my while. Let's end this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I understand you want to make this worthwhile, but I'm already at a disadvantage with inflation. My offer is now $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is a slightly better offer for me than before, and it should be acceptable for you. Let's not risk further devaluation of the money for me. It is still a good deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to move closer to a fair split.  I'm offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for you.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it prevents further risk of devaluation.  Let's make this happen.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, inflation is really starting to hurt me. I need to account for the decreasing value of the money. I'm now offering $7000 for me and $3000 for you. It might seem unbalanced, but the devaluation of the money is affecting me. Please consider this offer seriously. Let's make this work.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is a factor for you, but we need to find a compromise. I'm offering you $4000 again, which is a fair share considering the devaluation. Let's end this now before things get worse.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, I am now offering $7500 for me and $2500 for you. The inflation is taking a huge toll on my potential gains, and this offer reflects the diminishing value I would receive if we continue to delay. This might seem like a large portion for me, but the actual value I receive after inflation is much less than it appears. I implore you to accept this offer; it's the only way we can both secure something before it's too late.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. Inflation is hurting us both now. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  This is the best way to ensure we both get something before it's too late.",Bob,8,
