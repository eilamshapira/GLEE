# Alice's message: Let's split it reasonably. I'm offering $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is a fair starting point, considering we both want to gain something and inflation will hurt me more in the long run if we keep negotiating. Let's take this offer.

This is a slightly better offer for me than before, and it should be acceptable for you. Let's not risk further devaluation of the money for me. It is still a good deal for both of us.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I am now offering $7500 for me and $2500 for you. The inflation is taking a huge toll on my potential gains, and this offer reflects the diminishing value I would receive if we continue to delay. This might seem like a large portion for me, but the actual value I receive after inflation is much less than it appears. I implore you to accept this offer; it's the only way we can both secure something before it's too late.
