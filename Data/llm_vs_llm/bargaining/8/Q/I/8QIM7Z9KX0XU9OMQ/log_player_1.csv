"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation pressure I'm facing. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair approach. This way we both get an equal share and can avoid further rounds of inflation. Let's work together on this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- In round 1, I tried a 60-40 split which was rejected
- Bob is now offering 50-50 ($5000 each)
- Due to inflation, my $5000 is worth 20% less = $4000 effective value
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth even less (40% less than original value)
- Better to accept a fair split now than risk further devaluation
- Bob seems reasonable and collaborative
- This is a decent outcome given the circumstances"
