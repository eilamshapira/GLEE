"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation pressure I'm facing. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives her 60% of the money while offering me only 40%. With inflation affecting me at 10% per round, it might be tempting to accept quickly, but I think we can achieve a more balanced split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair approach. This way we both get an equal share and can avoid further rounds of inflation. Let's work together on this.""}"
