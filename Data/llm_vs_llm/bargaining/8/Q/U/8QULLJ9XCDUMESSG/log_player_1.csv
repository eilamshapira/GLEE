Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split this 50-50. This is the most equitable solution, and we both walk away with significant value. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
