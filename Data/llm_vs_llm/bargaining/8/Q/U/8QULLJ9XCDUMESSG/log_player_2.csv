"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1,000 out of $1,000,000 while she takes $999,000. While inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, I should negotiate for a much more reasonable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a much more fair division while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this 50-50. This is the most equitable solution, and we both walk away with significant value. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
