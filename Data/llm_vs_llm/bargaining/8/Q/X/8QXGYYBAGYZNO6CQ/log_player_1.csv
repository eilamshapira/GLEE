"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division of the $100 that I think is fair considering the inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, it's important that we reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is looking for a larger share, but I need to account for the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and given that I'm now facing 40% total inflation (20% from each round), getting this deal now is better for me than continuing to negotiate. This even split is fair and should allow us both to walk away satisfied."
