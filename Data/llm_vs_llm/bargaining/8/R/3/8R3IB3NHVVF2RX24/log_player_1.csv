"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This slightly higher split for me accounts for my higher inflation rate (10% vs Bob's 5%). It's a reasonable first offer that leaves both of us with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $5000, but it's worth 10% less than in round 1, so effectively $4500
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
- While an even split might seem fair at first glance, it actually disadvantages me more due to my higher inflation rate
- However, prolonging negotiations will reduce the value further for both of us

Given that we still have many rounds left and I can make a counter-offer that better accounts for the inflation difference, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, I need to account for the cumulative inflation effects. I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for my higher inflation rate while still keeping it attractive enough for Bob to consider.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I propose this split because my higher inflation rate (10% per round) means I'm losing value faster than Bob (5% per round). This offer attempts to balance our different inflation rates while still leaving Bob with a significant portion. If we continue to later rounds, both of us will lose more value, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4800, but it's worth 27.1% less than round 1, so effectively about $3499
- Bob's share of $5200 is worth about $4458 to him after his 14.26% inflation
- If I reject, we go to round 5 where my inflation will be even worse (about 34.8%)
- We've already gone through 4 rounds, and we're losing value quickly
- Bob's offer is actually getting worse for me compared to his previous offer

However, given the accelerating inflation rate and that we've used up 1/3 of our rounds, I should probably accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in later rounds.
