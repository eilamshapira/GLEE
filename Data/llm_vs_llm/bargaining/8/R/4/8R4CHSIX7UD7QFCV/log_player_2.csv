Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, taking into account the inflation I'm facing:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: Alice initially asked for a 60/40 split. I'm offering a slight improvement for her (45/55). While I'm keeping a majority, I'm trying to make it appealing enough that she'll accept, especially given the risk of further inflation eroding the value of the money."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, factoring in the increased inflation on my side (36% loss of value compared to round 1):

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""alice_gain"": 38
}
```

Reasoning: I'm increasing my ask because the money is losing value rapidly *for me*. I'm hoping Alice's inflation is less severe and she'll see this as a reasonable compromise before we both lose even more. I'm still giving her a significant portion (38%) considering the circumstances."
