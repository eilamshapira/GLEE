"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite imbalanced, giving only 10% of the total money to me. Given the inflation effect (5% less value each round), I should consider making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice while accounting for the 5% inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the million dollars. This is a fair division that respects both our interests, and it acknowledges that delay is costly due to inflation. A fair split allows us both to benefit substantially from this opportunity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from $100,000 to $200,000 for me, but it's still quite imbalanced at 20-80 split. Also, I now know that inflation only affects me, not Alice. Due to inflation, my $200,000 would be worth about 9.75% less than in round 1, making it effectively around $180,500 in original value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my money would be worth around 14.75% less than original value. I need to weigh whether a potential better offer would offset this additional loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I understand the inflation only affects me and not Alice, I need to strategize differently. The longer this negotiation goes, the more disadvantaged I become.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a slightly adjusted split that gives Alice a bit more than me. This acknowledges that time favors Alice due to the asymmetric inflation that only affects my portion. Since my gains are already worth 14.75% less than in round 1, we should reach an agreement soon to prevent further devaluation of the total pie. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests while acknowledging the time pressure I face."
