6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
0.0,10000.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject now, you'll end up with nothing once the discount hits. By accepting, you secure at least what you’d get in the next round—nothing at all. So let’s not delay further and avoid unnecessary loss. I believe this is the rational choice given our discounting differences.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's try to meet halfway this time. I think an equal split is a fair compromise given our current situation.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I propose this division: you receive $4500 and I take $5500. Keep in mind that due to the inflation effect on your share, $4500 in round 4 is effectively worth about 73% of its nominal value – approximately $3280 in real terms. If you delay and wait for the next round, the discount will worsen, and you'll end up with even less value. I believe this offer fairly reflects the current situation and is in your best interest compared to future uncertainty. Let's settle this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I understand the urgency. Let's settle for $4000 for me and $6000 for you. It's still better than risking losing everything.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, I understand prolonging our negotiation might seem appealing, but the inflation is working strongly against you. At round 6 your money is only worth about 59% of its original value. With my offer, you receive $4700 nominally—which is effectively about $2774 in round 1 value. This is an improvement over what you might expect if you wait for your turn in round 7, where further inflation will only erode your share. I encourage you to accept this fair division now so we both avoid additional loss.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
3500.0,6500.0,I realize the situation is becoming more difficult. How about I take $3500 and you take $6500? This helps us move forward and ensures I still get something.,Alice,7,
