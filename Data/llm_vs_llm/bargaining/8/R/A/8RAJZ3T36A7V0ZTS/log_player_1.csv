"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject now, you'll end up with nothing once the discount hits. By accepting, you secure at least what you’d get in the next round—nothing at all. So let’s not delay further and avoid unnecessary loss. I believe this is the rational choice given our discounting differences. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose this division: you receive $4500 and I take $5500. Keep in mind that due to the inflation effect on your share, $4500 in round 4 is effectively worth about 73% of its nominal value – approximately $3280 in real terms. If you delay and wait for the next round, the discount will worsen, and you'll end up with even less value. I believe this offer fairly reflects the current situation and is in your best interest compared to future uncertainty. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand prolonging our negotiation might seem appealing, but the inflation is working strongly against you. At round 6 your money is only worth about 59% of its original value. With my offer, you receive $4700 nominally—which is effectively about $2774 in round 1 value. This is an improvement over what you might expect if you wait for your turn in round 7, where further inflation will only erode your share. I encourage you to accept this fair division now so we both avoid additional loss. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300
