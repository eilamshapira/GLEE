"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $100 to Bob, keeping in mind that the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round. I don't know how inflation affects Bob. To start, I'll make a reasonable offer to increase the chance of acceptance and avoid immediate inflation.
