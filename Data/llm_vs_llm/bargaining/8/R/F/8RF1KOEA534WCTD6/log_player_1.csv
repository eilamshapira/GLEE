"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.83, ""bob_gain"": 79.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $20.83 and you receive $79.17. Given that money loses value for me faster than for you in each round, this division reflects our respective time‚Äêpreferences. I believe this is a fair offer if we agree now. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've taken into account the inflation rates and the fact that the money loses value faster for you. I believe this division is more favorable for both of us, given the current situation. Let's agree on this proposal to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
