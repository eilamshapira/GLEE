"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $20.83 and you receive $79.17. Given that money loses value for me faster than for you in each round, this division reflects our respective time‚Äêpreferences. I believe this is a fair offer if we agree now. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and moving to the next round.

If I reject this offer, in the next round, I will make a proposal. However, due to inflation, the $100 will be worth less to both of us. Specifically, it will be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

Given that the money loses value faster for Alice, it might be beneficial for me to reject the offer and propose a division in the next round that takes into account the decreased value of the money for Alice.

Considering this, my decision for now is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

My proposal is to divide the $100 as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I've taken into account the inflation rates and the fact that the money loses value faster for you. I believe this division is more favorable for both of us, given the current situation. Let's agree on this proposal to avoid further devaluation.""}"
