"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of a standard alternating‐offer bargaining game with discounting (the available “pie” shrinks by 20% each round) and assuming fully rational players, the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome in round 1 is as follows. (The analysis roughly goes as follows, working from the final round backward: In round 12 Bob can claim almost the entire remaining amount since if Alice rejects she gets nothing; in round 11 Alice must “pay” Bob just enough (his continuation value) that he is indifferent between accepting now or waiting until round 12; and so on. Repeating this reasoning from round 12 back to round 1 shows that in round 1 the “pie” is worth $10,000 and Bob’s continuation payoff coming from being the proposer in round 2 is about $4,826.22, so Alice can keep the rest.) 

Thus, in round 1 Alice’s equilibrium offer is to propose:
 • Alice: approximately $5,173.78 
 • Bob: approximately $4,826.22 

Here is the JSON offer: 

{""alice_gain"": 5173.78, ""bob_gain"": 4826.22}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
