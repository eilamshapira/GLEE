"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the situation:

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 10% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's Offer:** I get $0, Bob gets $100.

In this case, I must accept the offer, because if I reject, the game ends, and I will receive nothing, also considering the inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
