"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the fact that my money is worth 5% less each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the inflation penalty I face in future rounds. This is a fair split that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
