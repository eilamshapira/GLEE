"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to account for our respective time‐preferences (my money losing only 5% per round and yours 20%), I’m proposing an immediate split of $8333 for me and $1667 for you. This division reflects how waiting hurts you more, so I hope you find it fair to close the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $1667 while taking $8333 for herself, citing our different inflation rates as justification.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us - but it decreases much more for me (20%) than for Alice (5%). In the next round, the $10,000 would be worth only $8,000 to me but $9,500 to Alice.

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, she's right that I have less bargaining power due to my higher inflation rate. If we continue to negotiate, I lose more value than she does each round.

Given these considerations, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in future rounds.
