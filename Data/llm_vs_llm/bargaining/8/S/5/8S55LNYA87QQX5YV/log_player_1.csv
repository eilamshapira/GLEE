"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I suggest this split where I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800, which is close to 50-50 but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. This is a reasonable offer that respects both parties while giving Bob a substantial portion that should be acceptable to avoid the 10% inflation penalty in the next round."
