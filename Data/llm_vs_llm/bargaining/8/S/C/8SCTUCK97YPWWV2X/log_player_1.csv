"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm facing a 10% devaluation each round. This actually makes it a more equal division in terms of real value. If we delay, I lose purchasing power while you don't.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 10% devaluation you're facing, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. However, I expect some compromise since I'm not affected by the devaluation. Let's find a mutually beneficial split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
