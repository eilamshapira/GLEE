"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm facing a 10% devaluation each round. This actually makes it a more equal division in terms of real value. If we delay, I lose purchasing power while you don't. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice is facing a 10% devaluation each round and I'm not, it's likely that waiting will be more beneficial for me. Her offer of a 60-40 split in her favor doesn't seem very appealing, especially considering that the value of the money will decrease for her but not for me in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is devaluing by 10% each round and mine isn't, I can afford to make a slightly more aggressive offer. However, I still want to leave some room for negotiation.

For round 2, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This takes into account the devaluation Alice is facing, but also acknowledges that I'm the one making the offer this round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the 10% devaluation you're facing, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. However, I expect some compromise since I'm not affected by the devaluation. Let's find a mutually beneficial split.""}"
