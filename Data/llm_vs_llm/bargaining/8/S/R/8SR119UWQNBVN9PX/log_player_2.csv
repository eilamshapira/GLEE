"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:
* Alice is offering me 4000$ (40%) while keeping 6000$ (60%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, there will be a 5% inflation penalty, so the total amount will be worth 9500$ instead of 10000$
* While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the inflation cost and risk of extended negotiation may outweigh the potential gains

I think this initial offer, while not perfectly equal, is reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty risk. I'll accept.
