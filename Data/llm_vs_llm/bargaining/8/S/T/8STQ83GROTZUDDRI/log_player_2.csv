"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect - if I reject and we go to the next round, any money I get will be worth 10% less to me.

If I reject and propose my own offer next round, there's no guarantee Alice will accept it, and my money will already be worth less. A guaranteed $50 now is better than a potentially higher amount that's devalued later.
