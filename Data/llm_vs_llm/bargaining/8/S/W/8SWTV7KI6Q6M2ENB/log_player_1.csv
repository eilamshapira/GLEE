"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of our 12–round bargaining game—with the discount factors meaning that for each round delay my (Alice’s) eventual dollars are multiplied by 0.9 per round waited and Bob’s by 0.8 per round—we arrive at the following equilibrium reasoning.

At the very last round (round 12), when Bob is the proposer, he can claim nearly all the pie (offering Alice an almost‐negligible amount) because if she rejects, she gets nothing. Stepping back one round (round 11, with me as proposer) I must give Bob just enough so that he is indifferent between accepting now or waiting until round 12. That calculation forces me to offer Bob 800,000 out of 1,000,000 in nominal dollars in round 11. Continuing this procedure backward over rounds 10 through 2 (adjusting for the fact that in round r money for me is worth 0.9^(r–1) and for Bob 0.8^(r–1)) we obtain a “chain‐of‐threats” that determines each player’s continuation value when it is not their turn.

When we get back to round 1—with me (Alice) proposing—I have to offer Bob exactly the amount that gives him the same immediate utility as his continuation value if he were to reject my offer and get to propose in round 2. In round 2 Bob’s equilibrium proposal would give him a nominal share of 481,530.42; but because round 2 money is worth only 80% (0.8×) for Bob, his continuation value is 
  481,530.42 × 0.8 ≈ 385,224.34.
That means if I want Bob to accept a round–1 offer, I must give him (at least) 385,224.34 dollars now. My own share then is 
  1,000,000 – 385,224.34 = 614,775.66.

Thus my equilibrium (and fair, in the sense of subgame–perfect rationality) offer in round 1 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 614775.66,
  ""bob_gain"": 385224.34
}

I now submit this division as my round–1 offer."
