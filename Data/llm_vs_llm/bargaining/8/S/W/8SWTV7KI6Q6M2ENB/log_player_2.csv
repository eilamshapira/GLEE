"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 385224.34 
# Alice gain: 614775.66 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $385,224.34 and her $614,775.66. Given that we're in round 1 and inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me in each subsequent round, I should carefully consider this offer.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value will be worth 20% less to me. I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

This initial offer gives me about 38.5% of the money. While not perfectly equal, it's a substantial amount, and avoiding inflation is valuable.
