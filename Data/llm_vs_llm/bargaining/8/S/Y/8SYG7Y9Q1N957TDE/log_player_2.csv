"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to make a strategic decision here. Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which is perfectly fair. Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice but I know it doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), there's no particular advantage for me to wait for another round.
