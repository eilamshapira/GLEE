67.29,32.71,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement. I get $67.29 and you get $32.71. Accepting now is in your best interest since waiting means you’d incur a 20% devaluation each round (and I a 5% drop), so your future prospects won’t be as good. Let’s close the deal now rather than face harsher discounts in later rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of losing value with each round.",Bob,2,

33.0,67.0,"Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 3. I suggest we split the $100 so that you get $67 and I get $33. With your share in this round discounted by 40% (making it effectively about $40.20) and mine discounted by 10% (about $29.70), this deal gives you a marginally better outcome than waiting for the next round where further devaluation will bite you even harder. Accepting now avoids the risk of an even steeper loss in value on your side. I believe this is a fair and prudent move for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a bit more than an even split, but I won't accept a deal that's so heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at compromise, but I'm going to reject this offer. Although you’re offering me a larger nominal share than an even split at $40, when adjusting for our respective inflation factors (for me, a 14.26% drop and for you a 48.8% drop), my effective value amounts to about $34.30 while yours comes to roughly $30.72 – which suggests there's still margin for improvement. Given that if we continue to round 5 I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division, I believe I can secure a better effective outcome for both of us (especially since your position gets hit harder by inflation each round). Let’s keep negotiating to find a deal that works better for both parties.",Alice,4,reject
24.0,76.0,"Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 5. Time is of the essence, as waiting further only compounds the discount: my money loses value at about 18.55% compared to round 1, and yours at roughly 59.04%. In this proposal, you’d get $76, which, after discounting, is worth about $31.13 to you – a slight improvement over what you’d face by holding out. I’d receive $24 (worth about $19.55 effective), which reflects the fact that my money holds value better in this round. I believe this division fairly accounts for our respective discount rates and ensures that neither of us suffers unnecessarily from further inflation. I hope you’ll agree that it’s in both our best interests to lock in a deal now.",Alice,5,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference this time. I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid further devaluation, but we need to find a compromise that's fair to both of us.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Given that my share would be worth about 27.08 (after a 22.62% decrease) and yours about 21.30 (after a 67.23% decrease), accepting this offer now prevents further devaluation. Let's lock it in and avoid risking even steeper losses in the coming rounds.",Alice,6,accept
