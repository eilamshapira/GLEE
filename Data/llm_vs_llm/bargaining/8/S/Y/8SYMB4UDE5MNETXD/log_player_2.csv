"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement. I get $67.29 and you get $32.71. Accepting now is in your best interest since waiting means you’d incur a 20% devaluation each round (and I a 5% drop), so your future prospects won’t be as good. Let’s close the deal now rather than face harsher discounts in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 32.71 
# Alice gain: 67.29

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 3. I suggest we split the $100 so that you get $67 and I get $33. With your share in this round discounted by 40% (making it effectively about $40.20) and mine discounted by 10% (about $29.70), this deal gives you a marginally better outcome than waiting for the next round where further devaluation will bite you even harder. Accepting now avoids the risk of an even steeper loss in value on your side. I believe this is a fair and prudent move for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 67 
# Alice gain: 33

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 5. Time is of the essence, as waiting further only compounds the discount: my money loses value at about 18.55% compared to round 1, and yours at roughly 59.04%. In this proposal, you’d get $76, which, after discounting, is worth about $31.13 to you – a slight improvement over what you’d face by holding out. I’d receive $24 (worth about $19.55 effective), which reflects the fact that my money holds value better in this round. I believe this division fairly accounts for our respective discount rates and ensures that neither of us suffers unnecessarily from further inflation. I hope you’ll agree that it’s in both our best interests to lock in a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 76 
# Alice gain: 24
