"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $5,000. This seems fair at first glance.
However, if I reject now, I can make my own offer next round.
The catch is that due to inflation, my money will be worth 5% less each round.
After one round, $5,000 would effectively become $4,750 for me.

Since this is a fair first offer and inflation will reduce my purchasing power if I wait, I should accept this offer.
