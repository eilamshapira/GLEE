"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I think a 55-45 split is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- My original offer of $60 would only be worth $54 in the next round
- Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $42.75 to me) is not great, but waiting might make things worse
- Bob seems to be more affected by inflation (20% vs my 5%), which could give me leverage in the next round
- However, the risk of further devaluation might outweigh potential gains

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Bob seems to be more affected by inflation, which gives me better bargaining power for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob is more affected by inflation (20% vs my 5%), and we're now in round 3, I should leverage this but also be reasonable to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I've lowered my request from my initial 60-40 split, and I'm offering you 45%. This is a fair compromise, and we should agree now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""}"
