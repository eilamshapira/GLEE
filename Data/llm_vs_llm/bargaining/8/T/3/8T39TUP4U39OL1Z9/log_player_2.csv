Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I've lowered my request from my initial 60-40 split, and I'm offering you 45%. This is a fair compromise, and we should agree now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
