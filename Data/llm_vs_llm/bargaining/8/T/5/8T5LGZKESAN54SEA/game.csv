285714.0,714286.0,"Hi Alice, I know waiting only hurts us both due to the devaluation. Given that your alternative in the next round would fetch you roughly $228571 in real value, I’m offering you $285714 now, which is strictly better. I believe this offer fairly reflects our differing discount rates—I'm getting a larger share because the delay hurts me less (only 10% per round) compared to your 20% loss. Let's settle now to avoid further erosion of value for both of us.",Bob,2,

81000.0,919000.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject and become the proposer in round 5, your deal will be heavily constrained by the fact that I, as the responder, have a much lower discount rate. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer me nearly 90% of the pie to keep me from walking away—leaving you roughly 100000 in physical dollars, which with a 0.4096 multiplier amounts to about $41000 in value for you. Under our current round 4 multipliers (0.729 for me and 0.512 for you), my offer gives you 81000 physical dollars, worth about $41472. This is marginally better than waiting. I believe this offer, with me keeping 919000 and you receiving 81000, properly accounts for the inflation penalty we face. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,
