"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know waiting only hurts us both due to the devaluation. Given that your alternative in the next round would fetch you roughly $228571 in real value, I’m offering you $285714 now, which is strictly better. I believe this offer fairly reflects our differing discount rates—I'm getting a larger share because the delay hurts me less (only 10% per round) compared to your 20% loss. Let's settle now to avoid further erosion of value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob makes a compelling argument, considering the inflation rates. However, I still need to evaluate if the offer is fair to me.

Given the numbers, I can calculate the real value of the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider this devaluation.

My decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I need to make a competitive offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round, I'll take that into account.

After two rounds, the value of the money for me has decreased by 36% (20% in Round 1 and another 20% * 0.8 = 16% in Round 2, combined = 36%), and for Bob, it has decreased by 19% (10% in Round 1 and another 10% * 0.9 = 9% in Round 2, combined = 19%).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Let's settle before further devaluation, a more even split considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject and become the proposer in round 5, your deal will be heavily constrained by the fact that I, as the responder, have a much lower discount rate. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer me nearly 90% of the pie to keep me from walking away—leaving you roughly 100000 in physical dollars, which with a 0.4096 multiplier amounts to about $41000 in value for you. Under our current round 4 multipliers (0.729 for me and 0.512 for you), my offer gives you 81000 physical dollars, worth about $41472. This is marginally better than waiting. I believe this offer, with me keeping 919000 and you receiving 81000, properly accounts for the inflation penalty we face. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 81000 
# Bob gain: 919000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's analysis of the situation and the impact of inflation on our potential gains is accurate. Considering the significant devaluation of the money for me, I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer.

Given the numbers, accepting this offer would give me approximately $41,472 in value, whereas waiting for the next round and making an offer could result in a much lower value for me, as Bob pointed out.

My decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
