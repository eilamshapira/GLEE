Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I know waiting only hurts us both due to the devaluation. Given that your alternative in the next round would fetch you roughly $228,571 in real value, I’m offering you $285,714 now, which is strictly better. I believe this offer fairly reflects our differing discount rates—I'm getting a larger share because the delay hurts me less (only 10% per round) compared to your 20% loss. Let's settle now to avoid further erosion of value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle before further devaluation, a more even split considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 919000, ""alice_gain"": 81000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: if you reject and become the proposer in round 5, your deal will be heavily constrained by the fact that I, as the responder, have a much lower discount rate. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer me nearly 90% of the pie to keep me from walking away—leaving you roughly 100,000 in physical dollars, which with a 0.4096 multiplier amounts to about $41,000 in value for you. Under our current round 4 multipliers (0.729 for me and 0.512 for you), my offer gives you 81,000 physical dollars, worth about $41,472. This is marginally better than waiting. I believe this offer, with me keeping 919,000 and you receiving 81,000, properly accounts for the inflation penalty we face. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.""}"
