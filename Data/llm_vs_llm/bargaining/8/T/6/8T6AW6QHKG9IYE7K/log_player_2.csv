"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a significant amount of money ($4,000), I believe we can achieve a more equitable distribution. Since this is the first round and I'll get to make a counter-offer next, I'll reject this offer. The 5% inflation means the total will be worth $9,500 next round, but I can propose a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This gives us both $5,000, which is fair and equitable. The money is now worth $9,500 due to 5% inflation, but my offer is based on dividing the original $10,000 amount equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,200, which shows some movement toward compromise. However, I still think we can reach a more equitable distribution. With inflation reducing the total value by 9.75% since the first round, the entire amount is now worth approximately $9,025. I'll make another proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100}

I'm proposing a nearly equal split where Alice gets a slightly larger share. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges her initial position while moving toward equality. After 3 rounds of inflation, the money is worth about 14.3% less than the original amount, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon to minimize further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by another $100, which shows continued movement toward compromise, but it's still quite far from an equal split. With inflation now at 18.55%, the total value has decreased to about $8,145. If we continue negotiating, we'll lose more money to inflation. However, I think there's still room for a more balanced agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250}

I'm offering Alice $5,250 and taking $4,750 myself. This represents a fair compromise that moves significantly toward Alice's position while still giving me a reasonable portion. We've already lost nearly 20% to inflation, and we'll lose even more if we continue negotiating. This offer is designed to strike a balance that should be acceptable to both of us so we can conclude this negotiation before inflation erodes our gains further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by another $100, continuing the pattern of small incremental increases. With inflation now at 26.49%, the total money has decreased in value to about $7,351. We're more than halfway through our 12 rounds, and the money is losing significant value with each passing round. While her offer still favors her, the continued negotiation is costing us both. I'll accept this offer to stop further losses from inflation.
