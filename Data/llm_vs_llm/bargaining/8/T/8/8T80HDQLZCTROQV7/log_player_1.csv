"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the looming inflation that will significantly affect my gains in later rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a favorable split now, recognizing the money's value diminishes quickly for me. I hope this offer is tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze this carefully.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4800, Bob gets $5200.

*   **Inflation:** My share is now worth 20% less than in round 1. So, $4800 now is equivalent to $4800 * 0.8 = $3840 from round 1.

I need to consider if rejecting leads to a better outcome, weighing the risk of further inflation and the limited number of rounds. If I reject, I'll have to propose an offer in round 3, and my gain will be worth 40% less than in round 1.

Let's analyze my potential offer if I reject. Since Bob's gain is not subject to inflation, I would propose a split that benefits me slightly more than the current offer. My goal is to get more than $3840 in original round 1 money.

Given the limited number of rounds and the potential for further unfavorable offers from Bob, I will reluctantly accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
