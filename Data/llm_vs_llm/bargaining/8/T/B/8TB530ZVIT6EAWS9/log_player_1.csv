"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers both our interests, accounting for the different inflation rates that affect us (5% for me, 10% for Bob). The key insight is that Bob has a higher inflation penalty, so he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since you face 10% inflation per round versus my 5%, it's in both our interests to settle early. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in negotiations due to the inflation difference.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we both need to consider the impact of inflation. To make it fair and ensure we both get a reasonable share, I propose an equal split. This way, we can both walk away with a fair amount before inflation affects our gains too much. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's equal split offer or continue to the next round.

If I accept: I get $500,000 now, which is worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1, so effectively worth $475,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject: 
- We go to round 3 where I can make a new offer
- But the money will be worth another 5% less to me (10% total from round 1)
- And worth another 10% less to Bob (20% total from round 1)
- This gives me leverage to potentially get more, but with diminishing returns

Since I initially offered myself $550,000 and Bob $450,000, and now Bob is offering me $500,000 (which is lower than my initial proposal but still reasonable), I need to consider if pushing for more is worth the inflation penalty.

The equal split is fair, and while slightly less than I initially proposed, avoiding another round of inflation makes it reasonable to accept.
