"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since you face 10% inflation per round versus my 5%, it's in both our interests to settle early. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in negotiations due to the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation rates, but given that I face a higher inflation rate, I would like to propose a more equitable split. Let's settle on an amount that reflects the urgency for me to secure a better deal earlier in the game."
