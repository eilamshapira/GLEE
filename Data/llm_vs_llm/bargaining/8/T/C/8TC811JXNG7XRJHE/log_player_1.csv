"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 so that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since any delay reduces my share's actual value by 5% per round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the decreasing value. How about we turn the tables? You get $45, and I'll take $55. It's a fair counter-offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. While I understand your position regarding the time pressure, I must also consider that each extra round reduces my share's value by 5%. Considering this, I believe it's best for both of us to finalize the deal now. I accept your offer of $45 for me and $55 for you.""}"
