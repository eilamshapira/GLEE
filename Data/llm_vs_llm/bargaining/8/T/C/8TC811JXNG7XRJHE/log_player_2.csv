"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 so that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since any delay reduces my share's actual value by 5% per round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
