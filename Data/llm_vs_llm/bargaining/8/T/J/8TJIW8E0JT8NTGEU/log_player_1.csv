"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, taking into account the inflation for me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion. Since I'm facing inflation, securing a larger amount upfront is beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is 50/50. Let's calculate the value for me. The money is worth 10% less, so $50 is worth $45 to me now.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

My reasoning: Getting $45 is better than risking further inflation in the next round. While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the potential loss from further inflation outweighs the possible gain from holding out."
