"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. Since there's no inflation for me, this offer maintains its full value regardless of which round we settle in. This is a fair split, but I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55-45 split which is still quite fair but gives me a bit more. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a better deal, but I also want to be reasonable enough that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has countered with exactly the same split I proposed (55% for me, 45% for her). This is interesting because she rejected this same proposal when I made it, but now she's offering it herself. I also learn that inflation is affecting Alice's value of the money by 19% since the first round, which explains her increased willingness to settle.

Since this offer gives me $550,000 which is better than the initial 50-50 split, and there's no inflation affecting my value of the money, I should accept this offer.
