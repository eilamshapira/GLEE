"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. The $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 in real value.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In round 2, the money I gain was worth 90% of its original value. Now, in round 3, it's worth 90% * 90% = 81% of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when making my decision. The $350,000 offered to me is actually worth $350,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $350,000 * 0.729 = $255,150 in real value.

Considering this, I think this offer is quite low, but I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease for me if I reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round in round 4, and now in round 5, it's worth 10% less again, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In round 4, the money I gain was worth 72.9% of its original value. Now, in round 5, it's worth 72.9% * 0.9 = 65.61% of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when making my decision. The $300,000 offered to me is actually worth $300,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $300,000 * 0.5905 = $177,150 in real value.

At this point, the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money I would receive, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the next round. I think it's time to consider accepting an offer, even if it's not ideal.
