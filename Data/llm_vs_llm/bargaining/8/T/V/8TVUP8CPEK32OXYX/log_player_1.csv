"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, and we don't know how it affects you, this seems like a reasonable division that benefits us both equally.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the initial offer, but I'm experiencing inflation. I need a slightly larger share to make up for the decreasing value of the money over time. This offer still gives you a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
