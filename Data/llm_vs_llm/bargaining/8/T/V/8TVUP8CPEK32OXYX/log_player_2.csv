"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, and we don't know how it affects you, this seems like a reasonable division that benefits us both equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I am experiencing inflation. Accepting this offer means I lose potential future value if I can secure a better deal later. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate, given she doesn't seem affected by inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the initial offer, but I'm experiencing inflation. I need a slightly larger share to make up for the decreasing value of the money over time. This offer still gives you a significant sum.""}"
