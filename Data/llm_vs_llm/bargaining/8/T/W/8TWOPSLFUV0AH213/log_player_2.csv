"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 5% less next round
2. Alice might respond to a more aggressive offer with a rejection
3. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered the most fair division

Given these factors, especially that we'd lose value by continuing to negotiate, I'll accept this fair offer.
