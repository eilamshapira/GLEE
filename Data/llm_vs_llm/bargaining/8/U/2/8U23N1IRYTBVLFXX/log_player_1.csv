"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, starting with a slightly larger share makes sense for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, and 36% less than in Round 1 (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). 

To calculate the value, I'll consider the original amount and then apply the inflation. 

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a larger share to make it worth my while""
}
```"
