"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable 45/55 split. This is much fairer than your 90/10 offer, and given that I'm facing 10% inflation per round, it's reasonable to settle this now. We both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
