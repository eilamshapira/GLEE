"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 90/10. This is a generous offer considering inflation will eat into my share each round. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 90/10 split in Alice's favor, offering me $100,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
4. $100,000 now is better than potentially getting more later but with 10% less value
5. However, this split is quite unfair, and I can probably negotiate better terms

I will reject this offer. Even with inflation, I can propose a more equitable split in the next round. A 90/10 split is too extreme.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering both the inflation factor and fairness:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable 45/55 split. This is much fairer than your 90/10 offer, and given that I'm facing 10% inflation per round, it's reasonable to settle this now. We both benefit from a quick resolution.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a near-equal split but giving Alice slightly more (55%) to incentivize acceptance
2. This is much more equitable than the initial 90/10 proposal
3. If Alice rejects, she'll face making the next proposal with me having 10% more inflation pressure, but she might also face some inflation pressure herself
4. The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit from quick resolution"
