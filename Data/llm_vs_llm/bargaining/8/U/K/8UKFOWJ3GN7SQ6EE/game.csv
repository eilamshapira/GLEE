6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider that rejecting offers and extending negotiations actually hurts your position more than mine due to that same 5% inflation effect. This 55-45 split is fair considering I face no inflation and you'll lose value each round we delay. If we keep negotiating, your share will continue to decrease in value to you. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, while I've reduced my request from the initial offer, I need to account for the inflation that's already affected me. A 58-42 split is fair - if we converted to present value, this split is much closer to 50-50 when accounting for the 10% inflation I've already experienced. Let's agree and finish this now.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial position. Let's consider the facts: we're now in round 4, and you're experiencing significant inflation effects that will only increase with each round. At this point, your $4800 is already worth less to you due to inflation, while my amount maintains its value. This 52-48 split is actually very fair when accounting for inflation effects. If we continue negotiating, your position weakens with each round due to the 5% inflation you face. I suggest we agree now - this offer is genuinely reasonable considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,4,
