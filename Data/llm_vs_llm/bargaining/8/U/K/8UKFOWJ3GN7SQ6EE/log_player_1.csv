"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider that rejecting offers and extending negotiations actually hurts your position more than mine due to that same 5% inflation effect. This 55-45 split is fair considering I face no inflation and you'll lose value each round we delay. If we keep negotiating, your share will continue to decrease in value to you. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The declining value due to inflation is precisely why I need a larger share - Bob is trying to use the inflation pressure against me. At 5% inflation per round, my $4500 is already worth less than his $5500, and this gap would only widen over time. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for the inflation impact."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, while I've reduced my request from the initial offer, I need to account for the inflation that's already affected me. A 58-42 split is fair - if we converted to present value, this split is much closer to 50-50 when accounting for the 10% inflation I've already experienced. Let's agree and finish this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial position. Let's consider the facts: we're now in round 4, and you're experiencing significant inflation effects that will only increase with each round. At this point, your $4800 is already worth less to you due to inflation, while my amount maintains its value. This 52-48 split is actually very fair when accounting for inflation effects. If we continue negotiating, your position weakens with each round due to the 5% inflation you face. I suggest we agree now - this offer is genuinely reasonable considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob makes a valid point - with the 14.26% inflation I've already experienced, continuing to negotiate would likely result in worse outcomes for me. While not ideal, this split is reasonable given the circumstances, and the inflation penalty makes further negotiation risky."
