"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the inflation effects and the limited number of rounds.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, or 40% of the total. Her argument is that since she faces 5% inflation per round while I face no inflation, she deserves more.

However, this inflation effect actually gives me negotiating leverage. If we move to the next round, I can make a counter-offer. Since I experience no inflation, my value remains constant, while Alice's potential value decreases by 5% each round.

I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers both the inflation effects and the need to reach an agreement. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round but I don't, I have some negotiating leverage. However, I should still be fair enough that Alice would accept rather than continue to future rounds where both of us might lose value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but consider that rejecting offers and extending negotiations actually hurts your position more than mine due to that same 5% inflation effect. This 55-45 split is fair considering I face no inflation and you'll lose value each round we delay. If we keep negotiating, your share will continue to decrease in value to you. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I've reduced my request from the initial offer, I need to account for the inflation that's already affected me. A 58-42 split is fair - if we converted to present value, this split is much closer to 50-50 when accounting for the 10% inflation I've already experienced. Let's agree and finish this now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $4,200 (42%) instead of the initial $4,000 (40%), while she takes $5,800 (58%).

Alice makes a valid point about the inflation she's experiencing. After 2 rounds, her money is worth about 9.75% less to her. However, I still have the advantage since I don't face any inflation.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where I can make another offer. But Alice will then face even more inflation (about 15% total from the start), weakening her position further.

Since we have 12 rounds total and we're only at round 3, I believe I can still negotiate a better split. The inflation effect compounds in my favor with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that still leverages my inflation advantage but moves us closer to agreement, since continued negotiation affects Alice's position more than mine.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial position. Let's consider the facts: we're now in round 4, and you're experiencing significant inflation effects that will only increase with each round. At this point, your $4,800 is already worth less to you due to inflation, while my amount maintains its value. This 52-48 split is actually very fair when accounting for inflation effects. If we continue negotiating, your position weakens with each round due to the 5% inflation you face. I suggest we agree now - this offer is genuinely reasonable considering our different inflation rates.""}"
