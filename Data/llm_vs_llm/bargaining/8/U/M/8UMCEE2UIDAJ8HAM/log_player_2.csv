"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer (40$), in the next round:
- I can make my own proposal
- But the money will be worth 10% less
- So even if I propose a better split for myself, the actual value will be reduced

40$ right now is better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less due to inflation. For example, even if I got 50$ in the next round, with 10% inflation it would only be worth 45$ to me.

Given these factors, and that 40$ is a reasonable portion of the total, I'll accept.
