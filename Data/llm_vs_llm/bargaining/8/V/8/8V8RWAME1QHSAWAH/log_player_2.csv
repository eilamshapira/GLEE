"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I should consider the inflation rates. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round where the total is worth 5% less to me but 20% less to Alice. This gives me negotiation leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll offer a split that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that time pressure affects Alice more significantly than me due to her higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%). This gives her a strong incentive to accept now rather than continuing to future rounds where her money would be worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has moved from her initial 50-50 split to offering me $5,200 (52%). She's acknowledging that she faces higher inflation pressure than I do. However, I still have a negotiating advantage due to our different inflation rates.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where my inflation will be around 15% and hers will be about 49%. The difference in our inflation rates continues to grow, giving me more leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll increase my offer to account for the growing inflation difference and to make a more compelling proposal to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. With Alice now facing nearly 50% inflation in the next round compared to my 15%, accepting this offer becomes increasingly rational for her. This split acknowledges our asymmetric inflation rates while still providing Alice with a substantial amount that's worth more to her now than a potentially larger amount in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5700 
# Alice gain: 4300 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to me significantly, now offering $5,700 (57%). She's clearly responding to the inflation pressure. 

Let's analyze the situation:
- I'm now facing 18.55% inflation from the original value
- Alice is facing 59.04% inflation from the original value
- The gap in our inflation rates continues to widen
- We're in round 5 of 12, so we still have time, but the inflation is accelerating

Alice is moving toward my position, which shows her recognition of the inflation dynamics. However, I still have negotiating leverage because of our different inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to reflect our current positions and the accelerating inflation differential.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. Alice's money is now worth less than half its original value due to her 59% inflation, while mine has only lost about 19%. If she rejects this offer, her next-round inflation will be around 67%, making her portion significantly less valuable. This offer provides her with $3,000 now, which has more present value to her than a larger amount in future rounds. The accelerating inflation differential strongly incentivizes her to accept this reasonable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6200 
# Alice gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me again, now offering $6,200 (62%). She's continuing to move in my direction as her inflation rate (now at 73.79%) significantly outpaces mine (26.49%).

Let's consider the situation:
- We're now in round 7 of 12
- Alice's money has lost nearly 3/4 of its original value
- My money has lost about 1/4 of its original value
- If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

Alice's continued improvement of her offers suggests she understands the time pressure, but I still have leverage due to the inflation differential. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard as we're over halfway through our rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll refine my offer to balance maximizing my gain while increasing our chances of reaching an agreement before we run out of rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 7200, ""alice_gain"": 2800}

I'm proposing a 72-28 split. With Alice's inflation now over 73% and rising faster than mine, the time pressure on her is extreme. At this point in round 8, we have only 4 more rounds before we both receive nothing. Alice's portion has already lost nearly three-quarters of its original value, making $2,800 now worth more to her than a potentially larger amount in later rounds. This offer acknowledges both our asymmetric inflation rates and the approaching deadline while still providing Alice with a meaningful portion."
