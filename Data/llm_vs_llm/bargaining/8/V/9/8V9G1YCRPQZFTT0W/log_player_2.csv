"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $1,000,000. Due to inflation, for me (Bob), it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500.
For Alice, it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.80)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.64 = $640,000.

Alice's offer is $475,000 for me and $525,000 for her. Given the inflation, this translates to:
$475,000 / $902,500 = approximately 52.6% of the total value for me
$525,000 / $640,000 = approximately 82% of the total value for Alice

I'll reject this offer, as it seems unfair considering the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the money.

The original amount was $1,000,000. Due to inflation, for me (Bob), it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.95)^3 = $1,000,000 * 0.857375 = $857,375.
For Alice, it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.80)^3 = $1,000,000 * 0.512 = $512,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the ratio of the actual values. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This way, I'm offering a larger share to myself, taking into account the inflation and its effect on the value of the money for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $1,000,000. Due to inflation, for me (Bob), it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.95)^4 = $1,000,000 * 0.814506 = $814,506.
For Alice, it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.80)^4 = $1,000,000 * 0.4096 = $409,600.

Alice's offer is $520,000 for me and $480,000 for her. Given the inflation, this translates to:
$520,000 / $814,506 = approximately 63.8% of the total value for me
$480,000 / $409,600 = approximately 117.2% of the total value for Alice

However, considering that Alice's share is worth less due to the higher inflation rate, I'll re-evaluate the offer. The offer seems relatively fair, given the circumstances.
