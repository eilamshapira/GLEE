"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair offer. Let's both gain and avoid inflation eating our share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair. Alice is proposing that I get $45 and she gets $55 out of the $100. 

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but we'd both lose 10% to inflation, meaning we'd only be dividing $90 total. My counteroffer would likely aim for at least $45, but there's risk Alice rejects it and we lose another 10%.

Given that the offer gives me close to half (45%), and rejecting would subject both of us to a 10% loss from inflation, I'll accept this offer.
