"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value I'd receive from Bob's offer would be 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems somewhat one-sided in his favor. I'd like to negotiate a better deal, hoping that in the next round, I can make a more favorable proposal or that Bob will reconsider.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by another 20% (making it 64% of the original value, since 80% * 80% = 64%), I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering he is not affected by inflation.

My offer will slightly favor Bob to encourage acceptance, but I'll aim to keep it as balanced as possible under the circumstances:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than half, acknowledging the disadvantage I'm under due to inflation, while still trying to secure a significant share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation reducing the value of my gain to 51.2% of the original (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), the $380,000 offered by Bob would actually be worth $380,000 * 0.512 = $194,560 to me.

Considering this significant reduction in value due to inflation, Bob's offer, although not ideal, starts to look more reasonable. The gap between what I would receive and what Bob would receive is substantial, but given the inflation's impact, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further inflation in subsequent rounds.

Given the circumstances, I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of my potential share.
