"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the higher depreciation rate I face, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I would gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the $500,000 offered to me is actually worth $400,000 in terms of the original value (since 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000). 

Considering this, and the fact that Bob's offer gives him $500,000 which is only 5% less in value for him (or $475,000 in original value, since 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000), it seems like a fair offer given the circumstances of the game, especially since I would be getting less value in subsequent rounds due to the higher inflation rate affecting me.
