"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject and go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me, meaning the total $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me. My potential counteroffer would be made on this reduced value.

While Alice's offer gives me less than half, accepting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,000 in the next round just to break even considering inflation.
