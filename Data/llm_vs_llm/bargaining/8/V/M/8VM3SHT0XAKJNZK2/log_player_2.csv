"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair initially, I need to consider the different inflation rates. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Alice's (10%), waiting is more costly for me than for her. If I reject, by the next round my potential gain will already be reduced.
