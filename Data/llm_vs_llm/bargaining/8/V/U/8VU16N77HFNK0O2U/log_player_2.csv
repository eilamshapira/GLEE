"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
* If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make an offer
* $400,000 now is better than $450,000 next round due to the 10% inflation
* We still have many rounds left, but each delay costs me 10%
* 40% is a significant portion and getting it now avoids inflation risk

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes taking a good offer now better than risking delays.
