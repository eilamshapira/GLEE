"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than $44.44 in the next round (because $44.44 will be worth $40 after 10% inflation)

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. Plus, there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within 12 rounds.
