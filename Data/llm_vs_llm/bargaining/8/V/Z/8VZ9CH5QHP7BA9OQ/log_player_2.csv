"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting $40 out of $100 now is better than making a counter-offer next round, considering the 5% inflation penalty.

If I reject, the value in the next round would effectively be $95 for me. I would need to get more than $40/$95 ≈ 42.1% of that $95 to do better than accepting $40 now.

Since I'd be making the offer next round, I could potentially get more than $40, but there's also risk Alice would reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds and more inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will accept, considering she offered me $40 in the first round. If she rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where she makes the next offer, but my money will be worth another 5% less (total 10% inflation for me).

I'll offer a split that's slightly more favorable to Alice than a 50-50 split, acknowledging her first position advantage while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you $55, which is close to what you proposed before. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome without risking further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

The current offer is $42.50 for me. With 9.75% inflation, the real value to me is approximately $42.50 × (1-0.0975) = $38.36.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the money will be worth 14.75% less than the original value. If we assume the total remains at $100, the maximum real value I could get (even with the entire $100) would be $100 × (1-0.1475) = $85.25.

Alice has increased her offer from $40 to $42.50, showing some willingness to compromise. If I reject again, the inflation penalty gets worse, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer in round 4.

Given the inflation penalty and the improved offer, I should accept.
