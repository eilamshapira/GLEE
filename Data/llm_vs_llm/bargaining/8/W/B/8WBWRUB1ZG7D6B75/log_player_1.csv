"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose value too.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us and prevents further value loss from inflation. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - you may face inflation effects too. Let's conclude this efficiently with a balanced outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept this offer now, my $5000 is actually worth $4000 (20% less)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth even less (40% less)
3. I started by asking for $6000, but $4000 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds
4. Bob is making a reasonable argument about stopping value loss
