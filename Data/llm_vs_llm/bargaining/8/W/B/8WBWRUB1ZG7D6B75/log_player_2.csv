"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose value too. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider both Alice's offer and the impact of inflation on the value of the money for me if I reject.

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, while taking 6000$ for herself. If I reject and we move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the 10,000$ would effectively be worth 9,500$ from my perspective.

While a 50-50 split would be ideal, I need to weigh the cost of continuing negotiation against the potential gain. If I make a counter-offer, I might be able to get more than 4000$, but I'll already be working with a reduced value pool from my perspective.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation risk we both face while seeking a more equitable split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us and prevents further value loss from inflation. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - you may face inflation effects too. Let's conclude this efficiently with a balanced outcome.""}"
