"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that inflation affects me by 10% per round, I need a bit more to account for the diminishing value. This split is fair considering this inflation factor, and we can settle now without losing more value to future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of 50-50. I believe this is fair for both of us and allows us to settle without further inflation affecting our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
