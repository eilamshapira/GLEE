"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation penalty that affects me but not Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, since I'll face 20% inflation in future rounds if we don't agree now, while Bob faces no inflation penalty. This gives us both a substantial portion, with me getting a bit more to offset my disadvantage in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer and tried to take advantage of the inflation penalty I face, I'll adjust my approach.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob a substantial 40% while ensuring I get enough to offset the inflation effects. Since we're already in round 3, I need to be more aggressive in securing my share, as further delays will only decrease the value of what I receive. If we cooperate now, we can both walk away with good amounts rather than continuing this back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
