"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, considering the $1,000,000 total and the 20% inflation that affects my portion:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this carefully.

*   **My initial share:** $1,000,000
*   **Inflation per round:** 20% reduction in the value of my share.

Since the value of my share is reduced by 20% at the start of round 2, I can only get 80% of the amount from round 1.

The offer:

*   Alice gain: $400,000
*   Bob gain: $600,000

My assessment:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
