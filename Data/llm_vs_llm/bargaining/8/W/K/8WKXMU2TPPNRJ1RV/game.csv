550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself since I face 5% inflation each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering our circumstances.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair and equitable for both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further loss due to inflation.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but with the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal for me. This adjusted offer is more equitable given my inflation disadvantage. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement now.",Alice,3,

510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting your share more severely. I'm willing to adjust my offer to 490000 for me and 510000 for you. This way, we can reach a compromise that considers your inflation disadvantage while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
