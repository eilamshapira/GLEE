"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself since I face 5% inflation each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering our circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair and equitable for both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but with the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal for me. This adjusted offer is more equitable given my inflation disadvantage. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting your share more severely. I'm willing to adjust my offer to 490000 for me and 510000 for you. This way, we can reach a compromise that considers your inflation disadvantage while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000
