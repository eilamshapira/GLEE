"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself since I face 5% inflation each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering our circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair and equitable for both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further loss due to inflation.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but with the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal for me. This adjusted offer is more equitable given my inflation disadvantage. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 490000,
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting your share more severely. I'm willing to adjust my offer to 490,000 for me and 510,000 for you. This way, we can reach a compromise that considers your inflation disadvantage while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game.""
