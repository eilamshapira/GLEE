"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the $100. This gives us both an equal share, which is the most equitable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 47, ""bob_gain"": 53}

Since we're now in round 3, I need to account for the increasing inflation. If we delay further, the total value will continue to decrease for both of us, but it's affecting me more quickly (10% per round) than it's affecting Bob (5% per round). I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob while still ensuring I receive a fair portion."
