"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we should start with an equal split. While inflation affects me more over time, this is only round 2 and the effect is still minimal. This is fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
