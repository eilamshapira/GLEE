"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I get a bit more to account for inflation affecting you more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 
Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60, citing inflation as a reason for the uneven split.

While it's true that inflation affects me (5% per round) and not her, this first round has no inflation impact yet. The $40 is still worth $40 right now.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, though my $40 would then be worth $38 due to 5% inflation. But I could propose a more favorable split.

Given this is just the first round and I'm not under much inflation pressure yet, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, acknowledging the inflation factor but starting from a more equal position.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think we should start with an equal split. While inflation affects me more over time, this is only round 2 and the effect is still minimal. This is fair for both of us.""}"
