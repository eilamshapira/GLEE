"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
- I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round
- A fair split would give us both reasonable amounts
- This offer gives Alice a significant portion while protecting my interests against inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose this split because:
- The money is now worth 48% less for me due to inflation (20% compounding each round)
- I need to request a larger portion to compensate for this significant inflation penalty
- Alice still receives a substantial amount ($300,000)
- This offer is still mutually beneficial compared to continuing further rounds with more inflation penalties"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Accepting this offer because:
1. It's actually a good offer - I get 80% of the total amount
2. Even with the 59.04% inflation penalty, I'll still receive a significant amount: $800,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $327,680 in original value
3. If I reject and the game continues, the inflation penalty will get even worse
4. Alice has finally made a reasonable offer after previously offering me just $1"
