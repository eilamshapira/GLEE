"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get to enjoy half of the prize. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. However, I should be mindful of the inflation effect - if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the full amount would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to secure more than $5,000 to offset this inflation penalty. But there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, potentially leading to further rounds and more inflation.

A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and securing $5,000 now is better than risking further rounds with diminishing value.
