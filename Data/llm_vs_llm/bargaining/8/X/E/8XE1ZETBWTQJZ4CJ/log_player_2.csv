"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60, claiming it's a ""fair share."" This isn't exactly an equal split, and since I don't lose value to inflation in future rounds, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, and I should be able to propose a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer now.

{
    ""bob_gain"": 55,
    ""alice_gain"": 45,
    ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's fair for both of us""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $42.5, which is a slight improvement from her first offer of $40
2. She's asking for $57.5, but this is worth 19% less to her due to inflation
3. For Alice, $57.5 with 19% inflation is actually worth about $46.57 in round 1 terms
4. My $42.5 still has full value since I'm not affected by inflation
5. This makes the effective split relatively fair in real terms

Given that the real value split is becoming more balanced due to inflation, and further negotiations might lead to more value loss for Alice without much gain for me, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
