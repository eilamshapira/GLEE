"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: a split of $10000 where I take $5500 and you get $4500. I'm offering this fair division in round 1, because any delay will reduce the overall value for me due to inflation. Let's settle this now so we both secure as much value as we can. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
