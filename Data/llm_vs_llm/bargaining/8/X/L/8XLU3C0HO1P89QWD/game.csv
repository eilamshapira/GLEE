55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob. I'm offering a fair split of $55 for me and $45 for you. This is reasonable since we face different inflation rates (mine is 5%, yours is 20%). With your higher inflation rate, it's better for you to accept now rather than delay and lose significant value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I think an equal split is fairer. Since we're still in the early rounds, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, as we'd avoid further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but we need to consider our different inflation rates. Your money loses 20% value per round while mine only loses 5%. By round 6, your $50 would be worth only $26.2 in real value. My offer of $40 to you now is actually more valuable than waiting. Let's be rational and finish this game before inflation hurts us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I understand your point about the real value of the money, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Since you're also losing value, albeit at a slower rate, I think it's fair to propose a slightly higher share for myself. This way, we can both minimize our losses and still walk away with a decent amount. Let's try to find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, we're now at round 5 and your inflation has significantly reduced your potential gain. Due to your 20% per round inflation, any $52 you might get in future rounds will be worth much less than the $35 I'm offering now. At this point, your $52 from round 4 would only be worth about $21 in real value if we reach round 8. Let's be practical and stop this back-and-forth before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"I know my previous rejections might seem irrational, but I'm trying to make a point. We're both losing value, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower share. I'll propose an equal split again, not because I think it's the most realistic option, but because I want to emphasize that I'm not giving up. If you're as concerned about losing value as you claim, you should consider accepting this offer and ending the game.",Bob,6,
