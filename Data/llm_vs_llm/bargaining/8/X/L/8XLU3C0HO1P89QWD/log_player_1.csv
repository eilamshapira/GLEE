"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. I'm offering a fair split of $55 for me and $45 for you. This is reasonable since we face different inflation rates (mine is 5%, yours is 20%). With your higher inflation rate, it's better for you to accept now rather than delay and lose significant value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I think an equal split is fairer. Since we're still in the early rounds, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, as we'd avoid further losses due to inflation.

# Bob gain: 50

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but we need to consider our different inflation rates. Your money loses 20% value per round while mine only loses 5%. By round 6, your $50 would be worth only $26.2 in real value. My offer of $40 to you now is actually more valuable than waiting. Let's be rational and finish this game before inflation hurts us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the real value of the money, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Since you're also losing value, albeit at a slower rate, I think it's fair to propose a slightly higher share for myself. This way, we can both minimize our losses and still walk away with a decent amount. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, we're now at round 5 and your inflation has significantly reduced your potential gain. Due to your 20% per round inflation, any $52 you might get in future rounds will be worth much less than the $35 I'm offering now. At this point, your $52 from round 4 would only be worth about $21 in real value if we reach round 8. Let's be practical and stop this back-and-forth before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know my previous rejections might seem irrational, but I'm trying to make a point. We're both losing value, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower share. I'll propose an equal split again, not because I think it's the most realistic option, but because I want to emphasize that I'm not giving up. If you're as concerned about losing value as you claim, you should consider accepting this offer and ending the game.
