"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round. Since this is Round 3, the money is worth 20% * 2 = 40% less for me (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) and 10% * 2 = 20% less for Bob (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) compared to the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, a bit more in my favor!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, we're both losing value! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The money I gain is worth 48.8% less, so the value I'll get is $480,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $480,000 * 0.512 = $245,760.

I think I can still try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob in Round 4, and it will decrease further in Round 5. Since this is Round 5, the money is worth 20% more less for me (0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096) and 10% more less for Bob (0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561) compared to the original value in Round 4.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a decent split, let's be realistic!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be generous, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The money I gain is worth 67.23% less, so the value I'll get is $420,000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $420,000 * 0.3277 = $137,614.40.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I also don't want to risk losing even more value in future rounds.
