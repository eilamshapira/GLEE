"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that inflation would reduce the value of my share by 20% per round, I need to carefully consider the offer. While Alice's offer of 1000 for me and 9000 for herself is quite uneven, I should calculate what I might get in future rounds after accounting for inflation.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 20%. Even if I proposed a more favorable split, there's no guarantee Alice would accept, and we could potentially end up with nothing after 12 rounds.

This is a very low initial offer, but I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement quickly to avoid the inflation penalty that affects my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from 1000 to 2000, which shows some movement in negotiations. However, I need to consider the inflation effect carefully.

Due to 36% inflation from round 1, the 2000 offer is effectively worth only 1280 in round 1 terms for me. If I reject and we continue negotiating, my share will be subject to even more inflation in future rounds.

While the split is still quite uneven, the inflation pressure is significant, and Alice seems to be negotiating strategically knowing that time works against me. I need to weigh the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds against accepting this improved but still unbalanced offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic given the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split that recognizes Alice's advantage in our negotiation. This gives you a significant majority of the money while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. Given the inflation affecting only my share, it would be in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
