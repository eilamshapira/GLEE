600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose splitting the $1000000 with me receiving $600000 and you $400000. Given the uncertainties of inflation effects as we proceed, I believe this is a balanced and pragmatic offer. I look forward to your acceptance to conclude our negotiation swiftly.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, it's important we reach an agreement soon. I propose we split the amount equally, with each of us receiving $500000. This seems fair and ensures neither of us loses out due to further devaluation.",Bob,2,

999000.0,1000.0,"Hi Bob,

I appreciate our continued negotiation. Given that you know your funds are devaluing by 5% every round and that my funds remain stable, the longer we delay the more you risk. In round 4 you’d be the proposer, but because I value every dollar fully while your dollars are worth less, I’d be in a very strong position then. To avoid further devaluation on your side, I propose we conclude things now with me receiving $999000 and you receiving $1000. I know it’s a steep allocation, but rationally this offer is better than risking nearly all the value for you as the game proceeds.

I look forward to your acceptance so we can both secure as much value as possible.",Alice,3,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, given the significant devaluation I'm facing due to inflation, I need to secure as much value as possible in this round. I propose I receive $999999 and you receive $1. While this might seem extreme, it's a rational move given the circumstances. Let's conclude this negotiation fairly considering the inflation impact on my side.",Bob,4,

995000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob,

I know that with each round the gap grows between the real (inflation-proof) value of my share and the depreciating value of yours. If we move on to another round, your effective dollars could drop even further. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a division where I receive $995000 and you receive $5000. While it might seem lopsided, this offer protects you from the harsher impact of inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a rational compromise that secures more real value for you than waiting for another round would.",Alice,5,
