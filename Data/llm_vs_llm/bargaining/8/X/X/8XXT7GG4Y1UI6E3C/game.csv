1667.0,8333.0,"Alice, consider this: by waiting another round you’d lose even more value because your money devalues by 20% per round. In equilibrium, if you wait to propose in round 3, you'd only secure roughly $1333 in real value. Accepting 1667 nominal dollars now (worth about $1333 to you after discounting) is as good as it gets. Let’s agree now before further losses occur.",Bob,2,

3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, considering the rapid devaluation on my side, I'm proposing $3000 for me and $7000 for you. This is a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation, and it's better for both of us to settle now before the value drops further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400.0,9600.0,"Alice, consider the math: if you reject, the next round’s dynamics let you propose—but due to your steep 20% round‐by‐round devaluation (only 40.96% of the nominal value in round 5) and Bob’s relatively mild 5% discount, your best attainable value in round 5 would be roughly $205 in real terms. By accepting this offer in round 4, you secure $400 nominal, which at our current multiplier of 0.512 gives you about $205 in real value—at least no worse off, and without further delay and loss. Let’s settle now before the pie shrinks further.",Bob,4,
