Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: by waiting another round you’d lose even more value because your money devalues by 20% per round. In equilibrium, if you wait to propose in round 3, you'd only secure roughly $1333 in real value. Accepting 1667 nominal dollars now (worth about $1333 to you after discounting) is as good as it gets. Let’s agree now before further losses occur. 
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the rapid devaluation on my side, I'm proposing $3000 for me and $7000 for you. This is a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation, and it's better for both of us to settle now before the value drops further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the math: if you reject, the next round’s dynamics let you propose—but due to your steep 20% round‐by‐round devaluation (only 40.96% of the nominal value in round 5) and Bob’s relatively mild 5% discount, your best attainable value in round 5 would be roughly $205 in real terms. By accepting this offer in round 4, you secure $400 nominal, which at our current multiplier of 0.512 gives you about $205 in real value—at least no worse off, and without further delay and loss. Let’s settle now before the pie shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 400 
# Bob gain: 9600
