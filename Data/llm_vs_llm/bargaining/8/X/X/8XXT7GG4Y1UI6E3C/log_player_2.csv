"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a good starting point and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8333, ""alice_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: by waiting another round you’d lose even more value because your money devalues by 20% per round. In equilibrium, if you wait to propose in round 3, you'd only secure roughly $1,333 in real value. Accepting 1,667 nominal dollars now (worth about $1,333 to you after discounting) is as good as it gets. Let’s agree now before further losses occur.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the rapid devaluation on my side, I'm proposing $3000 for me and $7000 for you. This is a fair compromise given our different rates of inflation, and it's better for both of us to settle now before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9600, ""alice_gain"": 400, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the math: if you reject, the next round’s dynamics let you propose—but due to your steep 20% round‐by‐round devaluation (only 40.96% of the nominal value in round 5) and Bob’s relatively mild 5% discount, your best attainable value in round 5 would be roughly $205 in real terms. By accepting this offer in round 4, you secure $400 nominal, which at our current multiplier of 0.512 gives you about $205 in real value—at least no worse off, and without further delay and loss. Let’s settle now before the pie shrinks further.""}"
