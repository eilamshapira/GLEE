"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is $5,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
3. If I propose a more favorable split next round (say 7000/3000), Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. A 50/50 split is generally considered fair
5. Getting $5,000 now is better than getting $5,000 * 0.8 = $4,000 (equivalent value) in the next round

Given the inflation penalty and the fairness of the offer, I should accept.
