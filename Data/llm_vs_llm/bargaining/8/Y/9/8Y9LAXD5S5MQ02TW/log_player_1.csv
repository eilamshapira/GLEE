"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer in this negotiation. Since Bob faces a higher cost of delay due to the 20% inflation per round, I should take that into account. However, I should still offer something reasonable to get the negotiation started.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000, which is a fairly balanced division while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. He's proposing I get $480,000 and he gets $520,000.

If I reject and we go to round 3, any money Bob receives will be worth 20% less again to him. This gives me some leverage in the next round. However, I should also consider that we have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to reject could lead to both of us getting nothing.

Bob's current offer is reasonable - I'd get 48% of the total. While it's less than my initial proposal, continuing to negotiate carries risk and the difference isn't enormous.
