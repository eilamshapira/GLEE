"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the 20% decrease for me.

In Round 1, the total amount is $1,000,000, and Alice offers me $450,000 while keeping $550,000 for herself. This means I get 45% of the total amount.

Considering the 20% decrease in value for me in each subsequent round, if I reject this offer, the total amount for me would decrease by 20% in the next round. However, since the game's structure implies that the decrease affects the perceived value for me but not the actual actually divided amount, I should focus on maximizing my share based on the proposals made.

Given that this is the first round and I have 11 more rounds to negotiate, accepting an offer that gives me less than half might not be strategic, especially since Alice's share does not decrease in value over rounds. However, the offer of $450,000 is significant, and the risk of losing value over time is real.

For now, I will reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, hoping that Alice will consider offering a more balanced split or that I can negotiate a better share when it's my turn to propose.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the 20% decrease in value for me, I need to balance between offering Alice a reasonable share to encourage acceptance and maximizing my own gain.

The total value for me in Round 2 is 80% of $1,000,000, which is $800,000, due to the 20% decrease. However, the actual amount to be divided is still $1,000,000.

To make a competitive offer and considering the need to find a mutually acceptable division, I will propose a split that is closer to equal but still slightly favors me, given that Alice's value doesn't decrease over rounds.

My offer for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

This offer gives me 52% of the total amount and Alice 48%, hoping it's attractive enough for her to accept, considering the decreasing value for me in subsequent rounds."
