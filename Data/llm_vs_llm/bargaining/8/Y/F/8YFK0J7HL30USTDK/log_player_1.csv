"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This gives me a reasonable advantage while still offering Bob a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't accept this offer since it gives Bob more than half of the money. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm making a more moderate offer than my first one. I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45, which is a fairer split while still giving me a small advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly in Bob's favor, it's close enough to a 50-50 split, and continuing to negotiate might lead to diminishing returns for both of us."
