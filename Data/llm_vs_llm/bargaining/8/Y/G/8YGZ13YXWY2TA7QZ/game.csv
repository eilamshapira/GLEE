550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving you $450000 and keeping $550000. Settling now avoids the risk of inflation reducing our shares in future rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both. What do you think?",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm willing to take the risk of future inflation for a bigger portion.",Bob,2,

455000.0,545000.0,"Hi Bob, with another round the inflation hits me even harder—my share is now worth only 90% of round‐1 dollars. To avoid further loss for both of us (and to secure your larger share), I propose a split where I get $455000 and you get $545000. This improves your offer compared to last round while ensuring we settle before even greater depreciation sets in. Looking forward to your agreement.",Alice,3,
