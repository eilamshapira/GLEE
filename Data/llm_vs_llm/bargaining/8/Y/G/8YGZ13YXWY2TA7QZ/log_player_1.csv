"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 by giving you $450,000 and keeping $550,000. Settling now avoids the risk of inflation reducing our shares in future rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm willing to take the risk of future inflation for a bigger portion. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 455000, ""bob_gain"": 545000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, with another round the inflation hits me even harder—my share is now worth only 90% of round‐1 dollars. To avoid further loss for both of us (and to secure your larger share), I propose a split where I get $455,000 and you get $545,000. This improves your offer compared to last round while ensuring we settle before even greater depreciation sets in. Looking forward to your agreement.""}"
