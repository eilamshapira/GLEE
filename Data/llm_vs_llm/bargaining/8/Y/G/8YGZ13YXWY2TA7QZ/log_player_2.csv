"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving you $450000 and keeping $550000. Settling now avoids the risk of inflation reducing our shares in future rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm willing to take the risk of future inflation for a bigger portion.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with another round the inflation hits me even harder—my share is now worth only 90% of round‐1 dollars. To avoid further loss for both of us (and to secure your larger share), I propose a split where I get $455000 and you get $545000. This improves your offer compared to last round while ensuring we settle before even greater depreciation sets in. Looking forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 545000 
# Alice gain: 455000
