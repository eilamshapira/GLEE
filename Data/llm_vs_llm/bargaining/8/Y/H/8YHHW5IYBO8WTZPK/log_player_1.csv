"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given our roles in this game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth less to him due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable, don't let the money lose more value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here. This split is fair considering the inflation and we both get a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems reasonable, and considering the inflation, the value of his share is decreasing rapidly. If I reject this offer, the value of his share will decrease even further, which might give me an advantage in the next round. However, I also need to consider that I might not get a better offer in the future rounds.
