"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the time pressure I'm under, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's make a deal quickly so we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning (though this won't be sent to Bob): With 20% inflation per round for me, I need to be strategic. While Bob's offer isn't terrible, I'm still in a position to negotiate for a better deal. The 20% inflation penalty means I should try one more time for a better split, but I can't wait too long as my position will worsen with each round."
