"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. With the 10% inflation per round affecting my value, if I reject now, the total value for me drops to $90 in the next round.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and I'll be making the counter-offer next, I think I can propose a better deal for myself. The inflation penalty makes quick resolution valuable, but this first offer is significantly in Alice's favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the time pressure I'm under, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's make a deal quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering I'm facing higher inflation (20%) than you (10%) each round. We should reach an agreement quickly before both our shares lose more value. This is a balanced proposal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice claims she's facing higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), which is new information. From my perspective:

1. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55
2. Due to inflation, this $45 is worth 19% less than in round 1, so it's equivalent to about $36.45 in round 1 value
3. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation for both of us
4. We're now in round 3 of 12 possible rounds

Given the increasing inflation penalties and the fact that Alice has moved from a 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, this is a more reasonable offer. While I could counter again, the diminishing value makes prolonging negotiation potentially harmful to both of us.
