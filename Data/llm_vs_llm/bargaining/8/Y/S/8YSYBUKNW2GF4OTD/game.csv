4750.0,5250.0,"Hi Alice, considering the 5% inflation that has already occurred, we should both aim to close this deal quickly. I'm proposing a fair split where I get $5250 and you get $4750. This way we both get a good portion without risking further depreciation. It's actually better for you than what you'd get if we keep negotiating and lose another 5%.",Bob,2,
