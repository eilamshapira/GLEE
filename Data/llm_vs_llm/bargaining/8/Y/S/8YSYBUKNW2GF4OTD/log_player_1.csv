Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 5% inflation that has already occurred, we should both aim to close this deal quickly. I'm proposing a fair split where I get $5250 and you get $4750. This way we both get a good portion without risking further depreciation. It's actually better for you than what you'd get if we keep negotiating and lose another 5%. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
