"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me getting $5500 and you getting $4500. It's a fair split considering I'm making the first offer. Let's grab this deal before inflation kicks in! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000
2. She's taking $5500, which is 55% of the total
3. If I reject, we'll lose 5% to inflation (making the total $9,500)
4. But I would get to make the next offer
5. Even with the 5% inflation, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round

While the offer isn't terrible, I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for inflation. A 55-45 split in Alice's favor seems a bit too generous to her position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the 5% inflation that has already occurred, we should both aim to close this deal quickly. I'm proposing a fair split where I get $5250 and you get $4750. This way we both get a good portion without risking further depreciation. It's actually better for you than what you'd get if we keep negotiating and lose another 5%.""}

My reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor
2. This is reasonable since Alice's initial offer was more skewed
3. The total amount is already worth less due to 5% inflation
4. My message emphasizes the urgency to close the deal due to inflation
5. The offer is not too aggressive and leaves room for acceptance"
