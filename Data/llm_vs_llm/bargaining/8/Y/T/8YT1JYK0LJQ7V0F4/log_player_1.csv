"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that I'm affected by 20% inflation per round. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will already be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money: $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties' interests."
