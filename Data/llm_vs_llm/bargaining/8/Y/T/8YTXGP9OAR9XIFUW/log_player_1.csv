"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars. Let's not let inflation eat into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a good offer, especially considering inflation. While I could try for more, there's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds, and we risk losing more to inflation.  A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both benefit."
