"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. While 60/40 isn't quite equal, it's not terrible
3. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 10% to $900,000
4. However, I could propose a more equal split in the next round

I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating, and we still have plenty of rounds left before the deadline.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging her initial reasonable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars. Let's not let inflation eat into our gains.""}"
