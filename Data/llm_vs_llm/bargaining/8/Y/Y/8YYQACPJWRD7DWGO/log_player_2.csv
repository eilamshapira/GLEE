"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair in absolute terms. However, with 20% inflation affecting me each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced to 8,000$.

If I counter-offer in the next round and ask for more than 5,000$, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me. Given the inflation pressure on my side, a fair 50-50 split in the first round is actually advantageous for me.
