"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will reduce my gains due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to offer Bob a substantial portion while keeping slightly more for myself since I know I face 5% inflation per round if this gets rejected. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant share while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $475,000 at 95% value = $451,250 effective value
2. If I reject, next round I can make a new offer, but my gains will be worth 90% of original value
3. The difference between Bob's and my offer isn't huge, and waiting another round will cost me more in inflation
4. This is actually a reasonable counter-offer from Bob

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is fair enough considering the inflation penalty I face, and continuing to negotiate would only reduce the real value of my potential gains. Better to secure a good deal now than risk further depreciation."
