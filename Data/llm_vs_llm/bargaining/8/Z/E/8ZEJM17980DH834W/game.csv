5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined outcome.",Alice,1,

5100.0,4900.0,"Alice, I know that each additional round hurts both of us, especially with your steeper 20% inflation hit. To help us preserve as much value as possible, I'm proposing a near-even split adjusted for that difference â€“ $4900 for me and $5100 for you. Let's accept this deal now instead of losing more value in future rounds.",Bob,2,
