"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined outcome.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that each additional round hurts both of us, especially with your steeper 20% inflation hit. To help us preserve as much value as possible, I'm proposing a near-even split adjusted for that difference â€“ $4900 for me and $5100 for you. Let's accept this deal now instead of losing more value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting this offer is better than continuing to round 3, where I'd make another offer but with 20% more inflation for me and 10% more for Bob.

Bob's current offer gives me $5100, which is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1, so effectively worth $4080 in round 1 value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, the money will be worth another 20% less to me (total 40% less than round 1). Even if I proposed a more favorable split, the inflation would significantly reduce its value.

This is actually a fair offer given our different inflation rates. Bob has adjusted for the fact that I face higher inflation, and continuing would harm both of us but me more significantly.
