"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that each additional round hurts both of us, especially with your steeper 20% inflation hit. To help us preserve as much value as possible, I'm proposing a near-even split adjusted for that difference â€“ $4900 for me and $5100 for you. Let's accept this deal now instead of losing more value in future rounds.""}"
