"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's see.

*   **Alice's offer:** Split it evenly, meaning $50 for me and $50 for Alice.
*   **My gain:** $50 in round 1.
*   **Alice's gain:** $50 in round 1.
*   **Inflation:** Money is worth 5% less for me each round, and 10% less for Alice.

If I reject, the money will be worth less in the next round. Is $50 now better than what I can get in the next round, considering inflation and my negotiating power? Let's assume that I can negotiate with her to a split where I take $60 and she takes $40 in the next round. $60 with 5% inflation means $57. Alice will probably accept $40 since she has an inflation of 10%, meaning that she will receive $36 if we accept the deal now.

Right now, the fairest and smartest decision is to accept the deal.
