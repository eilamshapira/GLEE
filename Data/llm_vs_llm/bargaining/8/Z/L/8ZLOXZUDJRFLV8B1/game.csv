60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering that inflation will affect me more heavily than you in future rounds.",Alice,1,

17.0,83.0,"Alice, I know you’re sensitive to the steep 20% devaluation each round. In round 3 you’d have even less effective value, so I’m offering you 17 dollars out of 100 now – a deal that reflects our discounted positions. I believe this is the best we can do given the cost of delay. Accept this offer and let’s avoid further losses!",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I'm lowering my request to 55-45 to account for inflation effects. This is a reasonable split given our different inflation rates, and continuing further will hurt both of us. Let's conclude this now with a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
23.0,77.0,"Alice, in round 4 the discounting is getting tougher: every dollar I receive is now worth about 0.857 of its face value and yours only 0.512. If you wait until round 5, you'll be able to propose a deal, but your effective value would drop dramatically—to roughly what $23 nominally gives you now. That’s why I’m offering you 23 dollars (while I take 77), ensuring you get about $11.78 in effective value. I believe this deal is better than the losses waiting further would bring. Let's settle now and avoid any more devaluation!",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's end this with a 50-50 split. At this point, my share is heavily devalued by inflation, and further rounds will hurt us both significantly. This is a fair final offer that gives us both reasonable value considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
17.0,83.0,"Alice, at this stage time is costing us dearly. In round 6, every dollar for me is worth about 0.7738 of its face value and for you about 0.3277. If you reject and wait for round 7, as proposer you’d be forced to offer me almost all of the pie in nominal terms in order to meet my future expectations—leaving you with just about 20 dollars nominally (worth roughly $5.46 when adjusted) compared to the $5.57 you’d secure by accepting now. To avoid further loss, I’m proposing an 83–17 split. I believe this is the best deal we can both get given the inflation penalty waiting any longer would cause. Please accept this offer.",Bob,6,
