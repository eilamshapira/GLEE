Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re sensitive to the steep 20% devaluation each round. In round 3 you’d have even less effective value, so I’m offering you 17 dollars out of 100 now – a deal that reflects our discounted positions. I believe this is the best we can do given the cost of delay. Accept this offer and let’s avoid further losses! 
# Alice gain: 17 
# Bob gain: 83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $17 is far too low, even considering inflation. In the next round, my $17 would be worth only $13.6 due to 20% inflation, but I can still make a better counter-offer. Even though I'm more affected by inflation, accepting such a low amount isn't optimal."

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm lowering my request to 55-45 to account for inflation effects. This is a reasonable split given our different inflation rates, and continuing further will hurt both of us. Let's conclude this now with a fair deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 4 the discounting is getting tougher: every dollar I receive is now worth about 0.857 of its face value and yours only 0.512. If you wait until round 5, you'll be able to propose a deal, but your effective value would drop dramatically—to roughly what $23 nominally gives you now. That’s why I’m offering you 23 dollars (while I take 77), ensuring you get about $11.78 in effective value. I believe this deal is better than the losses waiting further would bring. Let's settle now and avoid any more devaluation! 
# Alice gain: 23 
# Bob gain: 77 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the significant inflation impact, $23 is still too low. While my effective value would be only about $11.78 due to the 48.8% inflation, Bob's higher share of $77 is still worth about $66 to him after his 14.26% inflation. I can still make one more proposal that could be better for both of us, even though the inflation pressure is getting severe."

""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this with a 50-50 split. At this point, my share is heavily devalued by inflation, and further rounds will hurt us both significantly. This is a fair final offer that gives us both reasonable value considering our different inflation rates.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, at this stage time is costing us dearly. In round 6, every dollar for me is worth about 0.7738 of its face value and for you about 0.3277. If you reject and wait for round 7, as proposer you’d be forced to offer me almost all of the pie in nominal terms in order to meet my future expectations—leaving you with just about 20 dollars nominally (worth roughly $5.46 when adjusted) compared to the $5.57 you’d secure by accepting now. To avoid further loss, I’m proposing an 83–17 split. I believe this is the best deal we can both get given the inflation penalty waiting any longer would cause. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 17 
# Bob gain: 83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. With the severe 67.23% inflation affecting my share, further negotiations would be counterproductive. While $17 is a small nominal amount, waiting another round would likely result in an even worse effective value due to the compounding inflation effect on my share. Bob's inflation rate is much lower, giving him stronger negotiating power at this stage."
