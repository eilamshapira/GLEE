"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $50 in this round is worth 80% of the original value. I will analyze my options. I have 11 rounds left and the money is worth less each round. Bob's offer is a fair split, even if my share is worth less now. Rejecting could lead to a worse offer in the future.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
