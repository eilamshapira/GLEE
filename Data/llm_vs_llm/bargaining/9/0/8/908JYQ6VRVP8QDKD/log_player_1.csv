I am choosing to accept Bob's previous offer in principle, but presenting it as my own in this round.  There are a few important factors in this decision:

* **Inflation:**  My potential gains are decreasing faster than Bob's. Delaying further hurts my position.
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know how much Bob values the money in future rounds. He might be more resistant to accepting offers as time goes on.
* **Fairness:** While I could try for a slightly better split, 55/45 is already in the realm of reasonably fair divisions. Pushing for more risks losing a decent deal. 

By offering this now, I signal a willingness to compromise and increase the chances of Bob accepting before inflation erodes the value further."
