"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so the total amount I consider is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make a fair offer, considering the reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's gain is $45 * 0.81 = $36.45. 

Given Alice's offer, I think it's a good deal, especially since the value of money is decreasing.
