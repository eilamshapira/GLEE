# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given that we both have an equal say in this. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, round 3. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Remembering the inflation, I need to account for the 20% loss I already incurred.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm at 55/45. I'm feeling the inflation pinch, and this is getting tight for me. Can we agree on this?""
