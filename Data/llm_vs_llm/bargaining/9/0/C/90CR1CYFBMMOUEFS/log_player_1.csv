"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this division as a fair starting point, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover, while still giving Bob a substantial portion that would be hard to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept this offer:
* I would get $4500, but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $4275
* Bob would get $5500 at full value

If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 5% less.

Since we have many rounds left and Bob's first counter-offer is quite aggressive (taking more than half), I think I should reject and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my fairly balanced first offer and countered with an aggressive one, but considering my money loses value each round, I'll propose a deal that's still favorable to me but more attractive to Bob than my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing this 50-50 split because:
1. My share is already worth less due to two rounds of inflation
2. We need to reach agreement soon to avoid further depreciation of my share
3. An equal split is psychologically appealing and fair
4. Bob might be more likely to accept this balanced offer"
