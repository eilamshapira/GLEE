"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but favorable offer, considering I need to account for potential inflation if this goes multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a substantial $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point that gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfavorable, especially considering that my $2,000 would be worth only $1,600 due to the 20% inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, though I need to be mindful that each round makes the money worth less for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 3, I need to account for that my portion will be worth 40% less than the original value. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests against inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering Bob $3,000 while keeping $7,000 for myself. Due to the 40% inflation on my portion, my $7,000 would actually be worth $4,200 to me, which is more reasonable. This offer gives Bob a significant amount while compensating for my inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 48.8% inflation, I would receive $5,120 in effective value (10000 * 0.512), which is better than most realistic alternatives if we continue negotiating. Bob is surprisingly giving up all the money - this is the best possible outcome for me at this point."
