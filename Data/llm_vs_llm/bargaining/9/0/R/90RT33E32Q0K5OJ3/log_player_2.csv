"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. 

If I reject and we move to the next round, I can make my own offer, but the total pot will effectively be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would be worth only $95 to me in the next round. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice might still reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that I'm getting a reasonable portion ($40) and avoiding the guaranteed 5% inflation loss, I think I should accept this offer.
