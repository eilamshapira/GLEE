"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4000 and herself $6000. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty if I reject and move to the next round.

If I reject, the total value would decrease to $9,500 for me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, the maximum I could get would be less than $9,500, so my potential gain would be below $4,750.

Given that $4,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more but risking Alice rejecting my counter-offer (which would lead to further inflation), I should accept this offer.
