"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both face inflation, and you'll get a substantial amount right now instead of risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both get a fair share considering the inflation that's affecting us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $500,000 Ã— 0.95 = $475,000 in effective value
- If I reject and we go to next round:
  * The money will be worth even less (another 5% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
  * I could propose again, but Bob might reject again
  * Time is working against both of us, but more against Bob

While a 50-50 split is less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive than risking another round. The difference between my initial proposal and this one isn't worth the guaranteed loss from inflation.
