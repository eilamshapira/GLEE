"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50/50 split of the $1,000,000.

Given the information:
- Alice offers me $500,000
- The money doesn't lose value for me over time (0% inflation)
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice

This is a fair split, but since inflation doesn't affect me, I could potentially make a counter-offer in the next round that might be more favorable to me. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer if I'm too greedy, and we could end up in multiple rounds of negotiation.

Since $500,000 is a substantial amount and represents a fair division, I'll accept this offer.
