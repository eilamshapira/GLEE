"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and Bob has the option to counter.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close enough to equal that Bob might accept it rather than risk the 5% inflation penalty in the next round, while still giving me a small advantage."
