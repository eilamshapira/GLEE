My proposal: Alice gets $950,000 and Bob gets $50,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's consider the inflation. Bob's money is now worth 10% less than in round 1 (5% per round). My money is worth the same.

To make this attractive to Bob and secure a deal, I'll adjust my offer slightly, taking into account the diminishing value for him.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This should be more appealing than my initial offer given the inflation affecting Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. Bob's money is worth 14.26% less than in round 1, and he's offering me $572,500. I need to decide if this is better than risking another round with further inflation for Bob and potentially a worse offer.

While $572,500 isn't ideal, the longer this goes on, the less Bob's share is worth, and the more desperate he might become. However, there's no guarantee his next offer will be better. It's also worth noting that *my* money isn't being affected by inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
