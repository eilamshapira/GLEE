"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is suggesting that I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000 of the $1,000,000 total.

Since inflation affects Alice (5% per round) but not me (0%), I have an advantage in waiting for later rounds. If I reject now, I can make my own offer in round 2, and if we go further, Alice's effective value decreases while mine stays the same.

This first offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible, but I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges the inflation factor that affects Alice. Since her money loses 5% value each round, I can offer her slightly less than I would take, knowing that an early resolution benefits her.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I propose this division because it gives me a majority of the money while still being fair to Alice, considering that delaying would hurt her more than me due to inflation. This is a reasonable split that gives her incentive to accept rather than continue to later rounds where her portion would effectively be worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reconsider the situation. Alice rejected my offer and is now offering me $480,000 while she takes $520,000.

Let me analyze this:
- We're now in round 3
- Alice's money is worth 9.75% less due to inflation
- My money doesn't lose value
- Alice has increased her offer to me from $450,000 to $480,000

If I reject, we go to round 4, where I make another offer, but Alice's money would be worth even less (about 14.75% less than the initial value). This gives me increasing leverage.

However, this is a fairly reasonable offer giving me 48% of the total. Continuing to negotiate carries some risk as we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.

Still, given my inflation advantage, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making another offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of a 52/48 split and only slightly improved her offer to me in round 3, I'll make a stronger offer but still keep it reasonable given the inflation pressures she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000}

I'm proposing this split because Alice is now facing nearly 15% inflation on her portion if we move to round 5. The time pressure is increasing for her with each round, and this offer gives her a substantial amount while recognizing my advantageous position in the negotiation. This is still a fair offer that should incentivize her to accept rather than face further devaluation of her potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider the evolving situation:

- We're now in round 5
- Alice has slightly improved her offer to me from $480,000 to $490,000
- Alice's money is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round
- My money maintains its full value
- We have 7 more rounds remaining

Alice's inflation disadvantage continues to grow, yet her concessions are relatively small (only +$10,000 from her previous offer). At this point, with her facing significant inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

The inflation pressure on Alice will increase further in the next rounds, so I'll reject this offer and make a stronger counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has been making small concessions while facing increasing inflation pressure, I'll make an offer that reflects my stronger negotiating position while still being reasonable enough that she might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 560000, ""alice_gain"": 440000}

I'm proposing this split because:
1. Alice is now facing over 20% inflation on her portion if we move to round 7
2. We've already used half of our available rounds
3. My previous offers have been rejected, suggesting I need to take a firmer stance
4. This still leaves Alice with a substantial amount ($440,000)

The increasing time pressure and inflation impact should make this a more compelling offer for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation of her potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reassess the situation:

- We're now in round 7
- Alice has improved her offer to a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
- Alice's money is now worth 26.49% less than in the first round
- We have 5 more rounds remaining
- Alice has continued to make small concessions (now +$10,000 from her previous offer)

While Alice is offering an even split, which appears fair on the surface, the inflation factor means this is actually advantageous for me. Her $500,000 is effectively worth only about $367,550 to her (due to the 26.49% inflation), while my $500,000 maintains full value.

However, we're now more than halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing increases. A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and considering the inflation factor, it's actually quite favorable to me.

I'll accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation.
