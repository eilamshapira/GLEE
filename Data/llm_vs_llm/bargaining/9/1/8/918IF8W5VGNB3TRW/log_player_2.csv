"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's ensure we both get our fair share before inflation eats away at my value. I propose a 50-50 split of $10000 right away. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, my next offer will be worth 10% less due to inflation
3. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
4. Even if I could get more in the next round, the 10% inflation penalty would likely make it less profitable
5. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower value in subsequent rounds
