"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

My reasoning is that this is a slightly favorable offer for me, but still fair enough that Bob should accept it to avoid further risk of loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be more generous, but still get a decent share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
