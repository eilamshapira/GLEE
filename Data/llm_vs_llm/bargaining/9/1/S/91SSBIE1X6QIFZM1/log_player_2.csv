"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with equal division. This way we both get a good amount and can finish the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 5% inflation rate per round, if I accept now, I get $50. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 5% less. 

For example, even if I proposed a more favorable split like 60-40 in the next round and Alice accepted, I would get $60 but it would be worth $57 due to inflation.

Given that:
1. The offer is fair (50-50)
2. Inflation will reduce my gains in future rounds
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer
4. We risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
