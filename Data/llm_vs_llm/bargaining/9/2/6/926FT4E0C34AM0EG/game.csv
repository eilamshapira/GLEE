570000.0,430000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where you get $430000 right now. This is a fair offer considering I'll lose 20% value each round, so I need to protect against that risk. If we keep negotiating, we both risk getting less due to inflation on my side.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Considering inflation affects us both, this is the fairest way to ensure we both walk away with something.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer of an equal split, but since inflation affects me by 20% each round (and I'm already down to 80% value), I need to account for that disadvantage. At this point, a $600k/$400k split is actually more equitable in real value. If we continue negotiating, my purchasing power will continue to decrease, making us both worse off.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think we should still aim for a more balanced split. My offer is $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's fairer considering the impact of inflation on both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I think there's a misunderstanding. The inflation isn't affecting us both equally - it only affects my purchasing power, which is now at just 59% of the original value after 4 rounds. To reach a fair agreement, I need to offset this significant disadvantage. My offer of $650k for me and $350k for you accounts for this imbalance. If we continue, the total value we can divide will effectively shrink further for me, making us both worse off.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more. However, I also need to consider my own position. Let's meet in the middle with a $600000/$400000 split. This way, we both make a compromise, and we can end the game with a reasonable outcome for both of us.",Bob,6,
