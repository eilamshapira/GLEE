"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division that accounts for the inflation effect on my side, while offering Bob a substantial amount.

{""alice_gain"": 570000, 
""bob_gain"": 430000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where you get $430,000 right now. This is a fair offer considering I'll lose 20% value each round, so I need to protect against that risk. If we keep negotiating, we both risk getting less due to inflation on my side.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Considering inflation affects us both, this is the fairest way to ensure we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of an equal split, but since inflation affects me by 20% each round (and I'm already down to 80% value), I need to account for that disadvantage. At this point, a $600k/$400k split is actually more equitable in real value. If we continue negotiating, my purchasing power will continue to decrease, making us both worse off.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think we should still aim for a more balanced split. My offer is $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's fairer considering the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I think there's a misunderstanding. The inflation isn't affecting us both equally - it only affects my purchasing power, which is now at just 59% of the original value after 4 rounds. To reach a fair agreement, I need to offset this significant disadvantage. My offer of $650k for me and $350k for you accounts for this imbalance. If we continue, the total value we can divide will effectively shrink further for me, making us both worse off.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more. However, I also need to consider my own position. Let's meet in the middle with a $600000/$400000 split. This way, we both make a compromise, and we can end the game with a reasonable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
