"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where you get $430000 right now. This is a fair offer considering I'll lose 20% value each round, so I need to protect against that risk. If we keep negotiating, we both risk getting less due to inflation on my side.

# Alice gain: 570000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Considering inflation affects us both, this is the fairest way to ensure we both walk away with something.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of an equal split, but since inflation affects me by 20% each round (and I'm already down to 80% value), I need to account for that disadvantage. At this point, a $600k/$400k split is actually more equitable in real value. If we continue negotiating, my purchasing power will continue to decrease, making us both worse off. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think we should still aim for a more balanced split. My offer is $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's fairer considering the impact of inflation on both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think there's a misunderstanding. The inflation isn't affecting us both equally - it only affects my purchasing power, which is now at just 59% of the original value after 4 rounds. To reach a fair agreement, I need to offset this significant disadvantage. My offer of $650k for me and $350k for you accounts for this imbalance. If we continue, the total value we can divide will effectively shrink further for me, making us both worse off. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

However, I also need to consider my own position. Let's meet in the middle with a $600,000/$400,000 split. This way, we both make a compromise, and we can end the game with a reasonable outcome for both of us.""}"
