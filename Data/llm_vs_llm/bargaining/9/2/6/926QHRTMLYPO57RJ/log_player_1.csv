"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more to account for potential future inflation. Let's finish this quickly and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I want us to settle quickly before inflation erodes more of my share. Iâ€™m offering you $565000 and taking $435000 for myself now. This deal rescues us from further losses and benefits us both. I hope you agree to close the game promptly. 
# Alice gain: 565000 
# Bob gain: 435000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $565,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $536,750 to me
2. This is less than what I proposed in round 1 ($550,000)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but it will be worth even less due to inflation
4. The difference between my initial proposal and this deflated offer is relatively small
5. Continuing the game risks further value loss

Given these factors, I'll accept to avoid more value erosion.
