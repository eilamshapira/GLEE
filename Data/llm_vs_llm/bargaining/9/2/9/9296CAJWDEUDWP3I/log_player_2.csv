"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer seems better than Alice's previous offer, it's important to consider the effect of inflation. Accepting $4800 now is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.  Alice is likely aware of this and trying to secure a deal favorable to her while the value diminishes for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly better deal than what I initially rejected to entice Alice. However,  I need to start increasing my share to combat the impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of my potential gains. While Alice's offer is getting closer to an even split, accepting now would mean losing a large chunk of the potential value due to inflation. I need to push for a more favorable split quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 

**Reasoning:** 

I need to increase my demand to offset the inflation. This offer gives me a larger share and might signal to Alice that I'm serious about not accepting a deal heavily skewed by inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Even though Alice is inching closer to a more even split, the value of that $4950 for me is severely diminished because of the inflation.  It's becoming riskier, but I need to hold out for a better deal while I still have rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and inflation is eating into my potential gains.  This offer is a gamble, as it's a significant jump from my previous offer. However, it reflects the urgency of the situation and the need for a more favorable split considering the inflation working against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4975 
# Alice gain: 5025 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While this is far from ideal, the game dynamics have shifted significantly. The relentless inflation means that waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal for me. Accepting Alice's offer now, even though it's heavily skewed in her favor due to the inflation, is the most logical choice at this point to avoid walking away with nothing."
