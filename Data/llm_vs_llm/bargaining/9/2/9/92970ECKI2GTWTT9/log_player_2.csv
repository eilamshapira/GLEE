"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   * Money is worth 5% less to me
   * Money is worth 20% less to Alice
   * I get to make the proposal

Given that Alice faces a much steeper depreciation (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage in the next round. She would be more pressured to accept a better deal for me, as her share would only be worth $4800 in the next round ($6000 * 0.8).

I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money has depreciated (worth 95% to me and 80% to Alice now), I should propose a split that's better for me but still reasonable for Alice to accept, considering she faces higher depreciation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $4000 now is better than risking another round where her money would be worth even less (only 64% of original value)
2. For me, this is a much better deal than the initial offer
3. It's still a reasonable split that doesn't appear too greedy"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $4500 for me, $5500 for Alice
2. With depreciation:
   * My $4500 is actually worth $4066.25 (90.25% of original value)
   * Alice's $5500 is worth $3520 (64% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth only 85.5% for me
   * Next round money will be worth only 51.2% for Alice
   * I get to make the offer

While this offer is better than her first one, Alice is under much more pressure from depreciation. In the next round, her money would lose another 20% of value, while mine only loses 5%. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making another offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the current depreciation (money is worth 85.5% to me and 51.2% to Alice), I should make a strong offer that Alice will feel pressured to accept due to her severe depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

Reasoning:
1. For Alice, $3000 now (worth $1536 with her 51.2% value) is better than risking another round where her money would only be worth 41% of original value
2. Even with my 85.5% depreciation, I'd get the equivalent of $5985 in original value
3. The severe depreciation pressure on Alice's side makes this a reasonable strategic offer, as she should prefer getting something now rather than risk further rounds"
