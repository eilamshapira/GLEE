"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. I should offer Bob enough to make accepting now attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair split considering I face inflation risk in future rounds while Bob doesn't."
