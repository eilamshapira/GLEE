"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end the game early 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's proposing to give me $4000 out of $10,000, while taking $6000 for herself. This is not an even split, as she would get 60% while I would get 40% of the total amount.

While she mentions wanting to end the game early, there's no real disadvantage to continuing the game for another round. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round. I could propose a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose an equal split, which is fairest to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. We both walk away with an equal share and nobody has an advantage over the other.""}"
