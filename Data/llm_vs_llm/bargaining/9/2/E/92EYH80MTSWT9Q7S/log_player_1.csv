"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers both of our interests, taking into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because while it gives me a slight advantage, it's fair enough that Bob should accept rather than move to the next round where both our potential gains decrease due to inflation."
