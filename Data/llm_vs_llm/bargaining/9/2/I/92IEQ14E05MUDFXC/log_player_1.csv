Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account the 10% inflation (meaning my money is now worth 10% less than it was initially). I'll try to be a little more generous.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Alright Bob, let's try this again. How about a 50/50 split this time? It's getting late in the game, and my money is losing its value! Let me know what you think.""
}
