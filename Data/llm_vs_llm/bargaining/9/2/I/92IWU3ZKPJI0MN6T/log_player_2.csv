"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $10 is too low. Since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this unfair division. Even with the 5% inflation penalty per round, I can still propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering that I'm affected by inflation while Alice isn't. The split is still fair enough that it should be attractive to Alice, as she would still get a substantial portion, and if she rejects, she risks getting a worse deal in future rounds due to my inflation penalty forcing me to ask for more to compensate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

$15 is still too low, even considering the inflation penalty. At the current 9.75% inflation, $15 would only be worth about $13.54 to me. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, even though the inflation will increase to 14.75%. The initial value gap between Alice's two offers ($10 to $15) shows she might be willing to negotiate further upward."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share to 65% because of the growing inflation penalty (now 14.75%). This means my $65 is actually worth only about $55.41 to me, while Alice's $35 maintains its full value. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Alice a significant portion while accounting for my inflation disadvantage. If we continue to later rounds, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for further inflation, so this should encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

$20 with an 18.55% inflation penalty would only be worth about $16.29 to me. While Alice is gradually increasing her offers ($10 -> $15 -> $20), they're still too low considering I'm losing value each round. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation, although I need to be mindful that my bargaining power decreases with each round due to inflation. I'll make a more moderate counter-offer in the next round to try to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split because the inflation has now reached 23.55%. My $70 would actually only be worth about $53.52 to me due to inflation, while Alice's $30 maintains its full value. I've increased my request to account for the growing inflation penalty, but I'm still leaving Alice with a significant amount. We're now halfway through the available rounds, and further delays will only make it harder for me to get a reasonable value due to inflation. This offer balances my need to compensate for inflation while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

$25 with a 26.49% inflation penalty would only be worth about $18.38 to me. While Alice continues to increase her offers gradually ($10 -> $15 -> $20 -> $25), they're still too low. However, I need to be very careful now as we only have 5 rounds left, and my bargaining power is significantly diminished due to the growing inflation (next round will be 31.49% inflation). I'll make a more conservative counter-offer next round to try to reach an agreement, as the risk of getting nothing is becoming more concerning."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm reducing my request to 65% to show willingness to compromise. With the current 31.49% inflation, my $65 would actually only be worth about $44.53 to me, while Alice's $35 maintains its full value. I'm lowering my demand from the previous 70-30 split because we're running out of rounds (only 4 left after this), and the risk of getting nothing is becoming significant. This more moderate offer should signal to Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while still trying to compensate somewhat for my inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's why:
1. $30 with 33.66% inflation is worth about $19.90 to me
2. We only have 3 rounds left after this
3. Alice has shown a pattern of small increases ($10->$15->$20->$25->$30)
4. If I reject, the next round will have 38.66% inflation
5. The risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in the remaining rounds is becoming too high

While this isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing, and the inflation penalty means my bargaining power is significantly reduced at this point."
