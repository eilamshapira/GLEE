"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm suggesting this split because we both face inflation with each round, though yours is less severe (10% vs 20%). This slightly favors me but still gives you a substantial portion. If we can agree quickly, we'll both maximize our gains before inflation erodes the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer considering our inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

Given that we're now in round 3 with ongoing inflation affecting both of us (mine at 10% per round, yours at 20%), it's increasingly important that we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a slightly better deal than my first proposal, and considering the faster rate at which the money loses value for you, I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer considering our continued inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. At this point, we're in round 5, and our continued negotiation is significantly reducing the value for both of us - my money is worth 34.4% less than round 1, while yours is worth 59% less. This equal split recognizes that we both need to reach an agreement quickly before further rounds diminish our gains even more dramatically."
