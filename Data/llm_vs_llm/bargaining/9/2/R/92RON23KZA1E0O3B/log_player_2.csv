"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose to take $600000 for myself and give you $400000. I believe this reflects my initiative in starting the offer. Let’s make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. 

If I reject, we move to the next round where I make a counter offer. However, due to inflation, the money would be worth 20% less to me. So that $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I would need to secure more than $500,000 ($400,000 ÷ 0.8) just to break even with what I can get now, accounting for inflation.

This seems like a somewhat reasonable first offer considering the inflation penalty I face. I'll accept this offer.
