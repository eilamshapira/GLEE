"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. With inflation affecting me each round, it's best we agree early to maximize value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if we can get a better deal next round. I'll propose an unequal offer to Alice to see if she accepts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, but you're still getting a substantial amount. It's better to agree sooner rather than later due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I notice inflation affects me more than you - I lose 10% each round while you only lose 5%. This means delaying hurts me more. My offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I need to compensate for my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is lower than my previous offer, and I still think we can negotiate a better deal for me. Let's see if Alice accepts a slightly more generous offer from my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to account for inflation. This offer gives you a reasonable share while considering my interests.""}

Considering that the value of the money is decreasing, I think it would be wise to accept this deal, Alice. However, the choice is yours, and we can continue negotiating if you wish."
