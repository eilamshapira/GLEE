473685.0,526315.0,"Alice, I know we both want to avoid further losses from delay. To reflect the cost of waiting equally for both of us (with my share discounted by 10% each round and assuming similar sensitivity on your side), I propose that I receive $526315 and you receive $473685. I believe this fair split benefits both of us immediately and avoids the extra discount that future rounds would impose.",Bob,2,
