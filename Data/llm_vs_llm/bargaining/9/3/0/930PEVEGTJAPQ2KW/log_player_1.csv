"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to avoid further losses from delay. To reflect the cost of waiting equally for both of us (with my share discounted by 10% each round and assuming similar sensitivity on your side), I propose that I receive $526315 and you receive $473685. I believe this fair split benefits both of us immediately and avoids the extra discount that future rounds would impose. 
# Alice gain: 473685 
# Bob gain: 526315 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
