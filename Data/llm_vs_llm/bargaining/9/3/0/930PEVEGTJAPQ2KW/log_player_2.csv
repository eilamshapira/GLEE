"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 526315, ""alice_gain"": 473685, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both want to avoid further losses from delay. To reflect the cost of waiting equally for both of us (with my share discounted by 10% each round and assuming similar sensitivity on your side), I propose that I receive $526,315 and you receive $473,685. I believe this fair split benefits both of us immediately and avoids the extra discount that future rounds would impose.""}"
