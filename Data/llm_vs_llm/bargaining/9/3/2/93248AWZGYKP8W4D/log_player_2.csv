Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. I'll be reasonable in later rounds if you don't accept, but remember that the money loses value with each round, so we're both better off reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway from our initial offers. This 55-45 split is fair and reflects our equal bargaining positions. With inflation reducing our gains each round, I hope we can agree now for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
