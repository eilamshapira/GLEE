"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll craft a proposal that acknowledges our equal positions in the negotiation, while accounting for the inflation penalty I face.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I lose 10% of value each round we delay, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to offset this inflation risk. This way we both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you proposed a split favoring yourself last round due to inflation, I'm now proposing a split that favors me slightly to account for my own inflation risk. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
