"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is losing value for me, and I'm taking a risk here, I propose a more favorable split for me this time. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The original amount I would get is $450,000, but due to 10% inflation, its value is now $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm trying to be reasonable. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing. Inflation is killing us both. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 30% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, and 10% less in Round 3), but since the actual decrease is 27.1% I will use that, and the money Bob gains is worth 15% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, and 5% less in Round 3), but since the actual decrease is 14.26% I will use that.

The original amount I would get is $420,000, but due to 27.1% inflation, its value is now $420,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $306,780.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation eating away at the value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 37.41% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, and 10% less, but cumulative, in Round 4), and the money Bob gains is worth 19.48% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, and 5% less, but cumulative, in Round 4,  which is (1 - 0.05)^4 = 0.8145, or 18.55% less, I will use 19.48%).

I'll make a new offer, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and avoiding further inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair at this point!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bigger share to compensate for the devaluation. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The longer we wait, the worse it gets for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

The original amount I would get is $400,000, but due to 40.95% inflation, its value is now $400,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $238,200.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm starting to think that getting something is better than risking getting nothing. However, I still don't like the idea of accepting an offer that's heavily skewed in Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round, but I'm getting increasingly concerned about the inflation eating away at the value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 46.41% less than the original amount, and the money Bob gains is worth 25.89% less than the original amount.

I'll make a new offer, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and avoiding further inflation losses. Since Bob's last offer was $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, we're both losing value with each passing round!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm pushing the offer, but it's still not terrible for you. This is the last chance to secure something. Refuse and we both walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

The original amount I would get is $370,000, but due to 52.17% inflation, its value is now $370,000 * (1 - 0.5217) = $177,367.

At this point, I'm starting to think that accepting an offer, even if it's not ideal, is better than risking getting nothing. The inflation is severely eating away at the value, and I don't want to walk away empty-handed.

I'll accept this offer, as it's better than nothing, and the value will only continue to decrease with each passing round.
