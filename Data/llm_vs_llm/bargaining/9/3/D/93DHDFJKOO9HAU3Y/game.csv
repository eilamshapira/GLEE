4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (5% for me vs 20% for you), I think a more balanced split would be $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This acknowledges that time pressure affects you more than me, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds where your share would lose significant value.",Bob,2,
