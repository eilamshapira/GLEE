"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's make this quick and split it $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. This way, we both get a good deal without losing value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (5% for me vs 20% for you), I think a more balanced split would be $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This acknowledges that time pressure affects you more than me, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds where your share would lose significant value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
