"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make this quick and split it $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, we both get a good deal without losing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this split is fair and reasonable given our relative positions and the inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. However, I should consider our different inflation rates. My inflation rate is 5% per round while Alice's is 20% per round. This means Alice has a stronger incentive to conclude the deal quickly than I do.

Given this asymmetry, I believe I can get a better offer by rejecting this proposal and making my own counter-offer in the next round. The money will only be worth 5% less to me next round, but 20% less to Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given our different inflation rates (5% for me vs 20% for you), I think a more balanced split would be $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This acknowledges that time pressure affects you more than me, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds where your share would lose significant value.""}"
