"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

With 4000$ out of 10,000$, I would get 40% of the total. While this isn't an equal split, it's a reasonable starting offer. However:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. The 5% inflation penalty means my 4000$ would be worth 3800$ in the next round
3. We have many rounds left (11), but each delay reduces the value
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds

Given that I can likely negotiate for a better deal and the inflation penalty isn't too severe for just one round, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice made an uneven first offer. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives both of us a substantial amount and is more equitable than the initial proposal. It's a reasonable middle ground that should be acceptable to Alice, considering that delaying further would reduce the money's value for both of us due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me 4500$ (up from her initial 4000$)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, this 4500$ is actually worth 4061.25$ in original value
3. I now know Alice has a much higher inflation rate (36%), which means her 5500$ is worth significantly less to her than it was in round 1
4. This explains why she's becoming more generous
5. If I reject, my next offer would face even more inflation for both of us

Given that:
- Alice has increased her offer
- I now understand she's under more inflation pressure than I am
- The offer is actually better than her first one even with inflation
- Further delays will hurt both of us, but her more significantly

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise given our different inflation rates.
