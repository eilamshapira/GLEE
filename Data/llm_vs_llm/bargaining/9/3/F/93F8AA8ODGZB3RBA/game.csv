5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a deal for this round: I take $5200 and you get $4800. By agreeing now, we both lock in full value, and I believe it’s in our mutual interest to conclude before inflation reduces my share’s worth. Let me know if you accept this offer so we can finish the division promptly.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a fair split is important. How about we each take $5000? This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round and secure our shares.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, considering that the 5% inflation already reduces the value of the money I receive in this round, I believe we both might benefit from holding out for another round where I can propose a division that better reflects our respective devaluations. I'd like to see if we can improve the outcome, so I'll have to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Hi Bob, in light of round 3 and the further devaluation of my share (now roughly 90% of its original value), I’d like to propose a deal that gives you a slight edge, ensuring you benefit more than in the previous round. I propose that you receive $5100 and I get $4900. This small bonus for you should help counter any inflation effects on your side, while enabling us to close the deal now rather than risk additional losses in value. I hope you find this offer fair and are ready to settle it at this stage.",Alice,3,

4600.0,5400.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact, I propose I take $5400 and you take $4600. This ensures I get a bit more to compensate for the value loss I'm experiencing. Let's settle this round to minimize further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand the heavy impact inflation is having on our shares. While receiving $4600 isn't ideal for me, I'm aware that waiting any longer will only further erode my value. In light of that, I’m willing to accept your offer so we can both lock in our respective shares before the situation worsens. Let's settle it now.",Alice,4,accept
