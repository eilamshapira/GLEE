"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a deal for this round: I take $5200 and you get $4800. By agreeing now, we both lock in full value, and I believe it’s in our mutual interest to conclude before inflation reduces my share’s worth. Let me know if you accept this offer so we can finish the division promptly. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a fair split is important. How about we each take $5000? This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round and secure our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of round 3 and the further devaluation of my share (now roughly 90% of its original value), I’d like to propose a deal that gives you a slight edge, ensuring you benefit more than in the previous round. I propose that you receive $5100 and I get $4900. This small bonus for you should help counter any inflation effects on your side, while enabling us to close the deal now rather than risk additional losses in value. I hope you find this offer fair and are ready to settle it at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900
