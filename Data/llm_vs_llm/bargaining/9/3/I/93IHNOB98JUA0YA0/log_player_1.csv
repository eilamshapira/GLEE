I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, as I am taking a significant majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself.  This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I'm still taking a larger share. I believe this is fair given that I'm the one making the offer this round."
