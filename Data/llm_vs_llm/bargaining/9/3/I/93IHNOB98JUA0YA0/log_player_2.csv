"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which is quite low. Even with 5% inflation per round, I can likely negotiate a better deal in the next round. If I propose something more balanced in round 2, I would still get more than $100,000 even after 5% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice made such an aggressive first offer. I'll also be clear but fair in my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a much more equitable division that gives both parties a substantial amount, while still accounting for the fact that I'm facing inflation pressure in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* Alice is now offering me $400,000
* With 9.75% inflation, this $400,000 is actually worth $361,000 to me
* If I reject and we go to another round:
  * Inflation will increase to 14.75% for me
  * My best case scenario in the next round would likely be similar or worse, as Alice seems to be negotiating strategically
  * Even with a better nominal amount, the increased inflation would likely result in less real value

This is actually a reasonable offer given the circumstances, and the inflation risk of continuing is significant.
