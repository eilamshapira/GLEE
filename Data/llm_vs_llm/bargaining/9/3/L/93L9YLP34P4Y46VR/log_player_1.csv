"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm ready. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is round 2, my money is worth 10% less than in round 1.

My calculation:

*   **Alice's value in Round 1:** 60 (as proposed). In Round 2, the value is 60 - (60 \* 0.10) = 54.

I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
