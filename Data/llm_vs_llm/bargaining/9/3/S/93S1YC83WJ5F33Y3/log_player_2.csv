"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. However, with inflation reducing the value by a percentage each round, this first-round offer is worth the full amount to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and the money will already be worth 20% less to me in the next round.

Since this is a fair split with no inflation penalty, I'll accept.
