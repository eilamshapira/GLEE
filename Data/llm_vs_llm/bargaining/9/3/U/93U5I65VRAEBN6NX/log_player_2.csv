"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40$ out of 100$
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
4. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but I need to consider that Alice has no inflation penalty
5. 40$ is a decent offer, considering the inflation risk

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a reasonable offer. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and my potential gains would already be reduced by 20%.
