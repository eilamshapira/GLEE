"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start, considering I made the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 10% less
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $90
   * But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The offer of $40 is reasonable enough, especially considering the risk of inflation. If I reject and the negotiation extends multiple rounds, we might both end up with less value.
