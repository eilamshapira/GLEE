"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly favorable split for me since I'll be more affected by inflation in future rounds (20% vs your 5%). This way we can both get a good amount without having to play more rounds and lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a split that leans slightly in my favor due to the lower inflation impact on me. However, it's still a reasonable offer given the circumstances. Let's settle this to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
