"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly favorable split for me since I'll be more affected by inflation in future rounds (20% vs your 5%). This way we can both get a good amount without having to play more rounds and lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the impact of inflation on both of us in subsequent rounds.

In the first round, if I accept, I get $45, and if I reject, the value of the money decreases by 5% for me and 20% for Alice.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $45 and her $55, this seems somewhat unfair since I'm only losing 5% value per round, and she's losing 20%. However, considering the game's nature and the fact that we're in the first round, I should think about the potential losses in subsequent rounds.

If I reject this offer, in the next round, the total value of the money would decrease. For me, the $100 would become $95 (due to 5% inflation), and for Alice, it would become $80 (due to 20% inflation). But since the game is about dividing the $100 between us and the value decrease affects what we perceive as fair, I need to think about maximizing my gain.

Given that Alice's first offer already gives her a larger share, and considering the inflation rates, I might be better off negotiating or waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round, hoping that Alice's larger inflation rate will encourage her to make a more favorable offer to me to avoid further losses.

However, since this is the first round and the difference in inflation rates significantly affects Alice more than me, I should also consider the strategic aspect of making Alice feel like she has the upper hand early on might lead to better offers later.

But, looking at the numbers and considering the significant difference in inflation rates, I think I can do better than $45, especially since I'm at an advantage with only a 5% decrease.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice is more affected by the decrease in value, I'll make an offer that's somewhat favorable to me but still reasonable for Alice to consider, given her higher inflation rate.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice with each passing round, I'll take into account that Alice might be more inclined to accept an offer sooner rather than later due to her higher loss rate.

My offer will be:
{""bob_gain"": 52.5, 
""alice_gain"": 47.5, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a split that leans slightly in my favor due to the lower inflation impact on me. However, it's still a reasonable offer given the circumstances. Let's settle this to avoid further devaluation.""}"
