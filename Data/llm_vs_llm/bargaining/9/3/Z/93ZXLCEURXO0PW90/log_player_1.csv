"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and considering the inflation I'm facing, I'd rather not prolong the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's perspective on inflation, I think it's a reasonable offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same, and Bob is willing to split it equally despite the inflation affecting his share, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
