"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money with each round. In the first round, the value is still $1,000,000. I'll aim for a split that is favorable to me, but reasonable enough that Bob will accept, considering the alternative is a significantly smaller amount in later rounds.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a 60/40 split. While it favors me, $400,000 is still a significant amount, and Bob might prefer to take that now rather than risk getting a smaller amount in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and now the total value is effectively $800,000 for the purpose of evaluating future gains. Bob's offer is now for me to receive $450,000 and him $550,000.

I need to consider whether $450,000 now is better than what I might get if I reject and make a counteroffer in round 3. If I reject, the value will decrease by another 20%. I think it's worth trying to get a better deal, as $450,000 is less than half of the original million.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, the value of the potential gains has decreased by 20% again. This means the remaining amount effectively represents $640,000 in original round 1 dollars (80% of $800,000).

I need to make a proposal that Bob will likely accept, or we risk another round of inflation eating into the total value. I will offer him slightly more than before in real dollar terms, although it is now less as a percentage of the total available. Since Bob asked for 550k previously which is 55% of the original amount, and given the inflationary pressure, I think an amount equivalent to 60% of the current value is a good starting point.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000
}
```
This offer gives bob 616000 and myself 384000, which is 61.6% and 38.4% respectively."
