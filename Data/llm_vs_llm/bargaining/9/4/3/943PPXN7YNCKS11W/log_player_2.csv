"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is:
- I get $4,500
- Alice gets $5,500

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me (meaning my $4,500 would become worth $4,275).

While the split isn't perfectly equal, $4,500 is still a substantial amount. Making a counter-offer would cost me $225 in value due to inflation, and Alice might reject my offer anyway, leading to further losses.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonably fair initial offer, I'll accept.
