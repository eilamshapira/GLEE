"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division to ensure we both get a substantial amount while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's a fair split that avoids the risk of further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Though slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount
2. Continuing to negotiate would mean losing 5% more value each round
3. The difference between this offer and my initial proposal isn't worth the risk of further depreciation
4. It's a reasonable and fair counter-offer"
