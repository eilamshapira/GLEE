"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I should make a strong initial offer, considering that each round the money loses 5% value for me but not for Bob. I'll propose a favorable split while leaving enough for Bob to consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair split considering I'm the one facing depreciation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $400,000 Ã— 0.95 = $380,000 in effective value
2. If I reject, next round I can make another offer, but my share will be worth another 5% less
3. This could become a back-and-forth where my effective value keeps decreasing
4. We have 10 more rounds, but each round my position weakens
5. Bob's offer, while not ideal, still gives me a substantial amount

Given the time pressure and the inflation penalty I face, I'll accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate would likely result in diminishing returns for me.
