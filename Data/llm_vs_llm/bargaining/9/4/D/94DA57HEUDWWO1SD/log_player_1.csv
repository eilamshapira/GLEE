"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we both have equal chances of making a good deal. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 5% inflation, getting $45 now is worth about $42.75 to me. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation. The fact that Bob's money is worth 10% less doesn't affect my decision directly - I'm focused on maximizing my own return."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your move toward a more balanced split. I'm now offering a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation affecting both of us, we should reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise from my initial offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting us both, let's split it evenly and ensure we both get a fair share before it's too late. A 50-50 split is the most reasonable option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 14.26% inflation, getting $50 now is worth about $42.87 to me. If I reject and continue negotiating, further inflation will reduce the value even more. Since Bob is moving towards a more reasonable split and the inflation penalty is significant, it's better to accept this fair offer now rather than risk further value deterioration."
