"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll take that into account. The total amount is now worth $950,000 to me (due to 5% inflation).

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""alice_gain"": 525000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $375,000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $339,625 to me (since it's 9.75% less).

I'll think about it... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less to me now, due to another 5% decrease. The total amount is now worth approximately $855,625 to me (after 5% + 5% = 10.25% decrease, then another 5% of the remaining, which is roughly 14.06% total decrease, but I'll use the given 9.75% from previous round + 5% = 14.75% total decrease, so the value is 1,000,000 * 0.8525 = $852,500, but I'll calculate it precisely: 
1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $950,000, 
$950,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $902,500, 
$902,500 * (1 - 0.05) = $857,375).

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 430000, 
""alice_gain"": 570000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money I would gain is worth approximately $281,450 to me (since $350,000 is 18.55% less, so $350,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $283,425, but I'll calculate it precisely: 
1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $950,000, 
$950,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $902,500, 
$902,500 * (1 - 0.05) = $857,375, 
$857,375 * (1 - 0.05) = $814,606.25, 
$350,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $283,725).

Considering this, I think I'll accept the offer.
