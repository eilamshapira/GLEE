"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to keep things simple and fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. It's a fair and equal division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - Money value remains the same for me
   - It's already a reasonable offer

Given these factors, accepting a fair 50-50 split in the first round seems like the rational choice. There's no clear advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer.
