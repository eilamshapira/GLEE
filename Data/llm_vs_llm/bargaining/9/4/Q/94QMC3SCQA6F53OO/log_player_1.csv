"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering inflation, I want to secure as much as possible.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, this offer is definitely worse for me than my original one. However, rejecting will lead to a lower value of money for both of us.
