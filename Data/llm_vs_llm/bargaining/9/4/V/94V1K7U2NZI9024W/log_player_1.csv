"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that respects both our interests while acknowledging the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we divide the money fairly with me getting $5,500 and you getting $4,500. Since I'll be affected by 10% inflation per round if we delay, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself. This is a reasonable split that benefits us both and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12."
