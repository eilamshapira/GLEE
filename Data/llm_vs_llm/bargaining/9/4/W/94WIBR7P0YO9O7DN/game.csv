4737.0,5263.0,"Hi Alice, here's my proposal for Round 2: I suggest we split the $10000 as $5263 for me and $4737 for you. Waiting costs us both due to the 10% discount per round, so accepting now secures you roughly what you'd expect to get later. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you say?",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, further delay will only erode the total value for both of us. With inflation at work, every round costs us dearly. In this round, my offer gives you $4500, which is a solid share given the circumstances. I believe this is a fair proposal that avoids further unnecessary loss. Let's conclude this deal before we lose even more value. What do you say?",Bob,4,
