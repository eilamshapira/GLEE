"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end early""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, here's my proposal for Round 2: I suggest we split the $10000 as $5263 for me and $4737 for you. Waiting costs us both due to the 10% discount per round, so accepting now secures you roughly what you'd expect to get later. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% discount due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round due to inflation, and we're now in Round 3, the total value of the money has decreased by 20% (10% in Round 2 + 10% in Round 1, but applied sequentially it's 1 - 0.9 * 0.9 = 19% decrease, so approximately $8,100 is the value we're dividing, but for simplicity, we'll stick with the $10,000 nominal value and adjust our shares accordingly).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal, inflation is eating away""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delay will only erode the total value for both of us. With inflation at work, every round costs us dearly. In this round, my offer gives you $4500, which is a solid share given the circumstances. I believe this is a fair proposal that avoids further unnecessary loss. Let's conclude this deal before we lose even more value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% less than in Round 1), I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting Bob's offer.
