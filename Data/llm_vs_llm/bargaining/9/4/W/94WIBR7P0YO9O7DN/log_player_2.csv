Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5263, ""alice_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, here's my proposal for Round 2: I suggest we split the $10,000 as $5,263 for me and $4,737 for you. Waiting costs us both due to the 10% discount per round, so accepting now secures you roughly what you'd expect to get later. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal, inflation is eating away 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, further delay will only erode the total value for both of us. With inflation at work, every round costs us dearly. In this round, my offer gives you $4,500, which is a solid share given the circumstances. I believe this is a fair proposal that avoids further unnecessary loss. Let's conclude this deal before we lose even more value. What do you say?""}"
