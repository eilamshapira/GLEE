168765.87,831234.13,"Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1. I suggest splitting the $1000000 so that you get $831234.13 and I keep $168765.87. Given that waiting hurts my share 20% per round while your share only depreciates by 5%, this split reflects the advantages and disadvantages each of us face if we delay. Accepting today avoids any further value loss. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the depreciation rates, I'm offering a split where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This reflects a balance between our positions, taking into account the risk of further depreciation. It's a reasonable offer, given the circumstances. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this.",Bob,2,
