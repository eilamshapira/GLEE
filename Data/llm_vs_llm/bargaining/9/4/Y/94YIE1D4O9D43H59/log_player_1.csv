"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 168765.87, ""bob_gain"": 831234.13, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1. I suggest splitting the $1,000,000 so that you get $831,234.13 and I keep $168,765.87. Given that waiting hurts my share 20% per round while your share only depreciates by 5%, this split reflects the advantages and disadvantages each of us face if we delay. Accepting today avoids any further value loss. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the depreciation rates, I'm offering a split where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This reflects a balance between our positions, taking into account the risk of further depreciation. It's a reasonable offer, given the circumstances. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
