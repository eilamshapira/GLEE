"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1. I suggest splitting the $1000000 so that you get $831234.13 and I keep $168765.87. Given that waiting hurts my share 20% per round while your share only depreciates by 5%, this split reflects the advantages and disadvantages each of us face if we delay. Accepting today avoids any further value loss. I hope you find this offer fair and in our mutual interest. 
# Bob gain: 831234.13 
# Alice gain: 168765.87 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine if the offer is fair, let's analyze the situation. 

In the first round, Alice offers me $831,234.13 and keeps $168,765.87 for herself. 

Given the depreciation rates, if I reject this offer, in the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice. 

However, without calculating the exact future values, we can see that Alice's offer gives her significantly less than half of the total amount, which might seem unfair at first glance, considering the total amount is $1,000,000.

But, considering the depreciation rates and the fact that Alice's share depreciates faster, her offer might actually be reasonable, aiming to balance the present value with the risk of future depreciation.

Still, as Bob, my goal is to maximize my gain. Given that this is the first round and I have 11 more rounds to negotiate, I might want to see if I can get a better offer in the next round, considering the significant depreciation of Alice's potential earnings.

Therefore, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the depreciation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the fact that Alice's share depreciates faster.

Let's calculate the depreciation for both of us for this round:
- My share depreciates by 5%, so the total amount I can offer is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
- Alice's share depreciates by 20%, so the total amount she can consider is $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

However, these calculations are for understanding the depreciation impact. The actual offer should be based on the original $1,000,000 for simplicity and clarity in negotiation.

Given this, I'll make an offer that splits the money in a way that acknowledges Alice's faster depreciation but also ensures I get a significant share.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the depreciation rates, I'm offering a split where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This reflects a balance between our positions, taking into account the risk of further depreciation. It's a reasonable offer, given the circumstances. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this.""}"
