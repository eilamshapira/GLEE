Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation rates, I propose a 48-52 split in your favor, Bob. This way, we both get a fair share considering the diminishing value of money. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 48
