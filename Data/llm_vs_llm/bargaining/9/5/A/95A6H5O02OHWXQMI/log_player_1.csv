"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's fair enough that Bob should accept it, considering that if he rejects, the total amount will decrease by 10% in the next round. A reasonable split now is better than a potentially larger share of a smaller amount later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation, the current total value is $900,000. Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is a fair amount. If I reject and propose in the next round, we'll be dealing with $810,000 total, and even if I propose a better split for myself, Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation.

Given that Bob's offer is quite reasonable (close to 50-50) and considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept.
