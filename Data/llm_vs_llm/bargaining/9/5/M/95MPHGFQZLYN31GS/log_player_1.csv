"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it more even, 55/45 seems reasonable 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 0.9 * $450,000 = $405,000.

Since this is the first offer from Bob, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to make a more appealing offer. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now.

For me, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so in Round 3, I'll effectively get 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so in Round 3, he'll effectively get 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 52/48 is a good compromise""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal before it's too late, 52/48 in my favor 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $480,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get 0.729 * $480,000 = $349,920.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is losing value rapidly, I might need to reconsider my strategy.
