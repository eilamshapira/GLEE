"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. However, for the division, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's make it more even, 55/45 seems reasonable""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, 52/48 is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $480,000 * 0.64 (since it's worth 36% less) = $307,200.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me each round, and this is the 4th round, the actual amount I'm considering is $1,000,000 * (0.8)^3 = $1,000,000 * 0.512 = $512,000. However, for the division, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base.

For Alice, the money is worth 10% less each round, so it's $1,000,000 * (0.9)^3 = $1,000,000 * 0.729 = $729,000.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us.
