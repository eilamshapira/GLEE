"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. This is a $400,000 offer for me, with Alice taking $600,000.
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me.
3. If I accept now, I get $400,000 at full value.
4. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, it will be worth less due to inflation.
5. This is a reasonable first offer - 40% for me, 60% for Alice.

Given the inflation penalty and that this is a fairly reasonable split, I'll accept.
