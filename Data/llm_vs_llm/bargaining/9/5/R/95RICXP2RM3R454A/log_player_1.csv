"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects, the total amount will decrease by 5% in the next round, meaning we'd only be splitting $950,000, which would likely result in both of us getting less than with this current offer."
