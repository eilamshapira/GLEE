650000.0,350000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good deal and avoids excessive losses for both of us due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400000 now is better for you than getting more money in future rounds. If you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. I've adjusted my offer to be more in your favor while still recognizing the impact of inflation on my end. Let's wrap this up.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, consider this carefully: If you reject this offer, your next round's money will be worth almost 50% less than round 1. Your $300000 now is worth more than $500000 in the next round due to your inflation penalty. This is your best economic choice at this point.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, I understand the situation and I'm willing to make a significant compromise to finalize this. This is my final offer. Let's end this now and avoid further losses for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic about the numbers. Your $200000 now is worth more than $450000 in the next round due to the compounding inflation you face. If you reject this, your next round's money will be worth less than 33% of its original value. This offer is your best remaining option - further negotiation will only reduce your real value.",Bob,6,
