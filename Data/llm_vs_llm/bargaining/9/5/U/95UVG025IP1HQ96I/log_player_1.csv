Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400000 now is better for you than getting more money in future rounds. If you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less. Let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

I believe this offer presents a good balance. Here's why:

* **Acknowledges Bob's position:**  The offer is a significant move towards Bob's desired outcome, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Factors in inflation:** While less than my initial offer, it still secures me a reasonable amount considering the declining value over time. 
* **Promotes quick resolution:** Prolonging the negotiation only hurts me due to inflation. This offer incentivizes Bob to accept now."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this carefully: If you reject this offer, your next round's money will be worth almost 50% less than round 1. Your $300000 now is worth more than $500000 in the next round due to your inflation penalty. This is your best economic choice at this point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand the situation and I'm willing to make a significant compromise to finalize this. This is my final offer. Let's end this now and avoid further losses for both of us."" 
}
```

Here's why this is my final offer:

* **Recognizing the time pressure:** While Bob isn't directly affected by the passing rounds, I am.  I need to act decisively to prevent further erosion of my potential gain.
* **Significant concession:** This offer leans heavily in Bob's favor, demonstrating my strong desire to reach a resolution. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm making it clear that I'm at my limit and further negotiation is pointless. This may incentivize Bob to accept."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic about the numbers. Your $200000 now is worth more than $450000 in the next round due to the compounding inflation you face. If you reject this, your next round's money will be worth less than 33% of its original value. This offer is your best remaining option - further negotiation will only reduce your real value. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

While far from ideal, Bob is sadly correct. The longer this drags on, the less I'll get. Accepting this offer cuts my losses."
