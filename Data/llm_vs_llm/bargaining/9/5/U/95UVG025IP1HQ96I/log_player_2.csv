"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good deal and avoids excessive losses for both of us due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer gives me $350,000 and her $650,000
2. This isn't an equal split - she's taking 65% of the money
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - The money won't lose value for me
   - But it will be worth 20% less to Alice
   - This gives me negotiating leverage

Since Alice faces significant inflation penalty and I don't, I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer. The split should be more in my favor given this asymmetric inflation impact.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice faces 20% inflation while I don't:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400,000 now is better for you than getting more money in future rounds. If you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}

Reasoning:
1. This is a more favorable split for me (60/40)
2. For Alice, rejecting would mean her next round's money is worth 20% less
3. My message emphasizes the time pressure she faces
4. It's still a substantial amount for Alice ($400,000) while being fair given the circumstances"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. I've adjusted my offer to be more in your favor while still recognizing the impact of inflation on my end. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $550,000 is actually worth only $352,000 (64% of original value) to her
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - My money will still maintain full value
   - Alice's share will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
   - This gives me even more negotiating leverage

Since Alice's money continues to lose value while mine doesn't, and the current split is still not optimal given my strong position, I should reject and make a better counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has lost significant value and will lose even more if she rejects:

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, consider this carefully: If you reject this offer, your next round's money will be worth almost 50% less than round 1. Your $300,000 now is worth more than $500,000 in the next round due to your inflation penalty. This is your best economic choice at this point.""}

Reasoning:
1. The inflation has severely weakened Alice's position
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will only be worth about 51.2% of original value
3. $300,000 now is actually better for her than a larger amount in the next round
4. My position is strong since I face no inflation
5. The offer is still substantial enough that it should be attractive given her deteriorating position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation and I'm willing to make a significant compromise to finalize this. This is my final offer. Let's end this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this latest offer:

1. Alice is offering me $550,000 (55%) and taking $450,000 (45%)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $450,000 is actually only worth $184,320 to her (40.96% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - My money maintains full value
   - Alice's share will depreciate another 20%
   - Her position will be even weaker

Given that I can get an even better deal next round, and my position continues to strengthen while Alice's weakens significantly, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the severe inflation impact on Alice's value at this point:

{""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic about the numbers. Your $200,000 now is worth more than $450,000 in the next round due to the compounding inflation you face. If you reject this, your next round's money will be worth less than 33% of its original value. This offer is your best remaining option - further negotiation will only reduce your real value.""}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's money has lost nearly 60% of its value already
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will only be worth about 32.8% of original value
3. $200,000 now is actually better for her than $450,000 next round
4. My position is extremely strong as I face no inflation
5. The rapid depreciation of value makes this a rational offer given the circumstances
6. It's still enough money to make acceptance better than further negotiation for Alice"
