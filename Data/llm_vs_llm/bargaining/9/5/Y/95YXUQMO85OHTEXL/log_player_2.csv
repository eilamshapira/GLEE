"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value will be worth 5% less to me
   * $100 becomes worth $95 to me
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
   * We'd risk further rounds of inflation

While the split isn't 50-50, $40 is still a significant amount. If I reject, any potential gain from a better split might be offset by the inflation penalty. The risk of losing more value through multiple rounds of negotiation makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice.
