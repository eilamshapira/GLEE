4201.46,5798.54,"Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose to split the $10000 as $4201.46 for me and $5798.54 for you. Think of it this way: if you were to reject and make the proposal in round 2 under the harsher 10% depreciation you face, your best‐case outcome would be worth about $5800 in today’s dollars. This offer gives you at least that, so it’s in both our interests to settle now and avoid further losses. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,
