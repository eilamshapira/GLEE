"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4201.46, ""bob_gain"": 5798.54, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose to split the $10,000 as $4,201.46 for me and $5,798.54 for you. Think of it this way: if you were to reject and make the proposal in round 2 under the harsher 10% depreciation you face, your best‐case outcome would be worth about $5,800 in today’s dollars. This offer gives you at least that, so it’s in both our interests to settle now and avoid further losses. Let me know what you think!""}"
