"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose to split the $10000 as $4201.46 for me and $5798.54 for you. Think of it this way: if you were to reject and make the proposal in round 2 under the harsher 10% depreciation you face, your best‐case outcome would be worth about $5800 in today’s dollars. This offer gives you at least that, so it’s in both our interests to settle now and avoid further losses. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 5798.54 
# Alice gain: 4201.46 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
