40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 5% inflation per round, this is reasonable - if we delay further, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for my decreasing purchasing power. This offer still gives you a substantial $40, and we can conclude the deal now without further delays.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, a 60-40 split in your favor is too imbalanced. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which acknowledges your inflation issue while still being more balanced for both of us. This way we can conclude this now without further delays, which would only make your inflation situation worse.",Alice,3,
