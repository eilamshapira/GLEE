"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split, where we both get an equal amount. This way both of us benefit equally from the division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 5% inflation per round, this is reasonable - if we delay further, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for my decreasing purchasing power. This offer still gives you a substantial $40, and we can conclude the deal now without further delays. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, a 60-40 split in your favor is too imbalanced. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which acknowledges your inflation issue while still being more balanced for both of us. This way we can conclude this now without further delays, which would only make your inflation situation worse.""}"
