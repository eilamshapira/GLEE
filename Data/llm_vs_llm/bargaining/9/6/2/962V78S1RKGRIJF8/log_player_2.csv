"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split, where we both get an equal amount. This way both of us benefit equally from the division. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. If I waited until round 2 to get $60, it would actually be worth $60 × 0.95 = $57 to me, which is better than $50 now. However, Alice might not accept my counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for inflation while being attractive enough to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 5% inflation per round, this is reasonable - if we delay further, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for my decreasing purchasing power. This offer still gives you a substantial $40, and we can conclude the deal now without further delays.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. However, a 60-40 split in your favor is too imbalanced. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which acknowledges your inflation issue while still being more balanced for both of us. This way we can conclude this now without further delays, which would only make your inflation situation worse. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's offering me $45, but with 9.75% inflation compared to round 1, this $45 is actually worth $45 × 0.9025 = $40.61 to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the inflation will increase to approximately 14.5% (another 5% drop), meaning any amount would be worth even less to me. For example, if I asked for $65 next round and she accepted, it would be worth about $65 × 0.855 = $55.58 to me.

Given that Alice has already rejected my 60-40 split, there's a risk she would reject a higher demand from me, causing further rounds of inflation that would harm my position even more.
