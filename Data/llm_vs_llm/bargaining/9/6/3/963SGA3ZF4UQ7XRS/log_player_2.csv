"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject and go to the next round, I'll face a 10% inflation penalty, meaning the $100 would be worth only $90 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the maximum I could reasonably get would be something like $50-55 (out of the $90 effective value to me), which is still less than $60 in absolute terms.

Given the inflation penalty I face, this initial offer of $40 is actually reasonable. If I reject, I'm effectively working with less total money due to my inflation penalty.
