"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep things fair and simple with a 50/50 split. We both benefit equally this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $5000 but with 5% inflation, so effectively $4750
2. If I reject, next round I can propose again, but I'll face another 5% inflation
3. There's risk in continuing as Bob might propose less favorable terms
4. A 50/50 split is generally considered fair
5. We've already lost one round to inflation, and continuing could make things worse
