Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, considering inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the offer considering the inflation:

450,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 450,000 * 0.4096 = 184,320

Considering inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting this offer might not be great but inflation could make my further gains poor.
