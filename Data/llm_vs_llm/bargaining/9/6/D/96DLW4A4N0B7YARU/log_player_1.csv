"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob. I want to get as much as possible while still ensuring he accepts, considering the inflation in later rounds. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Current Offer:** Bob is offering me $400,000.
*   **Inflation:** The value of the money is now 20% less than in Round 1. This means $400,000 now is equivalent to $400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000 in Round 1 terms.

If I reject this, it goes to Round 3. The money will be worth another 20% less. That means it will be worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. To get the equivalent of $400,000 from Round 1, Bob would need to offer me 400000/0.64=625000. That is unlikely, so I will accept the offer now.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
