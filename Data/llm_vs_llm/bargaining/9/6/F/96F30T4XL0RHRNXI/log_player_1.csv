"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about an even split? This way we both gain equally and can avoid the diminishing value due to inflation if we delay further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering:
1. The 10% inflation penalty means my $50 is now worth $45
2. If I reject, my next offer would be subject to further inflation
3. A 50-50 split is fair and we avoid losing more value in subsequent rounds
4. There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer from me in the next round"
