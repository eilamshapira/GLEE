"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she keeps $600,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll get to make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

Even if I proposed a very favorable split in the next round (like keeping $800,000 for myself), Alice might reject it since the money only depreciates 10% for her. She would still see the pot as worth $900,000 in the next round.

The offer of $400,000 now is less than ideal, but considering the significant inflation penalty I face, it might be better to accept now rather than risk getting even less in future rounds.
