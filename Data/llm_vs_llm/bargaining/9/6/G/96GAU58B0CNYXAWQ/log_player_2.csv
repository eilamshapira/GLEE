"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Even if I propose a more favorable split, Alice might reject
   - Further rounds mean more value loss due to inflation

The current offer gives me $50. If I reject, the best I could reasonably hope for might be $60 in the next round, but that would be worth $54 (after 10% inflation), and Alice might reject it anyway.
