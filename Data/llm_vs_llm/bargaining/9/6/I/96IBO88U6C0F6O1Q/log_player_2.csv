"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me the entire sum, which may seem beneficial, this is a negotiation. Given that Alice is more affected by inflation per round than I am (20% vs 0%), I have leverage to make a fair counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair proposal that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round while I face 0%, I'll offer a more balanced division that benefits us both.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose we split the money with $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. This is a fair division considering our different inflation rates, and it allows us both to receive a significant portion of the money."
