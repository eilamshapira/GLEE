"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
3. I can make a counter-offer in round 2
4. The split is not particularly fair, favoring Alice significantly
5. Given the different inflation rates, I might be able to negotiate a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 95% of original value
- For Alice: 90% of original value

Since Alice values the money less now, and I have the power to make an offer, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still favorable enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""A more balanced split that acknowledges both our positions. The longer we negotiate, the less value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has moved from 6000/4000 to 5800/4200, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. The money is now worth:
   - For me: 90.25% of original value
   - For Alice: 81% of original value
3. My real value: 4200 Ã— 0.9025 = 3790.5
4. Further delays will continue to erode value for both of us
5. While this isn't ideal, the rate of value loss is significant

Given the substantial inflation rates and the risk of further value loss, and Alice's movement toward compromise:
