525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation impact on your side. You'll get $475000 now, which is actually better than waiting and getting a larger nominal amount later due to the 5% inflation you face each round. If we both cooperate now, we both win substantially.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, let's split the $1000000 evenly at $500000 each. This way we both benefit equally from our cooperation.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand the desire for a 50-50 split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 5% value while mine doesn't. If we go to round 5, your $500K would only be worth about $427K in round 1 value. This 55-45 split is actually fair when accounting for your inflation factor, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose more value in future rounds.",Alice,3,

515000.0,485000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation factor on my side, let's aim for a slightly adjusted split with $485000 for me and $515000 for you. This should help account for the loss in value from inflation and allow us to both end up with a fair outcome sooner rather than later.",Bob,4,
