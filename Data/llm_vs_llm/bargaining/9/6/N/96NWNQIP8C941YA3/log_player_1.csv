"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation impact on your side. You'll get $475,000 now, which is actually better than waiting and getting a larger nominal amount later due to the 5% inflation you face each round. If we both cooperate now, we both win substantially.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the $1000000 evenly at $500000 each. This way we both benefit equally from our cooperation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand the desire for a 50-50 split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 5% value while mine doesn't. If we go to round 5, your $500K would only be worth about $427K in round 1 value. This 55-45 split is actually fair when accounting for your inflation factor, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose more value in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation factor on my side, let's aim for a slightly adjusted split with $485000 for me and $515000 for you. This should help account for the loss in value from inflation and allow us to both end up with a fair outcome sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 515000 
# Bob gain: 485000
