"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation impact on your side. You'll get $475000 now, which is actually better than waiting and getting a larger nominal amount later due to the 5% inflation you face each round. If we both cooperate now, we both win substantially. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split the $1,000,000 evenly at $500,000 each. This way we both benefit equally from our cooperation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the desire for a 50-50 split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 5% value while mine doesn't. If we go to round 5, your $500K would only be worth about $427K in round 1 value. This 55-45 split is actually fair when accounting for your inflation factor, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose more value in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 485000, ""alice_gain"": 515000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation factor on my side, let's aim for a slightly adjusted split with $485,000 for me and $515,000 for you. This should help account for the loss in value from inflation and allow us to both end up with a fair outcome sooner rather than later.""}"
