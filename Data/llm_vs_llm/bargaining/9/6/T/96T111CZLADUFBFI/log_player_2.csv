"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount of $4,000, it's not an equal split. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds (0% inflation), I can safely reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round that might be more favorable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm suggesting an equal 50-50 split of the money, which would give each of us $5,000. This is the fairest division and should be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now feeling the effects of inflation (19% on her end), while I still have no inflation penalty. She's improved her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500, but it's still not quite equal.

Given that Alice is now experiencing inflation pressure and has already rejected an even split, I should make a strategic decision. If I reject again, I can make another offer in the next round when Alice's inflation will be even higher, potentially getting better terms. However, there's also risk in prolonged negotiation.

Since I have no inflation pressure and can wait, I'll reject this improved but still uneven split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly adjusted offer that recognizes Alice's inflation situation while still being favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. Given that Alice is experiencing inflation on her end while I'm not affected by it, this division acknowledges the changing bargaining positions. This gives Alice an incentive to accept now rather than face further inflation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is now experiencing significant inflation - her gains are worth 34.39% less than in the first round, while my gains remain unaffected by inflation. Alice has now offered an equal 50-50 split, which is what I proposed in round 2.

Given that:
1. This is a fair equal split
2. Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure
3. Further negotiations might lead to more rounds and potentially more concessions from Alice, but also risk of reaching an impasse

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair division that gives me half of the total amount, and there's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate would yield a better outcome for me.
