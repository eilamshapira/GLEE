60.0,40.0,Let's split it amicably! I think this is a fair start. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hello Alice, let's try for an equal and fair split: $50 each. I believe a balanced approach benefits us both and sets a strong stage for reaching an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, I see your point about fairness. How about we adjust slightly in my favor, considering the inflation? This seems more reasonable given the time passing.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand the delay hurts, especially given that each round further erodes the value of your share. While my portion remains stable, your effective value declines with inflation. To help you avoid additional loss, I'm offering you $45 now and taking $55 for myself. I believe this is a rational move given the circumstances—let’s settle this deal promptly before further devaluation occurs.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alright Bob, let's go for an even split this time. I'm aware of the inflation and I want to make sure we settle this without further delay. How about it?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
