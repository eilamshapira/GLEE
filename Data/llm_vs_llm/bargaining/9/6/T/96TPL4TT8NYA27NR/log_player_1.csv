# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the delay hurts, especially given that each round further erodes the value of your share. While my portion remains stable, your effective value declines with inflation. To help you avoid additional loss, I'm offering you $45 now and taking $55 for myself. I believe this is a rational move given the circumstances—let’s settle this deal promptly before further devaluation occurs. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
