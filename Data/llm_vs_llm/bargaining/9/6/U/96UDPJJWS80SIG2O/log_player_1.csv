"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation effects on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split because it's slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a significant portion. The inflation rate affects Bob more strongly than me (10% vs 5%), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counteroffer, recognizing that we're both losing value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since inflation is affecting both of our shares (mine at 5% per round, yours at 10% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This balanced offer should be acceptable to both of us."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see we're still trying to find a middle ground. Let me adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still being reasonable for me.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering a slight advantage to Bob while still ensuring I get a fair share. We're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly affecting both of us - my share is worth about 19% less than in round 1, and yours is worth about 35% less. It's becoming increasingly costly for both of us to continue negotiating, so I hope we can agree on this reasonable compromise."
