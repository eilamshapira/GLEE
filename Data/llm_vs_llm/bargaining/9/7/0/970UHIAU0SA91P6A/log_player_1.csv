I'm aiming slightly higher than Bob's offer, considering the inflation will further diminish his gains if he rejects this."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point.  The longer the game goes on, the less value my potential gains hold due to the higher inflation rate I face. Accepting a 550,000 payout now outweighs the risk of receiving an even lower offer later."
