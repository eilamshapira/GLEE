"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an even 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be 5% less for me. Let me evaluate:

Current offer: $5,000 for me
If I reject and we go another round, I'd need to offer more than $5,000 to Alice to get her to accept, and the total pot would be worth 5% less to me.

Since this is a fair split and rejecting would result in decreased value, I'll accept.
