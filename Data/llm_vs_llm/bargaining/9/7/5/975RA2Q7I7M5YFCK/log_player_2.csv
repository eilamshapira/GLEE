"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since we have 12 rounds total, and with each round the money is worth 5% less to Alice (while it stays the same value for me), I might get a better deal if I reject and make my own offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation effect for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and recognizes that with each passing round, the value of money decreases for Alice. If she rejects this, she'll face 5% inflation on her share in future rounds, so this is actually a reasonable deal for her to accept now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4512 
# Alice gain: 5488 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice's offer is now less favorable to me than her first offer. She's now offering me $4512 compared to $4750 before, which doesn't make sense since her money is worth less with each round due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the increasing inflation Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

Since we're now in round 4, Alice is facing significant inflation - her money is worth nearly 10% less than in round 1, and this will continue to increase. If we continue negotiating for several more rounds, her position weakens. This offer gives her a substantial amount while recognizing the time pressure she faces due to inflation. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, especially for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offers are getting worse for me each round, which is surprising since the inflation affects her negatively, not me. She's now offering me only $4300, down from $4512 in round 3 and $4750 in round 1.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our current position in the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

We're now in round 6, halfway through our negotiation window. The inflation effect means Alice's share is worth over 20% less than it would have been in round 1. Each round we continue, her position weakens due to this 5% per round inflation. 

This offer gives Alice $4500, which given the current inflation would still be worth more to her than a larger amount several rounds from now. It's increasingly in Alice's interest to reach an agreement soon, and this offer reflects the changing bargaining position due to the inflation that only affects her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to offer me less each round ($4750 → $4512 → $4300 → $4200) despite her worsening position due to inflation. This doesn't seem like a strategic approach from her perspective.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more assertive offer based on our current position in the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

We're now in round 8 of 12, and the inflation effect has significantly reduced the value of Alice's potential gains. At this point, her share is worth over 30% less than it would have been in round 1, and this disadvantage will only increase in the remaining rounds.

This offer reflects the reality of our bargaining positions. Even though the nominal amount for Alice is lower, accepting now would be better for her than continuing to negotiate while her potential share loses more value with each round. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing - which would be especially disadvantageous for Alice given the time she's already invested in a negotiation where time works against her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offers continue to get worse for me with each round. She's now offering me only $4100, which is even less than her previous offers, despite the fact that inflation is significantly affecting her position, not mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that reflects our approaching deadline and the significant inflation impact on Alice's share.

{""bob_gain"": 6100, ""alice_gain"": 3900}

We're now in round 10 of 12, with only two more rounds remaining after this one. At this point, Alice's potential share has lost over 35% of its value compared to round 1 due to inflation, and this will worsen if we continue.

This offer acknowledges our current bargaining positions. For Alice, accepting $3900 now would actually provide more real value than getting a larger nominal amount in round 12, when inflation will have reduced the value of her share by over 40%.

We're rapidly approaching our deadline of 12 rounds, after which we both receive nothing. Given the significant inflation penalty only Alice faces, reaching an agreement now is increasingly in her best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to offer me less with each round, now down to $4000. Given that we're at round 11 of 12, and if we don't reach an agreement in the final round we both get nothing, I need to carefully consider this offer.

If I reject and we move to round 12, I'd make the final offer, but Alice would have to accept it or we both get nothing. At that point, her share would be worth about 45% less than in round 1.

While $4000 is less than I'd like, it's better than risking getting nothing if she rejects my final offer in round 12.
