"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my $55 now has less value.

Let's calculate the effective value: $55 - (10% of $55) = $55 - $5.50 = $49.50

Since the value of the money I get is now less, I will have to make a decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3.  I have to make a strategic decision, as the money I receive continues to lose value.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4, considering the accumulated inflation.

*   **Initial Alice Gain:** $50
*   **Inflation:** 27.1% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of my gain:
$50 - (27.1% of $50) = $50 - $13.55 = $36.45

Given the significant decrease in the value of my share due to inflation, and the fact that the offer is now equal, I'll make the following decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 5. The value of my money continues to diminish, so I need to be more assertive. I'll make the following offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 6, with the accumulated inflation in mind.

*   **Initial Alice Gain:** $45
*   **Inflation:** 40.95% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of my gain:
$45 - (40.95% of $45) = $45 - $18.43 = $26.57

Considering the decreased value of the money I would receive, and the fact that this is a lower gain than previous offers, I must consider my options carefully.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7. The persistent inflation makes me more aggressive with my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 8. The inflation continues to erode the value of my share.

*   **Initial Alice Gain:** $40
*   **Inflation:** 52.17% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of my gain:
$40 - (52.17% of $40) = $40 - $20.87 = $19.13

The value of the money I receive is now quite low due to inflation. I need to decide if I should accept a low amount or try again with my offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 9. With the value of the money I'm receiving still greatly affected by inflation, I need to make a strong offer to try and secure a larger portion of the remaining value.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 10. Inflation has significantly diminished the value of my potential gains.

*   **Initial Alice Gain:** $35
*   **Inflation:** 61.26% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of my gain:
$35 - (61.26% of $35) = $35 - $21.44 = $13.56

The value of the money I would receive is now quite low because of the inflation. I need to weigh my options carefully. The remaining value is less, but it's better than nothing.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, we're in Round 11. The value of my money is continuing to decrease due to inflation, so I need to be very assertive with my offer.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's the final round, Round 12. The inflation has severely impacted the value of my share. Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

*   **Initial Alice Gain:** $30
*   **Inflation:** 68.62% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of my gain:
$30 - (68.62% of $30) = $30 - $20.59 = $9.41

I have nothing to lose. If I don't accept the offer, both of us will receive nothing. Even though the amount is low, it's the only chance to get anything.
