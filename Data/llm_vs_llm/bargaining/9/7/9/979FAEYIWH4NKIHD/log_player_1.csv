"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us. Since there's no inflation for me, we can both walk away with a substantial amount right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have no inflation, but I do. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me. This offer is still generous to you, and I hope you'll accept it so we can both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
