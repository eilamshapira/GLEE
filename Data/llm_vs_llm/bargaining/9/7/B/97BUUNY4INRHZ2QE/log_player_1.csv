"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting an equal split of the $10,000. This way we both get a fair share of $5,000 each. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with this even division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affects me, I need a bit more. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, I can compensate for the loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
