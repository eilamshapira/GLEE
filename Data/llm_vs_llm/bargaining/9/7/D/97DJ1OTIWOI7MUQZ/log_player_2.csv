"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 
$450,000 is a substantial amount, but it's less than half of the total.
If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will decrease by 10%.
That means the next round will have $900,000 to split.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation and potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
This is a reasonable first offer, giving me 45% of the total.
