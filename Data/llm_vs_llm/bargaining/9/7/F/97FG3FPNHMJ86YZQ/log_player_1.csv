"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5174, ""bob_gain"": 4826, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $5,174 and you get $4,826. This offer reflects the strategic value we both face in our alternating-offer game considering the 20% devaluation each round. I believe this is fair given our future prospects. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% devaluation per round, I propose a split of $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This offer takes into account the urgency to settle before the value drops further. Let's agree on this to maximize our gains! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Considering the rapid devaluation of the total amount as we progress, your offer of $4800 for me (and $5200 for you) in round 2 provides me with a reasonable share relative to my future alternatives. I accept your deal so we can both secure as much value as possible before inflation takes its toll.""}"
