"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer, splitting the amount almost equally but giving Bob a slightly larger share as a gesture of goodwill.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this division because I believe it's fair and generous, showing I'm willing to cooperate while also maintaining a reasonable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this unbalanced offer as it's too heavily skewed in Bob's favor. My initial offer was much more equitable, and there's still plenty of time to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer slightly, still aiming for fairness but showing some flexibility.

{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100}

This offer is very close to a 50-50 split, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a fair agreement while still maintaining a cooperative approach. The slight advantage to Bob shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's still too unbalanced. While Bob has moved slightly from their previous offer of 6000/4000, a split of 5800/4200 is still significantly unfair. There are still many rounds left to negotiate a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me try a slightly different approach while still maintaining fairness.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfect 50-50 split, which is the most objectively fair division possible. This demonstrates my commitment to absolute fairness and should be difficult for Bob to argue against from a rational perspective."
