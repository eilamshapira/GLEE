Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly equal split of 50-50. This is the fairest possible division and eliminates any potential feelings of unfairness from either side. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, literally! Let's settle this now. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me than your previous offer, but still fair considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical - with the current inflation affecting your gains, this split actually gives us both comparable real value. It's a fair solution that acknowledges our current situation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, as Bob is clearly playing hardball and taking advantage of the inflation working against me. However, if I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in the next round. It's better to accept a less than ideal offer now than risk losing even more."
