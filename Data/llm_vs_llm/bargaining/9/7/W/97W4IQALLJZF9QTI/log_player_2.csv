"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this division is fair and benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
- Her gain would be $6000 (60%)
- There's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds
- I can make a counter-offer if I reject
- While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while being diplomatic:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal split of 50-50. This is the fairest possible division and eliminates any potential feelings of unfairness from either side.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Let's settle this now. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me than your previous offer, but still fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's offering me $4500 out of $10000 (45%)
- Her gain would be $5500, but due to 19% inflation, it's worth about $4455 to her
- I know future inflation will continue to affect her but not me
- Her offer is better than her first one, but the inflation is working in my favor
- I can likely get a better deal by continuing, as inflation is hurting her position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that inflation is affecting Alice's gains but not mine, I'll maintain a firm but reasonable position:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - with the current inflation affecting your gains, this split actually gives us both comparable real value. It's a fair solution that acknowledges our current situation.""}"
