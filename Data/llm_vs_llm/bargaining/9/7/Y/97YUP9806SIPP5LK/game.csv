6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 55-45. It's in our best interest to agree soon.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. The inflation is hitting me harder (20% per round) than you (5% per round), so this is actually quite fair. We should agree soon before both our shares lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation disparity, I'm willing to take a bit more. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable, given the circumstances. Let's finalize this before more value is lost.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, the inflation is severely impacting my gains - I'm already losing nearly 50% of value while you're only losing about 14%. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this difference. This 65-35 split would give us both similar real values after inflation. Let's agree now before we both lose more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I understand the inflation disparity, but I'm not willing to give up that much. A 65-35 split in my favor is more reasonable, considering I'm still losing value, just at a slower rate. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With my 73.78% inflation and your 26.49% inflation in the next round, a 70-30 split would give us both approximately $1800 in real value. This is truly fair - we'd both walk away with similar actual money. Please consider carefully, as we're running out of rounds.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I've done the math, and considering the significant inflation disparity, a 70-30 split in my favor is the most reasonable offer. We're running out of time, and I'm willing to give you a substantial amount, but I won't compromise further. Let's finalize this before the value drops even more.",Bob,8,
