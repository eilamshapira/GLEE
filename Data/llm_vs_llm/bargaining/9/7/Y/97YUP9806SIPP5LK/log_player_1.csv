"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 55-45. It's in our best interest to agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it gives me less than my initial proposal, and with the 20% inflation impact on my share, the real value would be even lower. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. The inflation is hitting me harder (20% per round) than you (5% per round), so this is actually quite fair. We should agree soon before both our shares lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation disparity, I'm willing to take a bit more. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable, given the circumstances. Let's finalize this before more value is lost. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with the severe 48.8% inflation impact on my share, the real value would only be around $2,048. This is too low considering we started with $10,000. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for the increasing inflation impact."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is severely impacting my gains - I'm already losing nearly 50% of value while you're only losing about 14%. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this difference. This 65-35 split would give us both similar real values after inflation. Let's agree now before we both lose more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but I'm not willing to give up that much. A 65-35 split in my favor is more reasonable, considering I'm still losing value, just at a slower rate. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer would leave me with only $1,147 in real value after the 67.23% inflation (3500 * (1-0.6723)), while Bob would keep $5,029 in real value after his 22.62% inflation (6500 * (1-0.2262)). The difference is too extreme. I'll make a counter-offer that better balances our real final values."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With my 73.78% inflation and your 26.49% inflation in the next round, a 70-30 split would give us both approximately $1,800 in real value. This is truly fair - we'd both walk away with similar actual money. Please consider carefully, as we're running out of rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've done the math, and considering the significant inflation disparity, a 70-30 split in my favor is the most reasonable offer. We're running out of time, and I'm willing to give you a substantial amount, but I won't compromise further. Let's finalize this before the value drops even more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while not ideal, with only 4 rounds left and rapidly increasing inflation, it's becoming too risky to continue negotiating. With my 79.03% inflation, I'll get about $629 in real value (3000 * (1-0.7903)), and Bob will get about $4,888 in real value (7000 * (1-0.3017)). While this is quite uneven, continuing to negotiate could result in both of us getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time."
