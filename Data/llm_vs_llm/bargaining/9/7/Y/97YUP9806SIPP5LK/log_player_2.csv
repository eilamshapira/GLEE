# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. The inflation is hitting me harder (20% per round) than you (5% per round), so this is actually quite fair. We should agree soon before both our shares lose more value.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is severely impacting my gains - I'm already losing nearly 50% of value while you're only losing about 14%. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this difference. This 65-35 split would give us both similar real values after inflation. Let's agree now before we both lose more.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With my 73.78% inflation and your 26.49% inflation in the next round, a 70-30 split would give us both approximately $1800 in real value. This is truly fair - we'd both walk away with similar actual money. Please consider carefully, as we're running out of rounds.
