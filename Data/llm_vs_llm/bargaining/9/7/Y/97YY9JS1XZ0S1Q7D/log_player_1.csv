"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 20% inflation per round and I only face 5%, this split is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate. You'll get $4500 now rather than a depreciated amount later. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
