"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 while taking $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round
4. This works in my favor, as Alice has more to lose from delay

Given that Alice has a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. The current 40/60 split isn't favorable enough given this dynamic.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than risk losing 20% value in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you face 20% inflation per round and I only face 5%, this split is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate. You'll get $4500 now rather than a depreciated amount later.""}"
