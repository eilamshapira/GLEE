"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: you get the full $100 and I take nothing. I know that if you wait until round 2 you can propose a split that, given the 20% per round devaluation I face, effectively gives you almost all the money anyway. Accepting this offer now avoids any delay. I hope you'll agree to settle immediately. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
