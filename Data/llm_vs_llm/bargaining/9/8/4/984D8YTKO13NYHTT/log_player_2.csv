"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer to give me $40 while she keeps $60. 

With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, if I reject now and propose next round, even if I managed to get a larger share, it would be worth less. For example, if I could get $50 in the next round, that would only be worth $45 to me due to 10% inflation.

Given this inflation pressure, $40 now is probably better than hoping for significantly more in future rounds where the total value keeps decreasing.
