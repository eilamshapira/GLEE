Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it 50-50. With inflation affecting me more, I think this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but considering the significant difference in our inflation rates, I believe a 50-50 split doesn't account for the fact that my money loses value much slower than yours. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.""

# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
