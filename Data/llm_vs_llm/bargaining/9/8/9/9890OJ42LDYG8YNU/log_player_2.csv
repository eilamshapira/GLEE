"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob â€“ since every extra round cuts 20% off my share, let's settle now. I propose you get $550K and I take $450K. This way you secure a strong, immediate gain while we both avoid the costly delays. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $550,000 and I don't know the exact inflation effect on her, but I do know the 10% inflation effect on me, I should consider the potential loss of value in the next round. 

Given that I get to keep $550,000, which is 55% of the total, and considering the risk of losing 10% of my potential gain in the next round, I think this is a reasonable offer.
