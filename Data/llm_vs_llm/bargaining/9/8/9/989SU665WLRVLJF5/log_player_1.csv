"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $5,000, which is an equitable division that respects both our interests."
