"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for the division of $100 in Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a substantial amount. This increases the likelihood of acceptance in the first round, avoiding the penalties of future rounds due to inflation."
