I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping to end this quickly.  I'll be taking the majority, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to get things started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still willing to take the larger share, but I'm increasing Bob's offer slightly to try and get this done.  I'm hoping to end this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains too much."

Round 4

I'm going to be more flexible this time. While I still want the majority of the money, I'm willing to give Bob a larger share to try and reach an agreement. I hope we can come to a resolution before the value of our potential gains drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a significant loss for me, but the inflation is making this situation worse with each round. I'm willing to accept this offer, as rejecting it could lead to even worse outcomes.  It's better to get something than to risk losing everything."
