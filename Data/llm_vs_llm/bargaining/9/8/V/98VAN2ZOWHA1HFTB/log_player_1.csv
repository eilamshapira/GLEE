"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, slightly more for me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but its value will be 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own loss due to inflation.

In Round 1, the value was $10,000.
In Round 2, the value for me was $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000, and for Bob, it was $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.
In Round 3, the value for me is $8,000 * 0.8 = $6,400, and for Bob, it's $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's more favorable to Bob, hoping he'll accept:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a decent split, consider the inflation""}"
