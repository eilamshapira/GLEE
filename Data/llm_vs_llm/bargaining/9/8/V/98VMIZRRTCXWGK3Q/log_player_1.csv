"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation rates for both of us. Since I'm going first, I'll propose a split that is slightly in my favor, but hopefully still attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his lower inflation rate.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm hoping Bob sees $4500 as a good deal now, rather than risking further devaluation by rejecting my offer. I also want to secure a larger portion for myself early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering a 50/50 split. I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My perspective:** $5000 now is worth 20% less than $5000 in round 1. So it's worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 in round 1 dollars.
*   **My perspective if I reject:** If I reject, the money will be worth another 20% less in round 3 (relative to round 2).

I will accept.
