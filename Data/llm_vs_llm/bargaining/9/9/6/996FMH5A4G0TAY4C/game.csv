,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Let's settle this fairly. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. It's a reasonable split considering the time and inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob. Since you rejected my initial offer, and we're dealing with diminishing returns, how about we split it 60/40 in my favor this time? Final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems fair and urgent. Let's end this now before our shares lose even more value.",Bob,4,
