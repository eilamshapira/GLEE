"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division as a balanced first offer. I'm taking slightly more than half because if Bob declines and we go to another round, the value will decrease by 20% for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $36 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (40% less than original value)
- Even if I propose a higher split for myself in the next round, Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given this, I should accept this offer now to minimize my losses from inflation.
