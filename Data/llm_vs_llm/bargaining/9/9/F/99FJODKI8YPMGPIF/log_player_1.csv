"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2083, ""bob_gain"": 7917, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $2083 and you get $7917. Given that each extra round costs me 20% and you 5%, I believe this split – which rewards our respective patience – is fair. Let’s agree now to avoid the devaluation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was quite low. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  This reflects a fairer share of the risk we both face with inflation, especially you.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
