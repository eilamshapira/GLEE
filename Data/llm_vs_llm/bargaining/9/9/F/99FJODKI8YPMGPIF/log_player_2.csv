"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $2083 and you get $7917. Given that each extra round costs me 20% and you 5%, I believe this split – which rewards our respective patience – is fair. Let’s agree now to avoid the devaluation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 7917 
# Alice gain: 2083 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was quite low. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  This reflects a fairer share of the risk we both face with inflation, especially you.  What do you say?""}"
