"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning even if I got the entire $100, it would only be worth $90 to me.

A fair 50-50 split in the first round seems reasonable, and trying to negotiate for more would likely result in a worse outcome due to inflation.
