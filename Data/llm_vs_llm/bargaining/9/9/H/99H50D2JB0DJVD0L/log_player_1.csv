Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your offer was meant to be fair, but with inflation, I need to secure a better deal for myself. This offer ensures we both get a decent amount, considering the rounds we have left. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Given the rounds we've wasted, and the further loss of value for me, this is the best I can do.  Take it now, or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Bob, and I'm betting he's bluffing about it being his final offer.  The inflation is hurting him more than me, and I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more agreeable in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and this offer still gives you a decent share considering the inflation. Don't be greedy.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. My share is significantly devalued now. This is the best I can offer without taking a complete loss. Accept, or we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the time pressure is on, Bob's losses are growing more rapidly with each round. He needs a deal, and I'm betting he'll concede more in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  Take this offer, or I'm walking away.  You're losing more with every 'no'.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're on the brink of getting nothing. This is a perfectly even split, the fairest deal possible. Let's end this now and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than nothing. Bob's losses are significant, and he's unlikely to offer more. Accepting now guarantees I get something."
