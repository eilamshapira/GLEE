600000.0,400000.0,"Let's split this fairly. I think this is a good starting point, Bob.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, to avoid any further delays (and potential unknown inflation effects for you) I propose we settle now with a division of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This swift agreement protects both our interests. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob. Since we're still negotiating, and the value is decreasing for me, I'm adjusting my offer slightly. Let's try this. The inflation is affecting me more and more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I know we both want to settle quickly to minimize losses from inflation. Every additional round further erodes the real value of your share, while my amount remains unaffected. Accepting my current offer of $600000 for me and $400000 for you now guarantees you a better outcome than risking even steeper devaluation. Let's end this game on time and protect both our interests.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, the value is diminishing for me. Let's try this again. This is getting very expensive.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, each extra round chips away at the value of your share while my amount remains steady. Accepting my offer now means you'll secure a nominal $350000—far better than risking further devaluation. Let's settle this deal immediately before the numbers shrink further on your side.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alright Bob, let's try one last time. I think this is a fair split. It's time to end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, every additional round further diminishes the real value of your share while my amount is unaffected. With your funds currently suffering a heavy devaluation, accepting this offer means you secure $300000 nominally, which is far more beneficial than risking even steeper losses in the next round. Let’s end this negotiation now and prevent further erosion of your gains.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Okay Bob, this is the last offer. I'm getting hurt by inflation. This is it.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, we're now in the final round. At this point, your share is worth roughly 65% less than the original value, while my share is unaffected. Accepting $250000 now is far more advantageous for you than risking even more devaluation. This is my final offer—let's settle and end the game before further losses hit your side.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, I'm losing a lot more here. Let's settle on this. It's what I had offered originally.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, consider the harsh reality: every additional round continues to erode the real value of your share while mine remains intact. With further delays, you're set to lose even more. Accepting my offer of $200000 for you now locks in what little value you have left, versus the inevitable further decline. Let's settle this round now before the situation worsens.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, I have to accept what is being offered, given the situation we are in. This is the final offer.",Alice,13,
,,,Bob,13,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, the relentless pace of inflation means that every extra moment chips away at the value of your share. Right now, your $150000 is all that's left in terms of the original value, while mine remains intact. This is my final offer—settle now and avoid the even harsher losses that lie ahead for you in any further negotiations.",Bob,14,
,,,Alice,14,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, this is getting painful. It's time to accept this and end this game.",Alice,15,
