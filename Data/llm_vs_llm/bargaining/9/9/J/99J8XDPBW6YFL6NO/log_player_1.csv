"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round and establish a cooperative tone.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable division that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offering me $4,500 and taking $5,500
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $5,500 is actually worth only $4,400 (80% of $5,500) to him
3. My $4,500 is still worth full value since inflation doesn't affect me
4. If I reject, we move to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's inflation will increase further

Since I'll get $4,500 at full value, which is actually more than Bob's inflation-adjusted gain of $4,400, this is a reasonable offer. Additionally, prolonging the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation on Bob's side.
