"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further delays and the risks associated with inflation. I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500 to settle quickly. I believe this compromise reflects the costs of waiting and benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
