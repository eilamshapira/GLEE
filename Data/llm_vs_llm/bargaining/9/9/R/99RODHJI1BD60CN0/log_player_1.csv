I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 9000 and Bob taking 1000.  This seems fair, as I'm the one initiating the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer a slightly lower split than before, but still a generous one.  Given the inflation and his rejection of my previous offer, I hope this makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
