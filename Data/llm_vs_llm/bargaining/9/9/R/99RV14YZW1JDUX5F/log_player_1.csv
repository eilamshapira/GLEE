Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep it simple and equally split the amount at $5000 each. This way we ensure fairness and avoid any inflation loss while we negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
