"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty per round for Alice, her money will be worth less if we continue.
3. I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer.
4. We still have 11 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation.
5. Since Alice's money loses value each round but mine doesn't, I have leverage to ask for more.

I'll reject this offer and propose a split more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's fair 50-50 split, I should propose something that takes into account the 5% per round inflation penalty that affects only Alice. By the next round, Alice's share would be worth 5% less to her, so she has an incentive to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than wait.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a moderate increase from the 50-50 split while not being too aggressive.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

My reasoning: ""I propose a 60-40 split, considering that waiting will reduce the value of your share due to inflation."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from 50 to 55, showing willingness to negotiate.
2. The inflation penalty for Alice is now at 9.75%, meaning her $45 is actually worth about $40.61 to her.
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where her inflation penalty will be even higher.
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but the increasing inflation makes each round more costly for Alice.
5. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, this is a reasonable improvement from the initial offer.
6. There's also risk in pushing too hard - if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that Alice has moved significantly in my direction and the risk of continued negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
