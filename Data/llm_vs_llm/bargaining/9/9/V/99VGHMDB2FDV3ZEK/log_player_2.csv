"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

Let's wait to see what happens in the next round. Alice will lose some money while I won't."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I rejected your previous offer. Now, I want a bit more since the money is losing value for me. Let's settle?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I rejected your previous offer. Now, I want a bit more since the money is losing value for you. Let's settle? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I would still get $45, and if we prolong this, I will keep losing money. Let's settle."
