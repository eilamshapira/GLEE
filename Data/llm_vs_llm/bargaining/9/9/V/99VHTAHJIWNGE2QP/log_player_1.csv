"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rejection of your previous offer and considering the inflation rates, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that while your money loses value faster, I also face inflation, albeit at a lower rate. Let's find a balance that acknowledges both our situations. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the inflation rates, if I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, my money would be worth another 20% less (so my $4500 would effectively be worth $3600), while Bob's portion would only decrease by 5%. It's better to accept $4500 now than risk getting even less value in future rounds. The 45-55 split, while not ideal, is reasonable considering the asymmetric inflation rates."
