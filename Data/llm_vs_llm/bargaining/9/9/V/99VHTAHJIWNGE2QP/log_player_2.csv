"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the higher inflation rate I face. This is fair since my money loses value faster than yours. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Given the rejection of your previous offer and considering the inflation rates, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that while your money loses value faster, I also face inflation, albeit at a lower rate. Let's find a balance that acknowledges both our situations.""
