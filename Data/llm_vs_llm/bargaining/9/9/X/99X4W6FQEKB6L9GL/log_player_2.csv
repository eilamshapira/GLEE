"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. A 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't fair when starting negotiations. Given there's no inflation impact on my side, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a truly fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with an equal share.""}

I'm making a reasonable counter-offer that represents true fairness, moving from Alice's 60-40 split to an equal 50-50 division. This is a standard opening negotiation position that gives room for further discussion if needed while maintaining fairness as the central principle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 50%.  Let's split it 55/45. This way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Alice has moved significantly from her initial 60-40 split to a more reasonable 55-45 split. Given that:
1. Alice is experiencing inflation effects (9.75% less value for her)
2. We've already gone through 3 rounds
3. The offer is much closer to a fair split than the initial one
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

It's sensible to accept this compromise rather than risk further negotiations that might lead to worse outcomes for both of us."
