"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, acknowledging that with different inflation rates, it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Bob gets a substantial portion while I take a bit more than half."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that still gives me a slight advantage. Since we both face inflation with each round (mine at 10% and Bob's at 20%), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split. Given the inflation affecting both of us (with Bob's inflation rate higher than mine), it's becoming increasingly important that we reach an agreement. This fair division should be acceptable to both of us."
