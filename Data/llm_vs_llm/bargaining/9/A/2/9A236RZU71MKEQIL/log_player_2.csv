Explanation: Since the money is losing value for both of us, it's important to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering a slight advantage to myself this time, but it's still a fair division considering the circumstances. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

Explanation: At this point, accepting an even split is reasonable. The value of the money has decreased significantly for me, and we need to reach an agreement before the money loses more value. It's better to secure an even split now rather than risking further devaluation."
