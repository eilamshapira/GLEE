"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is:
- Me (Bob): $450,000
- Alice: $550,000

While Alice is taking a slightly larger share, this is actually a pretty reasonable first offer. Here's why I should consider accepting:

1. It's close to a 50-50 split (45%-55%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round ($800,000 total)
3. Even if I could get a better percentage next round, the absolute amount might be lower due to inflation
4. We have limited rounds, and prolonging negotiations is risky

Given these factors, this is a good enough offer to accept. The difference between our shares ($100,000) is less than what we'd lose to inflation by continuing to negotiate.
