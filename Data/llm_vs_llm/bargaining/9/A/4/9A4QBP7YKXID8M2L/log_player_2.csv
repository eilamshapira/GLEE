"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offered a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   * A $50 offer now is worth more than a $55 offer next round
   * $50 now > $55 Ã— 0.9 = $49.5 next round

The 50-50 split is fair, and waiting would actually reduce my purchasing power due to inflation. I should accept this offer.
