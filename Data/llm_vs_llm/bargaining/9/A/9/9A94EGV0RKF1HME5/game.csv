600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'm taking 60% and you get 40%. Accept and we both win!,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's a straightforward deal that benefits us both equally. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"How about I take 55% and you get 45%? It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation affecting me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,I understand the inflation is affecting your share significantly. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take 48% and you get 52%. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation impact on your side while still being better than a 45-55 split. Let's close this deal now before inflation reduces the value further for you.,Bob,4,
