Round 4

# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is affecting your share significantly. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take 48% and you get 52%. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation impact on your side while still being better than a 45-55 split. Let's close this deal now before inflation reduces the value further for you.
