"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm taking 60% and you get 40%. Accept and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 (40%) while she takes $600,000 (60%). While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal. Also, I know inflation won't affect my portion, so I don't have pressure from that perspective.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being reasonable, considering that inflation doesn't affect my portion.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's a straightforward deal that benefits us both equally. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about I take 55% and you get 45%? It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation. Alice has reduced her demand from 60% to 55%, offering me $450,000 instead of the previous $400,000. She mentions inflation is affecting her portion (which is now worth 36% less to her), while my portion maintains its full value. This explains why she's still asking for more than 50%.

Given that:
1. The offer is better than her first one
2. I know inflation is significantly impacting her side
3. There's still a substantial amount of rounds left, but the inflation might get worse for her
4. $450,000 is still a very good amount, and it's certain if I accept now

However, I think I can still get a slightly better deal, and since inflation doesn't affect my portion, I can afford to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I now understand that Alice is affected by significant inflation (36% already), I'll make a more strategic offer that acknowledges this reality while still improving my position slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation is affecting your share significantly. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take 48% and you get 52%. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation impact on your side while still being better than a 45-55 split. Let's close this deal now before inflation reduces the value further for you.""}"
