"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6896.55, ""bob_gain"": 3103.45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a quick agreement. Based on our differing discount rates in future rounds (mine 5% per round, yours 10%), I’m offering you $3,103.45 and keeping $6,896.55 for myself. This split reflects the advantage you’d have as proposer later but also the cost you’d incur due to depreciation. I believe this is a fair, equilibrium offer for both of us. Let's settle now and avoid further losses!""}"
