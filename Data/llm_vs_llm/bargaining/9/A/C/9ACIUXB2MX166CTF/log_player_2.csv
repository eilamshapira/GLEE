"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a quick agreement. Based on our differing discount rates in future rounds (mine 5% per round, yours 10%), I’m offering you $3103.45 and keeping $6896.55 for myself. This split reflects the advantage you’d have as proposer later but also the cost you’d incur due to depreciation. I believe this is a fair, equilibrium offer for both of us. Let's settle now and avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 3103.45 
# Alice gain: 6896.55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $3,103.45 out of $10,000

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice
- So we'll be dividing money that's effectively worth $9,000 to me and $9,500 to Alice

3. Key consideration:
- As the proposer next round, I could make a more favorable offer
- But the 10% depreciation means I need to get significantly more to make up for the loss
- I would need to get at least $3,448 next round to be better off than accepting $3,103 now

While I could potentially get more in the next round, the steep 10% depreciation on my side makes this a risky strategy. Alice has crafted this offer knowing the depreciation rates, and it's actually a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
