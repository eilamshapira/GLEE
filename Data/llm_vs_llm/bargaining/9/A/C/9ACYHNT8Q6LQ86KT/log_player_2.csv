"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value of the money by 20% for me.

After inflation, the $1,000,000 would be worth only $800,000 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a fair 50/50 split then, I'd get $400,000, which would be worth the same as accepting Alice's current offer. But there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer.

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable size of the current offer, I'll accept.
