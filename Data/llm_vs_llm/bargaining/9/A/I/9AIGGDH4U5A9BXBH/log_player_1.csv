Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. Let's not lose any more money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
