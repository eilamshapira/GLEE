"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both get $500000. Remember that with inflation affecting each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This is an equal division that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account inflation (and trying to be more appealing than my last offer, which Bob rejected):

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, this is my revised offer. I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. Inflation is eating away at the value, so let's try to get this done now and move on.""
