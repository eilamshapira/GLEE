"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to take 60% of the money, leaving me with 40%. While this isn't an even split, I should remember that inflation will reduce the value of my money by 20% each round, so waiting could be costly for me.

If I reject and move to round 2, my counteroffer would need to be good enough for Alice to accept, or we risk continued rounds with increasing inflation effects.

Given the significant inflation penalty, I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal, but I should be mindful not to drag this out too long.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both get $500,000. Remember that with inflation affecting each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This is an equal division that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my revised offer. I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. Inflation is eating away at the value, so let's try to get this done now and move on. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me. Considering inflation effects, if I wait and we continue to later rounds, the value continues to decrease at 20% per round. I'm already facing a 36% reduction from the original value.

If I reject this and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and we could lose more value through inflation. Alice's offer is now closer to an even split than her first offer was.

Given the inflation pressure and the improved offer, I'll accept this proposal.
