264908.0,735092.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so that you receive $735092 and I keep $264908. Given that waiting would discount your future dollars by 5% per round, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect in a later round. I believe it’s a fair, time‐sensitive split. Let’s agree and finish the game!",Alice,1,

390000.0,610000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion. Accepting now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, I believe that waiting another round works in my favor given that my dollars aren’t discounted and will allow us to reach a more balanced deal. I'm rejecting your offer and looking forward to proposing a division in round 3.",Alice,2,reject
226000.0,774000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose we settle now: I take $226000 and you get $774000. With your money discounted at 0.95² (i.e. about 90.25% of its nominal value) in this round, your effective payoff would be roughly $774000 × 0.9025 ≈ $698337. This matches what you’d expect to secure as the proposer in Round 4. Accepting this offer now spares you further depreciation, and I believe it’s a fair resolution. Let’s agree and finish the game!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the devaluation.  Let's wrap this up.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort. However, with your money devaluing further in subsequent rounds while mine remain steady, I can secure a better deal by proposing in round 5. Therefore, I must reject your offer and look forward to making my proposal in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
990000.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $990000 and you get $10000. As you know, every round you wait reduces the value of your dollars by 5% while mine remain fully intact. If you reject this, you'll step into Round 6 as the proposer, but then you'll have to offer me nearly the entire pot in Round 7 given that I don’t face any devaluation. In effect, your continuation value is almost nothing. I believe this offer—though skewed—is the only rational way to maximize outcomes given the time pressure and discounting. I urge you to accept so we can wrap this up quickly.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline. Take this deal, or you risk walking away with nothing. It's time to be realistic.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your ""lifeline"" offer. However, by waiting until Round 7 when I propose again, I can leverage your further discount—your future dollars will be worth even less. Given that, I’m better off rejecting this deal and moving forward with the next round. Let’s continue, and I’ll present my proposal in Round 7.",Alice,6,reject
190000.0,810000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 7 I’m offering you $810000 while I take $190000. With the current discount rate, your money is worth only about 70% of its face value, so your effective payoff would be roughly $567000. If you wait for the next round, further discounting will likely erode your share even more. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome than postponing the settlement. Let’s conclude the game now with these terms.",Alice,7,
