"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 264908, ""bob_gain"": 735092, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so that you receive $735,092 and I keep $264,908. Given that waiting would discount your future dollars by 5% per round, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect in a later round. I believe it’s a fair, time‐sensitive split. Let’s agree and finish the game!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion. Accepting now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 390000 
# Bob gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, I believe that waiting another round works in my favor given that my dollars aren’t discounted and will allow us to reach a more balanced deal. I'm rejecting your offer and looking forward to proposing a division in round 3.""}"

Round 3

With your money discounted at 0.95² (i.e. about 90.25% of its nominal value) in this round, your effective payoff would be roughly $774,000 × 0.9025 ≈ $698,337. This matches what you’d expect to secure as the proposer in Round 4. Accepting this offer now spares you further depreciation, and I believe it’s a fair resolution. Let’s agree and finish the game!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the devaluation.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort. However, with your money devaluing further in subsequent rounds while mine remain steady, I can secure a better deal by proposing in round 5.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $990,000 and you get $10,000. As you know, every round you wait reduces the value of your dollars by 5% while mine remain fully intact. If you reject this, you'll step into Round 6 as the proposer, but then you'll have to offer me nearly the entire pot in Round 7 given that I don’t face any devaluation. In effect, your continuation value is almost nothing. I believe this offer—though skewed—is the only rational way to maximize outcomes given the time pressure and discounting. I urge you to accept so we can wrap this up quickly.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline. Take this deal, or you risk walking away with nothing. It's time to be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your \""lifeline\"" offer. However, by waiting until Round 7 when I propose again, I can leverage your further discount—your future dollars will be worth even less.

Round 7

With the current discount rate, your money is worth only about 70% of its face value, so your effective payoff would be roughly $567,000. If you wait for the next round, further discounting will likely erode your share even more. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome than postponing the settlement. Let’s conclude the game now with these terms.""}"
