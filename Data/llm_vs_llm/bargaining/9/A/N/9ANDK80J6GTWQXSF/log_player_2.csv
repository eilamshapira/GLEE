"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so that you receive $735092 and I keep $264908. Given that waiting would discount your future dollars by 5% per round, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect in a later round. I believe it’s a fair, time‐sensitive split. Let’s agree and finish the game! 
# Bob gain: 735092 
# Alice gain: 264908 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 610000,
""alice_gain"": 390000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion. Accepting now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose we settle now: I take $226000 and you get $774000. With your money discounted at 0.95² (i.e. about 90.25% of its nominal value) in this round, your effective payoff would be roughly $774000 × 0.9025 ≈ $698337. This matches what you’d expect to secure as the proposer in Round 4. Accepting this offer now spares you further depreciation, and I believe it’s a fair resolution. Let’s agree and finish the game! 
# Bob gain: 774000 
# Alice gain: 226000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I would consider fair, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the devaluation.  Let's wrap this up.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $990000 and you get $10000. As you know, every round you wait reduces the value of your dollars by 5% while mine remain fully intact. If you reject this, you'll step into Round 6 as the proposer, but then you'll have to offer me nearly the entire pot in Round 7 given that I don’t face any devaluation. In effect, your continuation value is almost nothing. I believe this offer—though skewed—is the only rational way to maximize outcomes given the time pressure and discounting. I urge you to accept so we can wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is absurd!  While I understand the pressure of the devaluation, I refuse to be bullied into accepting a practically worthless offer.  I'm hoping Alice will come to her senses and make a reasonable proposal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline. Take this deal, or you risk walking away with nothing. It's time to be realistic."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 7 I’m offering you $810000 while I take $190000. With the current discount rate, your money is worth only about 70% of its face value, so your effective payoff would be roughly $567000. If you wait for the next round, further discounting will likely erode your share even more. I believe this offer gives you a better outcome than postponing the settlement. Let’s conclude the game now with these terms. 
# Bob gain: 810000 
# Alice gain: 190000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is much more reasonable than her previous one, and waiting any longer significantly risks getting even less.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a decent payout."
