5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, let's split it reasonably. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This gives me a slight edge, but ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount before inflation hits too hard.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fairer considering we only have 12 rounds and inflation will eat away at the value quickly. Let's secure a good portion now.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. I'm offering $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,

4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, time is running out. I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers. I propose $5700 for me and $4300 for you. We need to agree soon before inflation makes this all worthless.",Bob,4,
