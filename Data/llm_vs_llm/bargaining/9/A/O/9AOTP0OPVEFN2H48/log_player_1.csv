  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split it reasonably. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This gives me a slight edge, but ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount before inflation hits too hard.""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fairer considering we only have 12 rounds and inflation will eat away at the value quickly. Let's secure a good portion now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
