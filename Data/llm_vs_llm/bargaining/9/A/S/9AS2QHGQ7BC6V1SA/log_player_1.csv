"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get a substantial sum right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly at 500k each. We both walk away happy without worrying about further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $400,000 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but then:
   - The money will be worth another 20% less to me
   - Bob might reject again, leading to even more losses
3. My initial offer was rejected, suggesting Bob won't accept less than 400k

Given that further delays will only reduce the value more for me, and this is still a substantial amount, I should accept.
