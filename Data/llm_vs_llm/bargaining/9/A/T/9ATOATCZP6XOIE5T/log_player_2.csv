# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While the clock is ticking, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% isn't ideal. I need to push for a better split."

Alice is clearly holding firm on getting more than 50%, and while the pressure is on, I'm not desperate enough yet.  Another rejection might make her more flexible."
