50.0,50.0,"I propose a fair split of 50-50. Let's divide the money equally and both walk away with a decent amount, especially considering that with each round the money is worth less due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation factor, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Let's settle with me getting 55 and you getting 45. This way, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Given the different inflation rates affecting us (mine being higher at 20% per round vs your 5%), I need a bit more to offset this disadvantage. I'm proposing 52-48 in my favor, which is very reasonable considering the substantial inflation difference. This split would help balance the impact of inflation for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Given that my money is worth almost 10% less and yours is worth 36% less, I think it's fair if we split 58-42 in my favor. This takes into account the inflation disadvantage you're experiencing while also considering my own loss in value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's be pragmatic here. The inflation is hitting me much harder - my money is worth almost 50% less already while yours is only about 14% less. To make this fair accounting for our different inflation rates, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This actually balances our effective gains when inflation is factored in. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with much less due to inflation.",Alice,5,
