I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will accept.  I figure I can get away with this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing. My share is significantly lower, but it's still a decent amount.  I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob's side, but it seems he's willing to split it evenly. I'm happy to take that."
