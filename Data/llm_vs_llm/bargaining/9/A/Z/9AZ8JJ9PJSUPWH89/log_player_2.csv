"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is not a fair offer. Alice is proposing to take 90% of the money while I only get 10%. Given that there's inflation on my end, I should try to secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This gives us equal shares of the money, and considering I face 5% inflation with each round, it makes sense to establish a fair division now rather than prolonging negotiations."
