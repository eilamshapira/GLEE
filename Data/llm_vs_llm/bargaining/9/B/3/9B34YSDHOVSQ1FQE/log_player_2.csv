"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't exactly an equal split, it's a reasonable starting offer. However, since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to make a counter-offer to try getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I propose this split as it's close to a fair division while still giving Alice a small advantage. This should be more appealing than a strict 50-50 split while being more favorable to me than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation. Alice has increased her offer to me from 4000$ to 4200$, but due to inflation, her portion (5800$) is actually worth significantly less to her (about 3712$ after 36% inflation). Since I'm not affected by inflation, my 4200$ maintains its full value. This is actually a better offer for me than the first round, and the inflation pressure on Alice might make future negotiations more difficult for her.
