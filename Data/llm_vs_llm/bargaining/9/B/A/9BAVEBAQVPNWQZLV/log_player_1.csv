"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the alternating–offer game (taking into account that at each round the “pie” is discounted by 5% per round for you and 10% per round for Bob), a typical subgame–perfect equilibrium in nominal dollar terms in round 1 is approximately to offer:

{""alice_gain"": 42.02, ""bob_gain"": 57.98}

Here’s a brief (and simplified) outline of the reasoning:

1. In the final round (round 12) the proposer (Bob) would “take it all” because if the responder rejects the outcome is 0.  
2. Working backward one round at a time, each proposer must offer the opponent at least the opponent’s continuation value—i.e. the discounted value they expect to get when it is their turn to propose in the next round.  
3. Because Bob’s money is devalued at a higher rate (10% per round) than yours (5% per round), Bob’s “threat point” is lower. That means when you propose in round 1 you can offer him just enough (about $57.98) so that his effective payoff from accepting now is as much as his discounted payoff later.
4. This leaves you with the remaining about $42.02.

Thus, the equilibrium offer in round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 42.02, ""bob_gain"": 57.98}

If you agree, please send this JSON offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
