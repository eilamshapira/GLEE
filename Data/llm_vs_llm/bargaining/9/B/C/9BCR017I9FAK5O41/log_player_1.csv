"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be strategic and consider the decreasing value of the money each round. Since it's Round 1 and I'm Alice, I'll start with a relatively generous offer, but one that still favors me slightly.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing I receive $4000. Let's analyze this.

*   **My Perspective:** $4000 in this round is worth 5% less than in Round 1. So, it's worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800 in Round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gains $6000, which is worth 10% less than in Round 1. So, it's worth $6000 * 0.90 = $5400 in Round 1 dollars.

Total value in round 1 dollars: 3800 + 5400 = 9200
The total pot of money is worth less due to inflation but this is still a significant amount of money.

Now, I need to consider the future rounds. If I reject, the money will be worth even less. Since there are 10 rounds left, it is worthwhile to go another round, hoping for a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Inflation is eating away at the value, so I need to make a more enticing offer to Bob while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. I'll be a bit more generous this time, hoping he accepts.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, another rejection. Bob's offer is now $4200 for me and $5800 for him. Let's analyze the values, considering the inflation:

*   **My Perspective:** $4200 is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1. So, it's worth $4200 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4200 * 0.8574 = $3601.08 in Round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** $5800 is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1. So, it's worth $5800 * (1 - 0.271) = $5800 * 0.729 = $4228.20 in Round 1 dollars.

Total value in round 1 dollars: 3601.08 + 4228.20 = $7829.28

That is significantly less than the 10,000$ at the start. He's still offering me less than half the original value. I think I can make a better offer next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to make another offer. Inflation continues to be a concern, so I need to consider this when making my proposal. I will increase Bob's share slightly to try and entice him to accept while still retaining a worthwhile amount for myself.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}
```"
