5177.0,4823.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I'll take $5177 and you'll get $4823. This split reflects our best‐case outcomes if we both play optimally in the remaining rounds, accounting for the 20% per round devaluation. Accepting now avoids further loss of value. Let’s settle now and move forward!",Alice,1,
