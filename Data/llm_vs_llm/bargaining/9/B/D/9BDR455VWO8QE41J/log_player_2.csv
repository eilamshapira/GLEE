Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I'll take $5177 and you'll get $4823. This split reflects our best‐case outcomes if we both play optimally in the remaining rounds, accounting for the 20% per round devaluation. Accepting now avoids further loss of value. Let’s settle now and move forward! 
# Bob gain: 4823 
# Alice gain: 5177
