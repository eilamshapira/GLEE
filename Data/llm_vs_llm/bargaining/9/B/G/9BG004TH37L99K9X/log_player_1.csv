"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risks of inflation reducing our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since money is worth 10% less to me now, $5000 is actually worth $4500 to me. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that might get me more, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. With inflation affecting both of us, this is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose more value due to inflation.""}"
