Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. With inflation affecting both of us, this is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose more value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
