"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair on the surface
2. However, due to 5% inflation per round, if I reject now and propose in the next round:
   * The $50 would be worth $47.50 to me in the next round
   * I could propose a higher amount to compensate for this loss
3. There's risk in rejecting:
   * Alice might reject my next proposal
   * Further rounds mean more value loss
4. 50-50 is a standard fair split that often leads to agreement

Given that inflation will eat into my gains in future rounds and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer, I think it's rational to accept this fair split now.
