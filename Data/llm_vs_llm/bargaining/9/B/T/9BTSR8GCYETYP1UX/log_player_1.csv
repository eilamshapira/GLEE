"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation risk. This offer gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning: While this split gives Bob slightly more than me (52.5% vs 47.5%), accepting now is better than risking further inflation. If I reject, my next offer would be worth 10% less to me, and if negotiations continue, the value keeps decreasing. This is a reasonable compromise, and the difference between our shares isn't large enough to justify the inflation risk."
