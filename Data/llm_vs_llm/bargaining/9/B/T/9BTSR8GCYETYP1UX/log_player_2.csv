Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a 50-50 split, but to account for the potential risk and uncertainty, I'll slightly favor myself.
