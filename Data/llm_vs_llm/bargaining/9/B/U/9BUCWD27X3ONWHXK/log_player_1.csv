"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since there are 12 rounds total and I face 5% inflation per round, I should be strategic with my initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still generous enough that Bob might accept it rather than waiting for future rounds when inflation will reduce the value of my share."
