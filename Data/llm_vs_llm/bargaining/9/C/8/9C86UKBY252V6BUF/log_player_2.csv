"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair offer, a little more for me since I'm proposing. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a competitive offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more reasonable, don't let it slip away!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it! Inflation is eating away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my effective gain would be approximately 400000 * 0.81 = 324000. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (10% less each round, so 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81, and now another 10% less, which is 0.9 * 0.81 = 0.729), I'll make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Last chance, inflation is killing me, be reasonable!""}"
