"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. While not perfectly equal, it's close to fair and offers you a substantial amount. If you reject, we'll both lose money due to the 5% inflation, so I believe this is a reasonable first offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of 45% to me and 55% to her.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will decrease by 5% due to inflation (so we'd have 95$ to split instead of 100$).

Alice's offer gives me $45 right now, which is less than half but still a substantial amount. If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, even if I propose a more favorable split for myself, we'll be working with less money overall.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that Alice's initial offer is reasonably fair (not too far from 50-50), accepting now seems rational.
