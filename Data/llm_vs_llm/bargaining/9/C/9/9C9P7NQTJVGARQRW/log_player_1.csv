"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3

``` 

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and making an offer Bob might accept.  I'm hoping he sees the trend and realizes accepting sooner than later is in his best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is clearly exploitative. Bob is likely hoping I'll panic due to inflation and accept any offer. However, I'm more willing to risk getting nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

It seems like Bob is determined to play unfairly. It's time to significantly reduce my ask in hopes of getting something.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the inflation working against me, is better than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 41 
# Bob gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although far from ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get from Bob.  The inflation is eating into my potential gains with every passing round. Accepting this offer ensures I at least receive something."
