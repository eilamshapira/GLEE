"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll both lose 20% of the value in the next round. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more equitable 55-45 split. We both win! I'm giving you a good chunk, more than you'll likely get later considering the increasing penalties. Let's secure a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
- I get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
- Bob gets $5500 at full value

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 20% less
- After several more rounds of rejection, the value will decrease significantly
- There's risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12

The offer isn't great for me, but with inflation eating into my share each round, and the risk of getting nothing if we drag this out too long, it might be better to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
