5173.73,4826.27,"Hi Bob, as the proposer in Round 1 I’d like to settle things immediately – time is money (at least for me!). Considering that waiting further will cost me 20% value each round, I propose we split the $10000 as $5173.73 for me and $4826.27 for you. I believe this reflects the strategic balance: if you reject and go to Round 2, you’d be in a more advantageous position while I suffer a discount. Accepting now gives you a solid amount without delay. Looking forward to an agreement!",Alice,1,
