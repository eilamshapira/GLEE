"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5173.73, ""bob_gain"": 4826.27, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as the proposer in Round 1 I’d like to settle things immediately – time is money (at least for me!). Considering that waiting further will cost me 20% value each round, I propose we split the $10,000 as $5,173.73 for me and $4,826.27 for you. I believe this reflects the strategic balance: if you reject and go to Round 2, you’d be in a more advantageous position while I suffer a discount. Accepting now gives you a solid amount without delay. Looking forward to an agreement!""}"
