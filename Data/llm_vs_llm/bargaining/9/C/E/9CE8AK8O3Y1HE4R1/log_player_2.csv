"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as the proposer in Round 1 I’d like to settle things immediately – time is money (at least for me!). Considering that waiting further will cost me 20% value each round, I propose we split the $10000 as $5173.73 for me and $4826.27 for you. I believe this reflects the strategic balance: if you reject and go to Round 2, you’d be in a more advantageous position while I suffer a discount. Accepting now gives you a solid amount without delay. Looking forward to an agreement! 
# Bob gain: 4826.27 
# Alice gain: 5173.73 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice claims she loses 20% per round, while I know I lose 5% per round due to inflation. This first offer gives me $4,826.27.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, my money would be worth 5% less, but I could potentially ask for more. However, Alice seems motivated to settle quickly due to her higher inflation rate.

This initial offer is close to a 50-50 split and gives me a substantial portion. Since the inflation penalty increases with each round, and there's risk in prolonged negotiations, this appears to be a reasonable offer.
