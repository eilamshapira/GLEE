"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that with each round, the money is worth less for both of us (10% less for me and 20% less for Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,500, which is close to half. This is a fair offer considering that if you reject, the total value drops for both of us, but more dramatically for you (20% vs my 10%). Let's settle now and both walk away with substantial value.""}"
