"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split that benefits us both.  Let's wrap this up quickly! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $30 for me, $70 for Alice
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The total value decreases
   * For me: 5% less (I could offer from $95)
   * For Alice: 20% less (her next potential gain would be worth much less)
3. Alice's significant 20% penalty per round gives me leverage
4. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer

This initial split is too favorable to Alice, and given her higher inflation penalty, I have a stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering our different inflation penalties:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses 20% value each round while mine only loses 5%, this is actually a favorable deal for you. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth significantly less. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation, but your offer was too low. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $35 for me, $65 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $35 is actually worth $31.61 (35 * 0.9025)
   * Alice's $65 is worth only $41.60 (65 * 0.64)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round inflation will be even worse
   * My penalty will be ~15% total
   * Alice's penalty will be ~49% total
4. Alice's offer is still not great, but:
   * The absolute value keeps decreasing
   * The real value gap between us is smaller than it appears
   * Further negotiation might leave us both worse off

Given the significant inflation impact and that we're already in round 3, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further value deterioration.
