Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your concerns regarding inflation. In light of that and to avoid further erosion of our gains, I'm proposing a division that slightly favors me. I believe this deal is fair given the current uncertainties and our mutual interest in securing as much value as possible. Let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
