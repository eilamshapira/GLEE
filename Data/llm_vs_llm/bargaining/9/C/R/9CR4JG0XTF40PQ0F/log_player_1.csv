"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is close to an even split but gives me a small buffer against the 10% inflation penalty if Bob rejects and we go to another round. I think this is fair and should be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 split:
   * I get $5,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4,500 to me
   * Bob gets $5,000 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 20% less
   * I could propose again, but Bob might reject again
   * Further delays mean even more value loss for me

While the split isn't ideal given the inflation affecting me, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
