"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the information, in round 2:

*   My money is worth 80% of its original value.
*   Bob's money is worth 95% of its original value.

Considering the offers:

*   **My share:** $350,000
*   **Effective value to me:** $350,000 * 0.80 = $280,000
*   **Bob's share:** $650,000
*   **Effective value to Bob:** $650,000 * 0.95 = $617,500

Given that I can't negotiate further and considering inflation, I should **reject** this offer.
I'd have to get a better offer in the subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3. Remember, the money is worth less to me now due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
