"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's better than the last offer and still ensures you receive a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
* Even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would be worth $48 after the 20% inflation
* Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $40.5 to me) is likely better than what I could achieve in future rounds due to increasing inflation
