"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is now $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. However, to make the offer clear, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base for the division, but keep in mind the actual value to me is reduced.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly more in your favor 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value, I need to think about the actual worth to me. Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round for me, I'll calculate the effective value of Alice's offer.

Effective value for me = 420,000 * (1 - 0.36) = 420,000 * 0.64 = 268,800

Given this significant reduction in value and the fact that we're only in round 3, I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, and we are in round 4, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

For me, the effective total amount considering the 36% reduction is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.19) = $810,000. However, to make the division clear, I'll use the original $1,000,000 as the base.

Given the decreasing value, I'll aim for a split that reflects the remaining value and tries to find a middle ground.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Considering the loss, let's find a mutually beneficial split""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, considering the increasing loss 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant decrease in value for me (59.04% less) and considering we're halfway through the rounds, I need to reassess the offer carefully.

The effective value of Alice's offer for me would be:
440,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 440,000 * 0.4096 = 180,224

This is a substantial reduction from the original value. However, considering the alternative of potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, and given that Alice's offer is somewhat closer to a middle ground, I might need to reconsider my strategy to ensure I get some value.
