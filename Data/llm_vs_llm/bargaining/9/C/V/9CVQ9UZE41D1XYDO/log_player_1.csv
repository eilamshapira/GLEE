"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid further delays that might reduce the value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $400,000 to me (500000 * 0.8).

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor, as I would be giving up more value than I'm receiving.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each passing round, and we're now in Round 3, the value of the money I receive will be reduced by 20% twice: 

$1,000,000 * 0.8 (Round 1) = $800,000
$800,000 * 0.8 (Round 2) = $640,000

So, for Round 3, the money I gain will be worth 40% less than the original value (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36, or approximately 40% less, but to simplify, 1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 640,000, then 1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 512,000 for the third round,  1,000,000 - 512,000 = 488,000 for Bob).

I'll make an offer that takes this into account:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's settle this before it's too late!""
}
```

This offer gives me $512,000, which is worth the original value to me after accounting for inflation, and gives Bob $488,000."
