"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   - Money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth 900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000
   - But Alice might reject that
   - We'd risk further inflation

$400,000 is a significant amount, but 40/60 split feels a bit unfair when we're starting fresh. Given that I have the power to make the next offer and Alice doesn't know how inflation affects me, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while considering that Alice might reject and lead to Round 3, where the money would be worth even less to me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid further delays that might reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 488000 
# Alice gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $488,000, but worth 19% less due to inflation
   - Real value to me: $488,000 * 0.81 = $395,280

2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - Money will be worth 29% less to me (additional 10%)
   - Any future gains would be significantly reduced
   - The negotiation could drag on, making things worse

This is actually a pretty fair offer from Alice (close to 50-50), and considering the inflation impact, the real value I'm getting is similar to her first offer but with a more equitable split. Further negotiation would likely lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to compounding inflation.
