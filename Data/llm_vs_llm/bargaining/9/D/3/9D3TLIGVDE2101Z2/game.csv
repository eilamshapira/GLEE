80.0,20.0,"Hi Alice, I know you might consider holding out for your turn, but remember that every round's delay cuts your dollary value by 20%. In round 3 you’d only effectively secure about $64 if you waited, whereas with this offer you get $80 nominally (worth 0.8 * $80 = $64 effective), matching your continuation value. I believe this is as fair as it gets given the discounting—please accept!",Bob,2,
