Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know you might consider holding out for your turn, but remember that every round's delay cuts your dollary value by 20%. In round 3 you’d only effectively secure about $64 if you waited, whereas with this offer you get $80 nominally (worth 0.8 * $80 = $64 effective), matching your continuation value. I believe this is as fair as it gets given the discounting—please accept! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
