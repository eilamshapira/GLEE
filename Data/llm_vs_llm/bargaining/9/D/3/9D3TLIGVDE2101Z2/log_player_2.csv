"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'll take $60 and you get $40. That's a fairly good split to start with! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 20, ""alice_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I know you might consider holding out for your turn, but remember that every round's delay cuts your dollary value by 20%. In round 3 you’d only effectively secure about $64 if you waited, whereas with this offer you get $80 nominally (worth 0.8 * $80 = $64 effective), matching your continuation value. I believe this is as fair as it gets given the discounting—please accept!""}"
