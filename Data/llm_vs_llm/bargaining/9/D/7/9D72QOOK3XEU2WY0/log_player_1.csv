"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to my 5% loss, he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable considering Bob's higher inflation rate, but still gives him a substantial sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offering me 450,000$, which due to 5% inflation is worth 427,500$ to me
2. If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's portion has already lost 20% value for him, so his 550,000$ is worth 440,000$ to him
4. He's trying to get more nominal dollars to compensate for his higher inflation rate

While I'd prefer a better split, this is actually a reasonable offer given the inflation dynamics. If I reject, we risk further devaluation for both of us, and my negotiating position isn't necessarily going to improve since Bob's higher inflation rate makes him more desperate in later rounds.
