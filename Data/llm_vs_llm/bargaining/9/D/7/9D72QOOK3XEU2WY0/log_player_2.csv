"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. Remembering the inflation and the fact that I rejected a 40% offer from Alice, I need to make an offer that is better for me, but still acceptable for her. I'll try to get a bit more than half, considering the declining value of the money.
