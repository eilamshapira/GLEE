"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine maintains its value, I have an advantage in negotiation by waiting. 

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- For Alice, her portion would be worth 10% less
- 6000$ would only be worth 5400$ to her in the next round
- This gives me leverage to negotiate a better deal

Therefore, I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, she should be more willing to accept a less favorable deal now. If she rejects my offer, her money will be worth even less in the next round.

In round 1, she offered me 4000$. Now that her money is worth 10% less, I can propose a split more in my favor, and it might still be rational for her to accept.

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable offer because:
1. For Alice, 4000$ now is worth more than 6000$ in the next round (which would be worth 5400$ to her)
2. If she rejects, we'll go to round 3 where her money will be worth even less
3. It's a significant improvement for me compared to her initial offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For Alice, the 5500$ is actually worth only 4455$ (due to 19% inflation)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - Her inflation will increase to 27.1% (another 10% drop)
   - 5500$ would be worth even less to her then
   - This gives me more negotiating power

3. The offer of 4500$ to me is only a small improvement from her initial offer of 4000$
4. Given my stronger negotiating position (due to no inflation on my side), I can likely get a better deal

Therefore, I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice's money has lost 27.1% of its value (after 3 rounds of 10% decline)
2. My money maintains its full value
3. If Alice rejects this offer, her money will lose another 10% value in the next round
4. Alice has shown some flexibility by increasing my share from 4000$ to 4500$

I'll propose a more aggressive split in my favor, as it's becoming increasingly costly for Alice to continue negotiating:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This offer makes sense because:
1. For Alice, 3000$ now is worth more than a larger sum in the next round due to continued inflation
2. My position is getting stronger each round due to the asymmetric inflation
3. It's rational for Alice to accept this rather than face further devaluation of her share"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. For Alice, her 5000$ is actually only worth 3280.50$ (due to 34.39% inflation)
2. She's gradually increasing my share (4000 -> 4500 -> 5000)
3. If I reject:
   - Her inflation will increase to about 41% in the next round
   - Her money will be worth even less
   - However, we're getting to a point where continued negotiation might be counterproductive

4. While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's also a risk of:
   - Prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily
   - Alice potentially becoming less cooperative
   - Diminishing returns from further rounds

Given that she's now offering a fair 50-50 split, and considering the number of rounds we've already gone through, I'll accept this offer.
