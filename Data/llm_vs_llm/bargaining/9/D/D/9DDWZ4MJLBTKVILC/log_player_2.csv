"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that she gets 60% ($600,000) and I get 40% ($400,000) of the million dollars.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

Even if I could get a larger percentage in the next round, the total value to me would be diminished. For example, if I somehow got 50% in the next round, that would be $500,000, but worth only $400,000 to me after inflation.

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is the same as getting 50% in the next round after inflation. Since there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept a counter-offer, and the money will continue to lose value with each round, I should accept this offer.
