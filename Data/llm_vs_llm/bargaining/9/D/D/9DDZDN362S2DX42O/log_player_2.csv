"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair right from the start and split it evenly. 500k each sounds great for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, I'll face 5% inflation in the next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. 500,000$ now is better than a potentially larger sum that's worth less due to inflation
5. There's also the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

This is actually a good first offer. With inflation eating into future values, taking a fair split now is better than risking lower real value later.
