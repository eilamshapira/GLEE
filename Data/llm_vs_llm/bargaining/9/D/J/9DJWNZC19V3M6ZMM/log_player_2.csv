"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer that benefits both of us. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering we only have 12 rounds and inflation will devalue the money. This ensures we both get a significant amount before the value decreases further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation. If I reject this offer, I'll lose some value but might be able to propose a more favorable split.

Let me evaluate: I'm offered $40 now. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less to me.
