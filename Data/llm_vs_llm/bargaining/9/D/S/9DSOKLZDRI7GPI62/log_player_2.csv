"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% each round
3. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. But my $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 (in Round 1 terms) in the next round
5. Even if I try to ask for more in Round 2, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss

Given that:
- The current offer is fair
- Inflation will definitely hurt my position if I reject
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- Further rounds would only decrease the real value of my share
