"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I take a bit more to start since the value goes down quickly with each round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's suggesting I take $40 while she takes $60. She's justifying taking more because of the inflation effect, but I should remember that with each round, the money becomes worth 20% less to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 20%. So the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round.

Alice's current offer gives me $40, which is less than half but still significant. If I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it, and we'd lose another 20% value.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, I think it's reasonable to accept this first offer rather than risk further devaluation.
