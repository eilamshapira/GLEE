"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $60 and I get $40. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, waiting will reduce the value of my share. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the 5% inflation will impact whatever I receive.

Let me calculate: If I reject, in the next round the money would be worth 5% less to me, so $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. If I propose a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 but it would be worth $47.50 to me due to inflation.

Since $40 now is better than potentially getting less later due to inflation, and given we have limited rounds, I should accept this initial offer.
