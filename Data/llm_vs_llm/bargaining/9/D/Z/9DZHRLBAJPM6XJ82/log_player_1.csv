"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 60/40 â€“ I take $6,000 and you get $4,000. Given that waiting costs us both (especially me with a 20% depreciation per round), accepting this fair division now maximizes our combined value. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Given the inflation rates, a 50/50 split seems more fair. This way, neither of us is at a significant disadvantage. Let's both get $5000. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
