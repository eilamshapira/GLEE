"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 60/40 â€“ I take $6000 and you get $4000. Given that waiting costs us both (especially me with a 20% depreciation per round), accepting this fair division now maximizes our combined value. Looking forward to your response!

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the inflation rates, I think a 50/50 split is more fair. Let's both get $5000."
