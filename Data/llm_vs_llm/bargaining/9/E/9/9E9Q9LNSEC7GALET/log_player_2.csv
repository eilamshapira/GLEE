"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a fair split of 50-50. This way we both get an equal share. With inflation affecting my earnings by 10% each round, it's best for both of us to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. My $50 will be worth $47.50 next round due to 5% inflation
3. If I make a counter-offer, I could try to get more, but:
   - Alice might reject, leading to further inflation losses
   - We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds
   - A fair split encourages cooperation

Given that inflation will eat into my earnings if we delay, and 50-50 is a reasonable split, I'll accept this offer.
