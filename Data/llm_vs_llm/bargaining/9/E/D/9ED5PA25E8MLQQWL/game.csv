475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I need to account for it on my side as well. This offer gives you a fair share while considering my inflation risk.",Bob,2,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, considering I'm losing 5% value each round, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This split is still favorable for you, and we should agree soon to avoid further value loss for both of us.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I need to ensure I'm covered for the inflation risk too. Let's settle this soon so neither of us loses more value.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're both losing value as time passes. I need a larger share because I'm definitely losing 5% each round - I'm now at over 14% loss in value. This offer gives you 400k now, which is better than continuing to negotiate while our money loses value. Let's conclude this deal.",Alice,5,
