"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the inflation risk I'm facing. This is a good deal for both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I need to account for it on my side as well. This offer gives you a fair share while considering my inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): The money is already worth 5% less to me, so $475,000 is effectively worth $451,250. I can make a counter-offer and try to get a better deal, especially since I know my inflation rate but am uncertain about Bob's."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Bob, considering I'm losing 5% value each round, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This split is still favorable for you, and we should agree soon to avoid further value loss for both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I need to ensure I'm covered for the inflation risk too. Let's settle this soon so neither of us loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 14.26% inflation, $450,000 would be worth only about $385,830 to me. This is significantly lower than what I could potentially get by making another counter-offer, even accounting for future inflation. We still have several rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing value as time passes. I need a larger share because I'm definitely losing 5% each round - I'm now at over 14% loss in value. This offer gives you 400k now, which is better than continuing to negotiate while our money loses value. Let's conclude this deal.""
