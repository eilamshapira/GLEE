"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that I believe is fair, considering the presence of inflation that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This gives you a substantial portion while protecting me from potential future devaluation if we need additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see we're both looking for a fair division. Let me adjust my offer to find a better middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is a fair compromise between our previous positions, and I'm willing to accept this despite the inflation effect on my portion. A fair split now is better than continuing negotiations while my value decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see we're still working to find common ground. The inflation penalty is becoming more significant for me, so let me adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""bob_gain"": 525000}

I'm proposing a 47.5-52.5 split, which gives Bob a bit more than half while still allowing me to receive a fair portion considering the inflation effect. This is a compromise from my previous equal split offer, acknowledging Bob's desire for a larger share while protecting my interests as inflation continues to impact my portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
