"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose you take 5500$ while I take 4500$. This seems like a fair way to start off and ensures you get a little more! What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $5,500 while she gets $4,500 out of the total $10,000.

I need to consider that if I reject this offer, I'll have the chance to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round.

This current offer gives me 55% of the total amount, which is more than half. If I reject and go to the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $5,500 to offset the 20% inflation penalty.

This is a reasonable first offer that favors me slightly, so I'll accept.
