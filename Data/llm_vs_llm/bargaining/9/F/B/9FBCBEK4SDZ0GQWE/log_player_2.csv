"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. I need to consider if I should accept this or reject and make a counter-offer.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. So the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round. Since Alice faces a steeper depreciation, she has more incentive to settle quickly.

I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round compared to my 10%, I'll offer a split that's more favorable to me but still appealing enough for Alice to accept rather than going to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering this split because if Alice rejects, in the next round the total would be worth only 80% of the current value to her. This gives her an incentive to accept now rather than risk getting an even smaller portion in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

In Round 3, due to inflation:
- For me (Bob): Money is worth 19% less than Round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 36% less than Round 1

Alice is offering me $420,000 out of $1,000,000. 

If I reject and we go to Round 4:
- My inflation will increase to 27.1% (another 10% reduction)
- Alice's inflation will increase to 48.8% (another 20% reduction)

The $420,000 Alice is offering me now is actually better than her first offer of $400,000, and considering the increasing inflation penalty, it makes sense to accept rather than risk further devaluation of our shares.
