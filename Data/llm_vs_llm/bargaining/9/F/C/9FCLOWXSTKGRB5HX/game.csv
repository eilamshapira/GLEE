60.0,40.0,"Let's make a fair split considering the 5% devaluation you face each round. I get 60, you get 40, and we both walk away happy without risking further devaluation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"I propose a 50/50 split. My money is losing value each round, so let's end this now and both walk away with a fair share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Consider that in just two rounds, your share has already lost about 10% of its value. A 65-35 split now is better for you than risking further rounds where your money keeps losing value. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alright, let's try this again. I'm offering a slightly better split for me this time (45/55). Continuing will only hurt my share further due to inflation. Let's end this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Your money has already lost over 14% of its value, and it will keep decreasing by 5% each round. A 70-30 split now is actually better for you than waiting more rounds where your share will be worth even less. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
60.0,40.0,"Okay, let's try this again. I'll take 40, you get 60. This is the best I can offer and still try to get a decent amount before my money loses more value. Let's finalize this.",Bob,6,
