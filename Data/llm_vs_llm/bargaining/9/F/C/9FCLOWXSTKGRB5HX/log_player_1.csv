"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the 5% devaluation you face each round. I get 60, you get 40, and we both walk away happy without risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. My money is losing value each round, so let's end this now and both walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given that Bob faces 5% inflation per round and I don't, I can get a better deal. By rejecting this, I can make another offer that takes advantage of the inflation factor. Bob should be more willing to accept a less favorable split next round since their money will be worth even less then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Consider that in just two rounds, your share has already lost about 10% of its value. A 65-35 split now is better for you than risking further rounds where your money keeps losing value. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alright, let's try this again. I'm offering a slightly better split for me this time (45/55). Continuing will only hurt my share further due to inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since Bob's money continues to devalue at 5% per round and mine doesn't, I still have leverage. The inflation impact is becoming significant for Bob (over 14% already), which means they should be increasingly willing to accept a less favorable split as we continue. I can offer a better split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Your money has already lost over 14% of its value, and it will keep decreasing by 5% each round. A 70-30 split now is actually better for you than waiting more rounds where your share will be worth even less. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'll take 40, you get 60. This is the best I can offer and still try to get a decent amount before my money loses more value. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer for several reasons:
1. Bob has shown they're willing to be stubborn despite the inflation penalty
2. This is actually the same split I originally proposed in round 1
3. With Bob's money already worth 22.62% less, their actual value received is significantly reduced
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we go all 12 rounds without agreement
5. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good advantage while still ending the negotiation"
