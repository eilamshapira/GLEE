Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider that in just two rounds, your share has already lost about 10% of its value. A 65-35 split now is better for you than risking further rounds where your money keeps losing value. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
