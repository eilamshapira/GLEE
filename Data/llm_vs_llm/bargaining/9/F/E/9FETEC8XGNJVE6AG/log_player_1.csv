"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly, 50-50. Since there's no inflation for me, and we don't know how inflation affects you, this equal split seems most reasonable. We both walk away with half a million dollars.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split fairly, Alice. However, I'm facing inflation. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This way, I'm covered for potential losses in the next round if you decide to reject. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
