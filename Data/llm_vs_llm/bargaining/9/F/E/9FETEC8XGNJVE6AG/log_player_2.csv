"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, 50-50. Since there's no inflation for me, and we don't know how inflation affects you, this equal split seems most reasonable. We both walk away with half a million dollars. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm not sure about her claim of no inflation. It's a clever tactic to get me to accept a 50/50 split. I'll propose something different in the next round and see how she reacts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want to split fairly, Alice. However, I'm facing inflation. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This way, I'm covered for potential losses in the next round if you decide to reject.""}"
