"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: I propose I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives us both a substantial amount, and accepting now means we avoid inflation losses."
