"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The offer gives me $4,500, which is 45% of the total amount
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $4,500 now is better than $4,750 next round after inflation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
