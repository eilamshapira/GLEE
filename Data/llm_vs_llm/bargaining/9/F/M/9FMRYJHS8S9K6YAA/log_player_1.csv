"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, but considering potential future inflation if Bob rejects it.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and should be acceptable to Bob. If he rejects this, I'll lose 5% value in the next round, so this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept: I get $40 (at 95% value = $38 effective value)
2. If I reject: Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   - Even if I propose a better split next round, it will be worth less
   - And Bob might reject it anyway, leading to more rounds and more value loss

Given that:
- The offer gives me a decent portion (40%)
- Inflation is already affecting my gains
- Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
- We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because the guaranteed $38 effective value now is better than risking further inflation losses in future rounds."
