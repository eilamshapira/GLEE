"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 590000, 
""bob_gain"": 410000}

I propose this division because we both face different inflation costs each round. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs Bob's 5%), it makes sense for me to ask for a larger portion now. This split is fair considering our different time preferences, and it gives both of us substantial amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to reconsider my offer, taking into account both our inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. Since my money loses value at 10% per round compared to Bob's 5%, I still need a somewhat larger portion to maintain fairness. However, I've reduced my requested amount from the first round to show willingness to compromise. This division gives us both substantial portions and prevents further rounds of inflation affecting our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to carefully consider the inflation effects as we're now in round 5, where my money is worth significantly less than in round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. At this point, my inflation penalty is nearly double Bob's (my money loses value at 10% per round versus Bob's 5%). By this round, I've experienced about 34% inflation compared to Bob's 19% inflation. I'm reducing my requested amount further to demonstrate willingness to compromise and avoid additional rounds of inflation affecting both our shares. This division is fair considering our different time preferences and inflation penalties."
