"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money loses 10% of its value for you each round, I'm proposing a split that actually gives you more value than an even split would in the next round. If we go to round 3, the $10000 would only be worth $9000 to you, making this a fair offer that maximizes our combined utility. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
