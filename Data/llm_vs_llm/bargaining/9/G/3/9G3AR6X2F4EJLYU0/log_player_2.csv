"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000. 

Since the money devalues by 10% each round for Alice but remains the same value for me, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. If we go to round 2, Alice would perceive the total as worth only $9,000 to her, while it's still worth $10,000 to me.

This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation effect Alice experiences.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Since the money loses 10% of its value for you each round, I'm proposing a split that actually gives you more value than an even split would in the next round. If we go to round 3, the $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to you, making this a fair offer that maximizes our combined utility.""}"
