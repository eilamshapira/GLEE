"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair, a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, Bob, but time is money! How about a compromise?""
}
``` 

This factors in a slight discount to incentivize Bob to accept due to the inflation affecting my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but time is valuable. This offer accounts for the fact that we're both losing out the longer this goes on. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I need to stop the bleeding! While not ideal, accepting this offer secures me a reasonable sum before inflation eats away too much more. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage, but it's getting too risky."
