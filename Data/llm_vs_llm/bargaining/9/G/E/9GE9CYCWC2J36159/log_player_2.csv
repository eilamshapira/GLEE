"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but how about a 60/40 split in my favor?  This seems fair considering the money loses value with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we're both losing value due to inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. It's a bit more than a 50-50 split to account for the rounds we've gone through, but still fair. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking another round with further inflation. The potential losses outweigh the potential gains at this point."
