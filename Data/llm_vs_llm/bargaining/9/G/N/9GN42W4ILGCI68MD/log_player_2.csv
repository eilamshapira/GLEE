"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $500,000 each. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me. However, I could potentially negotiate a better deal that offsets this loss.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and the first offer is already a 50/50 split, there's significant risk in rejecting. The inflation penalty compounds with each round, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.
