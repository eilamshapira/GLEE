"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I am Bob.

Let's calculate the value for me in this round. Alice is offering me $45. Since it's round 1, there is no inflation yet. So, it's worth $45 to me.

I need to consider that if I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round, and I'll have to make an offer. Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her.

I will accept the offer, it is better than risking the following rounds.
