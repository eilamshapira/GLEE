"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I suggest we split this almost evenly, with me getting $5,200 and you getting $4,800. This is a fair offer that avoids the risk of further rounds where we both lose money due to inflation."
