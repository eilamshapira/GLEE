55.0,45.0,"Bob, I need to account for my inflation penalty. Since my money is now worth 10% less due to 2 rounds of 5% inflation, I need a slightly larger share to achieve fair value. This split gives us approximately equal real value.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's meet in the middle. I'm feeling the inflation pinch too, so this offer helps us both avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, the inflation is now significantly affecting me. After 4 rounds, my money is worth about 19% less than at the start. This 60-40 split helps compensate for that inflation effect, giving us roughly equal real value. Let's agree now before we both lose more value with further delays.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a compromise. This offer acknowledges the inflation impact while still being fair to both of us. We're getting close to the halfway point, so let's settle this now.",Bob,6,
