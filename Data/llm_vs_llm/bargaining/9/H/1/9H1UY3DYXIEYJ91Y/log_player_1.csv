"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will make a fair offer considering the depreciation for Bob.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I will calculate the value of Bob's offer, considering his depreciation, and then decide. Bob is offering me $45 and keeping $55 for himself. Since the value of the money for me is the same as in round 1, I need to compare the discounted value for Bob with what he proposed in the first round. The offer in the first round would have given me $55, and him $45. Let's consider that in that round the worth for both was the same.

Now Bob's money worth 20% less, so the 55$ he proposes are worth only 55*(1-0.2) = 55 * 0.8 = 44$. However, he is giving me only 45$.

I will accept.
