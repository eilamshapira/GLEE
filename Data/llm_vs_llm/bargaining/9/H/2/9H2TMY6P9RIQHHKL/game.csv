8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we end the negotiation now to avoid the harmful effects of inflation. Since waiting costs you more (money depreciates 20% per round for you versus 5% for me), a fair equilibrium outcome would give me about 83.3% of the pie and you about 16.7%. Let's agree: I get $8333 and you get $1667. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

7000.0,3000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your offer was too extreme. I'm willing to accept a higher inflation risk, so I propose I get $3000 and you get $7000. This way, you still get more, but it's a bit fairer to me.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your counter‐offer, but given the inflation impact on your future earnings and the fact that I get hurt less by waiting, I believe we can achieve a more favorable division for me if I propose in the next round. I'm choosing to reject this offer so we can continue negotiating.",Alice,2,reject
8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, thank you for keeping the conversation going. Given that in our alternating‐offer model my discount factor is 0.95 and yours is 0.8 per round, the equilibrium outcome (from round 3 onward) turns out to be roughly 83.3% for me and 16.7% for you in nominal terms. In other words, I propose that I receive $8333 and you get $1667. This split reflects how inflation is working against you more harshly than me, and if we delay further, the pie will only shrink further in effective value. I believe this is the fair and rational division given our positions. I hope you’ll agree to settle now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,3,

7500.0,2500.0,"Alice, I see your point about the equilibrium outcome, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I'm willing to take more risk and propose I get $2500 and you get $7500. This still gives you more, but it's a bit better for me. Let's find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, your current proposal gives me $7500 nominally in round 4—which, after a 14.26% discount, is effectively about $6430. By waiting, I would be the proposer in round 5, where the equilibrium outcome (given my 5% per round discount and your 20% per round discount) would allow me to secure roughly 83.3% of the pie. That would mean around $8333 nominally in round 5, which, after about an 18.55% total discount (0.95^4 ≈ 0.8145), would yield approximately $6787 in effective value. Since $6787 is higher than $6430, I must reject your offer in favor of waiting for a proposal that better reflects the equilibrium division.",Alice,4,reject
8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, now that we’ve reached round 5, waiting any longer will hurt you more due to your steep 20% per round discount (your money is now worth only about 41% of its initial value, compared to my 81% in this round). In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, the balance of our respective discount factors (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you per round) means that the proposer—me in this round—can secure roughly 83.3% of the pie in nominal terms. That works out to $8333 for me and $1667 for you. If you reject, you’d get to propose in round 6, but your expected effective value would hardly improve given your harsher discounting. I believe this division is fair and reflects the true cost of delay under inflation. Let’s settle now to avoid further value loss.",Alice,5,
