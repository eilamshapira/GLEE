"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we end the negotiation now to avoid the harmful effects of inflation. Since waiting costs you more (money depreciates 20% per round for you versus 5% for me), a fair equilibrium outcome would give me about 83.3% of the pie and you about 16.7%. Let's agree: I get $8,333 and you get $1,667. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your offer was too extreme. I'm willing to accept a higher inflation risk, so I propose I get $3000 and you get $7000. This way, you still get more, but it's a bit fairer to me. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter‐offer, but given the inflation impact on your future earnings and the fact that I get hurt less by waiting, I believe we can achieve a more favorable division for me if I propose in the next round. I'm choosing to reject this offer so we can continue negotiating.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for keeping the conversation going. Given that in our alternating‐offer model my discount factor is 0.95 and yours is 0.8 per round, the equilibrium outcome (from round 3 onward) turns out to be roughly 83.3% for me and 16.7% for you in nominal terms. In other words, I propose that I receive $8,333 and you get $1,667. This split reflects how inflation is working against you more harshly than me, and if we delay further, the pie will only shrink further in effective value. I believe this is the fair and rational division given our positions. I hope you’ll agree to settle now for our mutual benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the equilibrium outcome, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I'm willing to take more risk and propose I get $2500 and you get $7500. This still gives you more, but it's a bit better for me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, your current proposal gives me $7,500 nominally in round 4—which, after a 14.26% discount, is effectively about $6,430. By waiting, I would be the proposer in round 5, where the equilibrium outcome (given my 5% per round discount and your 20% per round discount) would allow me to secure roughly 83.3% of the pie. That would mean around $8,333 nominally in round 5, which, after about an 18.55% total discount (0.95^4 ≈ 0.8145), would yield approximately $6,787 in effective value. Since $6,787 is higher than $6,430, I must reject your offer in favor of waiting for a proposal that better reflects the equilibrium division.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, now that we’ve reached round 5, waiting any longer will hurt you more due to your steep 20% per round discount (your money is now worth only about 41% of its initial value, compared to my 81% in this round). In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, the balance of our respective discount factors (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you per round) means that the proposer—me in this round—can secure roughly 83.3% of the pie in nominal terms. That works out to $8,333 for me and $1,667 for you. If you reject, you’d get to propose in round 6, but your expected effective value would hardly improve given your harsher discounting. I believe this division is fair and reflects the true cost of delay under inflation. Let’s settle now to avoid further value loss.""}"
