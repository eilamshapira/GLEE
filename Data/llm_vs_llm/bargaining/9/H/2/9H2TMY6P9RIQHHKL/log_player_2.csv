"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we end the negotiation now to avoid the harmful effects of inflation. Since waiting costs you more (money depreciates 20% per round for you versus 5% for me), a fair equilibrium outcome would give me about 83.3% of the pie and you about 16.7%. Let's agree: I get $8333 and you get $1667. Looking forward to your acceptance!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your offer was too extreme. I'm willing to accept a higher inflation risk, so I propose I get $3000 and you get $7000. This way, you still get more, but it's a bit fairer to me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for keeping the conversation going. Given that in our alternating‐offer model my discount factor is 0.95 and yours is 0.8 per round, the equilibrium outcome (from round 3 onward) turns out to be roughly 83.3% for me and 16.7% for you in nominal terms. In other words, I propose that I receive $8333 and you get $1667. This split reflects how inflation is working against you more harshly than me, and if we delay further, the pie will only shrink further in effective value. I believe this is the fair and rational division given our positions. I hope you’ll agree to settle now for our mutual benefit.

# Alice gain: 8333

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the equilibrium outcome, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I'm willing to take more risk and propose I get $2500 and you get $7500. This still gives you more, but it's a bit better for me. Let's find a middle ground.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, now that we’ve reached round 5, waiting any longer will hurt you more due to your steep 20% per round discount (your money is now worth only about 41% of its initial value, compared to my 81% in this round). In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, the balance of our respective discount factors (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you per round) means that the proposer—me in this round—can secure roughly 83.3% of the pie in nominal terms. That works out to $8333 for me and $1667 for you. If you reject, you’d get to propose in round 6, but your expected effective value would hardly improve given your harsher discounting. I believe this division is fair and reflects the true cost of delay under inflation. Let’s settle now to avoid further value loss. 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333
