500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money equally now. Settling immediately ensures we both avoid any potential inflation losses. Let's secure a fair and prompt agreement so neither of us risks losing value as time passes.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about a quick resolution. How about a slight adjustment?  60/40 split -  it rewards me for taking the initial risk and still gives you a significant sum upfront.",Bob,2,

399000.0,601000.0,"Hi Bob, I know that as we progress, inflation continues to erode the real value of the money you receive (a constant 20% discount relative to round 1, as we’ve seen). In light of that, I want us to settle now rather than see further devaluation. In my proposal, you’d receive 601000 in nominal dollars—which, after the 20% inflation effect, is effectively about 480800 in today's value. I’d get 399000 (full value for me). This offer not only slightly betters your effective outcome compared to what you might secure later by waiting, but it also prevents any additional loss from inflation. Let’s agree on this efficient resolution now.",Alice,3,
