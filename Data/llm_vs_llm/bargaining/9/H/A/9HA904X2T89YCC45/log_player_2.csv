"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually fair - if we go to round 2, your $40 would only be worth $36 to you, so this is a reasonable offer that acknowledges the time pressure you face. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
