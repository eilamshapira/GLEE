"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $400,000 (40%) and keeping $600,000 (60%)
- This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
- I have bargaining power since I can counter-offer
- However, there's risk in rejecting since I don't know Alice's inflation rate
- $400,000 is still a substantial amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, the offer is reasonable enough and guarantees me a good amount without risk. The difference between 40% and 50% may not be worth the risk of negotiation.
