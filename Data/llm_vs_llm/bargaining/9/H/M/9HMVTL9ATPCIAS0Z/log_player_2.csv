"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60 out of the $100. 

If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $100 becomes worth $80 to me). For Alice, it would be 10% less (worth $90 to her).

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and make a better offer next round, I might get more, but the total value has decreased for both of us.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that hurt me more than Alice, and that we only have 12 rounds to reach agreement, I should be cautious about rejecting reasonable offers.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs your 10%), reaching an agreement soon benefits us both, but especially me. This equal split respects our equal roles in the negotiation while acknowledging the time pressure we both face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45, while reducing her share from $60 to $55. This is moving in a better direction.

The inflation penalty is growing - the money is now worth 36% less to me than in round 1, and 19% less to Alice. If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation penalty will increase further.

Let's analyze:
- If I accept now, I get $45 with 36% inflation, so effectively about $28.80
- If I reject, make a better offer, and Alice accepts next round, the inflation would be worse
- We only have 12 rounds total, and we've already used 3
- Each round, my bargaining position weakens more quickly than Alice's due to the asymmetric inflation

Given that Alice made a reasonable concession and the asymmetric inflation hurts me more than her, accepting now is the rational choice.
