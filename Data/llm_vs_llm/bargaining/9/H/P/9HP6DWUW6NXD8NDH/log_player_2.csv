"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, the total amount will decrease by 5% (to $95)
- This first offer is somewhat low, giving Alice a significant advantage (60/40 split)
- I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating, even accounting for the 5% loss

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving a slight advantage to Alice to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}

This is a much fairer split than the previous 60/40. I'm offering Alice $52, which still gives her a small advantage, but is much more equitable. This way, we both get a good portion of the money before inflation reduces its value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
- Alice has improved her offer from 40/60 to 45/55
- We're now in round 3, with 9.75% inflation
- $45 now is worth about $40.61 compared to round 1
- If I reject, we'll go to round 4 with even more inflation
- Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by improving her offer
- While I might get a slightly better deal by continuing, the inflation risk is significant

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward a fairer split, and considering the mounting inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
