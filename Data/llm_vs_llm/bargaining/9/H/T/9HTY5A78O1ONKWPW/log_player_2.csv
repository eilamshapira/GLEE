"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you a substantial 45% share, which is $450000. This way we can both walk away happy without risking value loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice is offering me $450,000 and she's taking $550,000, I think I can do better than that. The game just started, and there's still a lot of value to be had.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to encourage her to accept and avoid further devaluation.

My offer is: 
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and avoid losing more value to inflation. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}"
