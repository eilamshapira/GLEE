Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover, but you still receive a substantial amount. Better to agree now than lose value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be better. Even with this round's 5% inflation, we're both getting close to $5000 each. This is fair and prevents further losses from continued negotiation. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While slightly lower than what I initially proposed, it's still a reasonable split, and rejecting it would mean losing more value to inflation in the next round. It's better to secure $4800 now than risk getting less in future rounds."
