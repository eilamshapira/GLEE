"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover, but you still receive a substantial amount. Better to agree now than lose value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $5,500 while I get $4,500. While this isn't an equal split, she's right that inflation will reduce the total value if we continue negotiating.

If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be reduced by 5% to $9,500. That means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $4,750 - which is actually more than the $4,500 I'm being offered now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but still advantageous to me given the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split would be better. Even with this round's 5% inflation, we're both getting close to $5,000 each. This is fair and prevents further losses from continued negotiation. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
