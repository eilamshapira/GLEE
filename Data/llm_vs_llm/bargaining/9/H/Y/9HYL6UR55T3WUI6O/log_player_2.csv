"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   * My $400,000 would be worth only $320,000 in real value
   * Any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the significant inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive. $400,000 now is better than potentially getting more that's worth less due to inflation.
