"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is the first round and I'm aware of the inflation penalty (each round makes the money worth 20% less for me), I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while she takes $60.

If I reject and we go to round 2, I'd make an offer, but the total value to me would be reduced by 20%. So the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round.

While her offer isn't exactly equal, $40 now is better than the risk of prolonged negotiation with increasing inflation penalties.
