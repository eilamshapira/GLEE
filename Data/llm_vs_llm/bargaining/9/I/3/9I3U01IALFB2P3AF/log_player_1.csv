"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that considers both our interests and the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because:
1. Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs my 10% per round)
2. He might be motivated to accept early to minimize his value loss
3. It's still a reasonable offer that gives him a significant portion"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $5500 at 90% value = $4950 effective value
   * Bob gets $4500 at 80% value = $3600 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But values will decrease further (my money -10%, Bob's -20%)
   * I risk Bob rejecting again

This is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalties. The effective values show both of us taking a hit but still getting substantial amounts. While I could try for more in the next round, the risk and guaranteed value loss make this offer acceptable.
