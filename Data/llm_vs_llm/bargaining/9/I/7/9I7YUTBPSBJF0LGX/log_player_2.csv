"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my money will be worth less if I wait
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more in the next round but worth 5% less
5. My $400,000 share is substantial, though not equal
6. There's risk in rejection as Alice might counter with worse offers

While not a 50-50 split, this is a decent first offer. The 5% inflation penalty means waiting could cost me significantly, and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal later.
