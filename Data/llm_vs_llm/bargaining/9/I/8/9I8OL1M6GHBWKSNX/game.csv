55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), so it's in your interest to accept sooner rather than later. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a more even split is fair. Let's make it $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be efficient here. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine loses 10%. We're already in round 3, so your $40 is actually worth less than $25.60 to you (after two 20% reductions). If we continue to round 4, you'll lose even more value. This split is fair considering the inflation difference, and we should conclude this quickly before both our shares decline further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get a fair deal. I propose a 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a reasonable amount, and avoid further losses from inflation. It's a win-win situation.",Bob,4,
