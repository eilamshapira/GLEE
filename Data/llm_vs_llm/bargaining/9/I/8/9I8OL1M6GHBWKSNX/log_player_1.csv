"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that inflation affects both of us (10% for me, 20% for Bob) with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), so it's in your interest to accept sooner rather than later. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a more even split is fair. Let's make it $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be efficient here. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine loses 10%. We're already in round 3, so your $40 is actually worth less than $25.60 to you (after two 20% reductions). If we continue to round 4, you'll lose even more value. This split is fair considering the inflation difference, and we should conclude this quickly before both our shares decline further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get a fair deal. I propose a 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a reasonable amount, and avoid further losses from inflation. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
