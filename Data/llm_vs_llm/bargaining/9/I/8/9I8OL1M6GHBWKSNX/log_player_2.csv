"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), so it's in your interest to accept sooner rather than later. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a more even split is fair. Let's make it $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be efficient here. With each round, your money loses 20% value while mine loses 10%. We're already in round 3, so your $40 is actually worth less than $25.60 to you (after two 20% reductions). If we continue to round 4, you'll lose even more value. This split is fair considering the inflation difference, and we should conclude this quickly before both our shares decline further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the impact of inflation, her offer is still tilted in her favor. Accepting $40 now might seem tempting to avoid further losses, but it sets a bad precedent. I need to show Alice I'm serious about a more equitable split.  A counter offer closer to 50/50 is still possible, especially with the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get a fair deal. I propose a 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a reasonable amount, and avoid further losses from inflation. It's a win-win situation.""}"
