6889.66,3110.34,"Hi Bob, to kick things off fairly (and taking into account our different discount rates), I propose that I receive approximately $6889.66 and you receive $3110.34. This split gives you the exact value you’d expect if you were to wait until round 2 – but without the additional discount loss. I hope you agree that it’s in both our best interests to settle now.",Alice,1,
