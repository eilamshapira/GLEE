"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6889.66, ""bob_gain"": 3110.34, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to kick things off fairly (and taking into account our different discount rates), I propose that I receive approximately $6889.66 and you receive $3110.34. This split gives you the exact value you’d expect if you were to wait until round 2 – but without the additional discount loss. I hope you agree that it’s in both our best interests to settle now.""}"
