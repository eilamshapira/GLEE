"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to kick things off fairly (and taking into account our different discount rates), I propose that I receive approximately $6889.66 and you receive $3110.34. This split gives you the exact value you’d expect if you were to wait until round 2 – but without the additional discount loss. I hope you agree that it’s in both our best interests to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 3110.34 
# Alice gain: 6889.66 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

If I accept the offer, I will receive $3110.34.

If I reject the offer, I will make a proposal in the next round. Considering the inflation, the total amount of money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. So, the new total amount for me will be 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000, and for Alice, it will be 10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

However, Alice's proposal seems to take into account the discount rates and offers me the amount I would expect to receive if I were to wait until the next round. This suggests that her offer might be reasonable.

Given that Alice's offer provides me with the value I would expect in the next round without the additional discount loss, and considering that waiting will only decrease the value for both of us, I think it's a good idea to accept her proposal.
