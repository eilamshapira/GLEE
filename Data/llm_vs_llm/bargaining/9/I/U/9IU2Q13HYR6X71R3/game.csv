50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, let's start on a fair note. I propose we split the $100 evenly—$50 for you and $50 for me. I believe a fair split upfront avoids any delays that might complicate our deals further. What do you say?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your fair approach, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more. How about I get $55 and you get $45? This way, we both still get a good deal, and I can offset the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better. I'm opting to reject this proposal and will make a counteroffer in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
44.0,56.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your inflation concerns and the pressures of our negotiation. To address these while keeping things moving, I propose we split the $100 so that you receive $56 and I get $44. Given that your share is discounted by 5%, $56 in nominal terms delivers an effective value of about $53.20—slightly better than your previous position—while my share holds full value. I believe this offer is attractive for you now, avoiding further rounds and additional delays. Let me know what you think!",Alice,3,
