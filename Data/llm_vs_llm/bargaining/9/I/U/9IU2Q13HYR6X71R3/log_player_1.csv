"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start on a fair note. I propose we split the $100 evenly—$50 for you and $50 for me. I believe a fair split upfront avoids any delays that might complicate our deals further. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fair approach, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more. How about I get $55 and you get $45? This way, we both still get a good deal, and I can offset the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better. I'm opting to reject this proposal and will make a counteroffer in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 44, ""bob_gain"": 56, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your inflation concerns and the pressures of our negotiation. To address these while keeping things moving, I propose we split the $100 so that you receive $56 and I get $44. Given that your share is discounted by 5%, $56 in nominal terms delivers an effective value of about $53.20—slightly better than your previous position—while my share holds full value. I believe this offer is attractive for you now, avoiding further rounds and additional delays. Let me know what you think!""}"
