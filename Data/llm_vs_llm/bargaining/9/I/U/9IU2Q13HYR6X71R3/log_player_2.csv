"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start on a fair note. I propose we split the $100 evenly—$50 for you and $50 for me. I believe a fair split upfront avoids any delays that might complicate our deals further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fair approach, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more. How about I get $55 and you get $45? This way, we both still get a good deal, and I can offset the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your inflation concerns and the pressures of our negotiation. To address these while keeping things moving, I propose we split the $100 so that you receive $56 and I get $44. Given that your share is discounted by 5%, $56 in nominal terms delivers an effective value of about $53.20—slightly better than your previous position—while my share holds full value. I believe this offer is attractive for you now, avoiding further rounds and additional delays. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 56 
# Alice gain: 44
