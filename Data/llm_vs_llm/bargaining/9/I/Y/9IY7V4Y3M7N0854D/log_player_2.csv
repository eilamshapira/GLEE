"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start by splitting the money fairly. I propose we take 60% for me and 40% for you. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer seems unfair as Alice is asking for a larger share (60%) without providing a compelling reason. Given that this is the first round and the inflation penalty is still minimal, it's reasonable to reject and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split, which would give us each $5,000. This is the most equitable solution, and we can both walk away happy without risking further inflation losses.""}"
