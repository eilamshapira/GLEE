"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split of $60 for me and $40 for you. Given that the money loses value for me as rounds pass, it makes sense to agree now rather than risk the discount. I hope you see the fairness in settling early. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we are going to negotiate, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid any potential losses due to inflation. Letâ€™s settle this amicably! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
