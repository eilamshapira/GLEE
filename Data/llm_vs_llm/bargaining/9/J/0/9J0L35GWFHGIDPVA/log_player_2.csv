"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split of $60 for me and $40 for you. Given that the money loses value for me as rounds pass, it makes sense to agree now rather than risk the discount. I hope you see the fairness in settling early. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
