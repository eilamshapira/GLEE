"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. It's a fair offer from a traditional perspective
3. I don't lose value to inflation, but I don't know Alice's inflation rate
4. This is the first round, so I could try to negotiate for more
5. However, there's a risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds

While I could try to get more, a 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me and the offer is equitable, I'll accept it.
