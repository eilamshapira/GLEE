"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'd like to propose a fair division that acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round and I don't face any inflation, I'm offering a slightly larger portion to myself while still giving Bob a substantial share. This way we can settle quickly and both benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000}

I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives Bob a substantial portion while still acknowledging the inflation pressure he faces. Let's try to reach an agreement so we both benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 535000, ""bob_gain"": 465000}

I've adjusted my offer again to be more favorable to Bob. With each passing round, Bob's share loses 5% more value due to inflation, so we should try to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a significant portion while still being reasonable for me. I hope we can come to an agreement on this fair division and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 515000 
# Bob gain: 485000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 530000, ""bob_gain"": 470000}

I've further adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob. At this point, we're in round 7, and Bob has already lost over 25% of potential value due to inflation. This offer gives Bob a very substantial portion while still being reasonable for me. I sincerely hope we can reach an agreement now, as continuing will only reduce the overall value for both of us, particularly for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
