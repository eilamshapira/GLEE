6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000 from the $10000 pot. Considering that the money's value will decrease with each round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle now and avoid further loss. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to secure my share. Let's settle on 55% for me and 45% for you to avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but given the rate at which my share is devaluing (5% per round) and the fact that I will have the next opportunity to propose in round 3, I believe I can craft a deal that is closer to an even split. As such, I’m inclined to hold out for a better offer. Looking forward to the next round!",Alice,2,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Bob, thanks for engaging in this negotiation. Considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 90% of its nominal value, it’s in both our interests to settle soon and avoid further losses. I propose a division where I receive $4800 and you receive $5200. This offer provides you with a slightly larger nominal share while I minimize my devaluation risk. I hope you find this proposal fair under the current conditions. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,3,
