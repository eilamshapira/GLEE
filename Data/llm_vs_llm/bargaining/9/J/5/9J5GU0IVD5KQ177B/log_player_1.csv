"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000 from the $10,000 pot. Considering that the money's value will decrease with each round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle now and avoid further loss. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to secure my share. Let's settle on 55% for me and 45% for you to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but given the rate at which my share is devaluing (5% per round) and the fact that I will have the next opportunity to propose in round 3, I believe I can craft a deal that is closer to an even split. As such, I’m inclined to hold out for a better offer. Looking forward to the next round!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for engaging in this negotiation. Considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 90% of its nominal value, it’s in both our interests to settle soon and avoid further losses. I propose a division where I receive $4800 and you receive $5200. This offer provides you with a slightly larger nominal share while I minimize my devaluation risk. I hope you find this proposal fair under the current conditions. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
