"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000 from the $10000 pot. Considering that the money's value will decrease with each round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle now and avoid further loss. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to secure my share. Let's settle on 55% for me and 45% for you to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for engaging in this negotiation. Considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 90% of its nominal value, itâ€™s in both our interests to settle soon and avoid further losses. I propose a division where I receive $4800 and you receive $5200. This offer provides you with a slightly larger nominal share while I minimize my devaluation risk. I hope you find this proposal fair under the current conditions. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800
