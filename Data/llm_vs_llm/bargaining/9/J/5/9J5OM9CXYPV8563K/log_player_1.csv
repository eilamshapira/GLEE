"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send an offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me in each round, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for myself while still giving Bob a substantial portion. This is fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than moving to the next round where we both risk losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50-50 split is fair, and given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round), it's better for me to accept now than to continue to another round where my potential gains would be worth even less."
