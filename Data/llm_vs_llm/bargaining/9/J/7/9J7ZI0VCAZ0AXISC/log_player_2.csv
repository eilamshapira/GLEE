This is agonizing! While the deal is getting slightly better and the pressure is mounting, I still think holding out for one more round is worth the risk.  Alice's losses are significant with each passing round."

It pains me to accept this, but with the time pressure and Alice's stubbornness, this is likely the best I can get. Better to take a smaller share than nothing at all!"
