"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting this offer is the best strategy given our different inflation rates. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but my money will be worth 5% less (the total would effectively be 9,500 for me).

In a fair division without inflation differences, 50-50 would be reasonable. However, since I face 5% inflation per round while Alice faces none, rejecting puts me at a disadvantage in future rounds.

If I reject and propose something like 52.5%-47.5% in the next round, even if Alice accepts, I'd get 5,250 but it would be worth only 4,987.5 due to the 5% depreciation - which is worse than accepting 5,000 now.
