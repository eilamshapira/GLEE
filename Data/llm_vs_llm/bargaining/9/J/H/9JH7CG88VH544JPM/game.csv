550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a reasonable split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, delaying would decrease the value for me significantly. This is a fair offer that benefits us both without the need for further negotiations and inflation losses.",Alice,1,
