"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This offer is far too uneven, giving Alice 90% of the money and me only 10%. Even with the 10% inflation penalty per round, I can still propose a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a more equitable split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage but still provides Alice with a substantial sum. Given that Alice faces no inflation penalty and I do, this split gives both of us incentive to agree now rather than continue negotiating. If Alice rejects this, she risks getting a worse offer in the next round after I face a 10% penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. Here's why:
1. Due to 19% inflation, my $450,000 is effectively worth $364,500
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll face 29% inflation
3. Even if I propose a higher split in my favor next round, Alice could reject again, leading to even more inflation for me
4. This is a reasonable compromise from Alice's initial low offer of just $100,000
5. The split is relatively fair, and the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now than risk further rounds"
