"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll consider a fair division while keeping in mind that Bob faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion upfront while acknowledging that I have a stronger position due to the asymmetric inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
