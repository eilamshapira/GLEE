833333.0,166667.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I keep $833333 while you receive $166667. If you wait until the next round, your share will be worth 20% less due to inflation. I believe this is a fair division given the cost of delay. What do you say?",Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,"I think it's fair to split the money 90/10 in my favor. You get 100000 now, or risk getting nothing at all next round. Remember, the money is losing value.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to reject it. The option to propose in the next round, despite the slight decrease in the total value for me, still promises a much better outcome than $100000. I look forward to our next round of negotiations.",Alice,2,reject
333333.0,666667.0,"Hi Bob, here's my round 3 proposal. With the inflation, the $1000000 is now worth only 90% for me and 60% for you compared to round 1. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4 when your money will be worth only 40% of its nominal valueâ€”that is, you can secure an effective value of about $400000. My offer gives you 666667 nominal dollars, which, at 60%, equals exactly $400000 effective. I take the remaining 333333 (worth $300000 for me), which is the maximum I can get while making you just as well off as waiting. I believe this is a fair and logical proposal given the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,3,
