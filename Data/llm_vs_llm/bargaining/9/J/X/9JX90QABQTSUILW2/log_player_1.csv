"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 833333, ""bob_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer: I keep $833,333 while you receive $166,667. If you wait until the next round, your share will be worth 20% less due to inflation. I believe this is a fair division given the cost of delay. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 90/10 in my favor. You get 100000 now, or risk getting nothing at all next round. Remember, the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to reject it. The option to propose in the next round, despite the slight decrease in the total value for me, still promises a much better outcome than $100,000. I look forward to our next round of negotiations.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 333333, ""bob_gain"": 666667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my round 3 proposal. With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth only 90% for me and 60% for you compared to round 1. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4 when your money will be worth only 40% of its nominal valueâ€”that is, you can secure an effective value of about $400,000. My offer gives you 666,667 nominal dollars, which, at 60%, equals exactly $400,000 effective. I take the remaining 333,333 (worth $300,000 for me), which is the maximum I can get while making you just as well off as waiting. I believe this is a fair and logical proposal given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
