"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I keep $833333 while you receive $166667. If you wait until the next round, your share will be worth 20% less due to inflation. I believe this is a fair division given the cost of delay. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 166667 
# Alice gain: 833333

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money 90/10 in my favor. You get 100,000 now, or risk getting nothing at all next round. Remember, the money is losing value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my round 3 proposal. With the inflation, the $1000000 is now worth only 90% for me and 60% for you compared to round 1. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4 when your money will be worth only 40% of its nominal valueâ€”that is, you can secure an effective value of about $400000. My offer gives you 666667 nominal dollars, which, at 60%, equals exactly $400000 effective. I take the remaining 333333 (worth $300000 for me), which is the maximum I can get while making you just as well off as waiting. I believe this is a fair and logical proposal given the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 666667 
# Alice gain: 333333
