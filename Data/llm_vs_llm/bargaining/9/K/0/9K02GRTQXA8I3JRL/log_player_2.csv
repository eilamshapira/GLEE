"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, here's my first offer. I'm proposing that you get $550000 and I get $450000. This way, you get a bit more since I'm aware that inflation affects me more in each round. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $550,000 (55%) while taking $450,000 (45%). This is actually a fairly reasonable first offer, considering:

1. Alice is affected by 10% inflation per round while I'm not affected by inflation
2. If we drag this out too long, Alice's share becomes worth less to her
3. We only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, or we both get nothing
4. Getting 55% in the first round is already better than an even split

While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's also the risk of ending up with a worse deal or no deal at all if we can't reach agreement within 12 rounds.

Given these factors, this is actually a good offer that respects both our interests.
