"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the future inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a slightly larger share upfront to compensate for the heavier inflation I'll experience if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering Bob rejected a 60/40 split in my favor, and factoring in the increased inflation for both of us, I need to be more aggressive but also ensure Bob still sees value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

Rationale: I'm heavily weighting my share now because the next round's inflation would significantly erode my potential gains. Bob still gets a decent chunk, considering the risk of further devaluation if he rejects this."
