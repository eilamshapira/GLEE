"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, while you don't have the same constraint. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split acknowledges the time pressure I face while still giving you a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation impact more carefully, as we're now in round 3 and each round reduces my value by 20%.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split. With the inflation penalty I face (now at 40% less value for me after two rounds), we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a very good portion while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. Let's avoid further rounds where the total value continues to decrease for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
