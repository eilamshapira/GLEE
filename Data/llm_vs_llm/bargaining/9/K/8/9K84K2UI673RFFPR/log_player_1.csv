"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since I know that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me, I should aim for a fair split that Bob would accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid any inflation penalties."
