"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer in this negotiation game. Given the inflation effect, I'd like to propose a fair split that reflects our situation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and you receive $45. This is a reasonable offer considering that inflation will reduce the value of money for me in future rounds, so I need to secure a slightly better deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that we're both pushing for a slightly advantageous split. Let me propose a more balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I receive $52 and you receive $48. This is fair considering I face a higher inflation rate (10% per round) than you do (5% per round). Let's come to an agreement so we can both benefit before inflation reduces our gains too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
