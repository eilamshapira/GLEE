Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's still early in the game, and I'm aiming for a more equitable split closer to 50/50.  I'm hoping Alice will become more agreeable as the rounds progress and the value diminishes."
