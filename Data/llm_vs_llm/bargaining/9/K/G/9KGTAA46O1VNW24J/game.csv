600000.0,400000.0,Let's make a fair split considering inflation will affect my gains in future rounds. I propose a 60-40 split in our favor. This is reasonable and we can both walk away happy.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given the impact of inflation on your gains, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you over time, yet still provides a substantial amount for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's be practical here. With 10% inflation impact already, I need to secure a reasonable amount. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good sum. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing value. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your gains, now at nearly 10%, my proposal of a 60-40 split in my favor still leaves you with a considerable amount. We're nearing the midpoint of our rounds, and it's crucial we reach an agreement soon to avoid losing more value. Let's settle this round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. With inflation now at over 14%, I've reduced my expectations to a 52.5-47.5 split. This is a very fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation impact. Further delays will only hurt both of us. Let's conclude this deal now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, with inflation now severely impacting your gains by over 18%, my proposal of a 65-35 split in my favor still ensures you receive a significant amount. We're running out of time, and further delays will only diminish the value of our agreement. Let's finalize this now to secure what we can.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, I'm making a significant concession here with a 51-49 split. With inflation at 22.62%, my actual gain is only about $394638. We're more than halfway through our rounds, and your increasingly aggressive offers aren't helping either of us. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now before we both lose everything.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at over 26%, your gains are significantly impacted. My offer of a 70-30 split in my favor might seem high, but it still leaves you with a substantial amount considering the real value. We're running out of rounds, and it's critical we agree soon. Let's finalize this to ensure we both walk away with something.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, your increasingly aggressive offers are pushing us toward mutual destruction. I'm forced to increase my ask to 55-45 because with 30.17% inflation, I would only receive about $384000 in real value. We have just 3 rounds left. If we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This offer is fair given the circumstances - let's end this now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at over 33%, your gains are severely diminished. My offer of a 75-25 split in my favor might seem steep, but it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. We only have two rounds left, and if we don't settle now, we risk losing everything. Let's finalize this to ensure we both walk away with something.",Bob,10,
