Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's calculate the adjusted value due to inflation. Since this is round 3, my money is worth 20% less than in round 1 (10% per round * 2 rounds of inflation). Bob's money is worth 10% less than in round 1 (5% per round * 2 rounds of inflation).

I need to make an offer that reflects this depreciation, but also incentivizes Bob to accept. I'll aim for a slightly more generous offer than before.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, time to recalculate the inflation impact and adjust my offer. This is Round 5.

*   **My inflation:** 34.39% less value than Round 1 (Calculated as 1 - (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9))
*   **Bob's inflation:** 18.55% less value than Round 1 (Calculated as 1 - (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95))

To account for this, I need to offer Bob a larger share to make it worthwhile for him, but also try to secure a decent amount for myself considering the value depreciation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
