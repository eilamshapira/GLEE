Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a split that's reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on both of us, Alice's offer seems quite unfair. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 14.76% less for me (5% less in round 2 and 9.75% less in round 3, combined) and 19% less for Alice in round 3, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant inflation effects, especially on Alice's side, I think I can get a better deal. However, the inflation is also eating into my potential gains. I'll reject this offer, but I should be cautious not to let the game drag on too much longer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effects, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. The money is worth 23.08% less for me, and 34.39% + 5% (assuming similar inflation for Alice) = 39.39% less for Alice. I'll propose a split that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.
