"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation for me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I aim to secure a reasonable portion before the inflation impacts my gains too much."
