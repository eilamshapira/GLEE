"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So $100 in the next round is effectively worth $90 to me.

With Alice's current offer, I would get $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I propose getting $60, it would only be worth $54 to me due to inflation (90% of $60).

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, getting $40 now is likely better than risking further negotiations with the inflation penalty.
