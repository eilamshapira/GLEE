"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle quickly to avoid the inflation hit on my share. I'm offering an even split of $5,000 each—fair and simple. I hope you agree to close the game now rather than risk any further loss in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. While I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share given the risk of inflation. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? We can avoid further potential losses this way. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

However, every further round further erodes my side’s value due to inflation. I’m prepared to offer you $6,200 while I take $3,800. Let’s settle now and avoid additional losses. I hope you find this offer reasonable and accept it promptly.""}"
