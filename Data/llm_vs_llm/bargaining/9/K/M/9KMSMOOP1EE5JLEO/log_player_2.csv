"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle quickly to avoid the inflation hit on my share. I'm offering an even split of $5000 each—fair and simple. I hope you agree to close the game now rather than risk any further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. While I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share given the risk of inflation. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? We can avoid further potential losses this way.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your need for an improved share given the risks. However, every further round further erodes my side’s value due to inflation. I’m prepared to offer you $6200 while I take $3800. Let’s settle now and avoid additional losses. I hope you find this offer reasonable and accept it promptly. 
# Bob gain: 6200 
# Alice gain: 3800
