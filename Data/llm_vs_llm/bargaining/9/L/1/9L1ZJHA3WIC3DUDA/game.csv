500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars evenlyâ€”$500K each. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 10% inflation hit for me in later rounds. Let's settle this fairly and promptly!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation pressure you mentioned, I propose a 60-40 split. This gives you $400K now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! Given that further rounds would further reduce the real value of my share (and knowing that as rounds progress I'd be in the less advantageous position), I believe your 400K proposal is the best available option. I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
