"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars evenlyâ€”$500K each. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 10% inflation hit for me in later rounds. Let's settle this fairly and promptly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation pressure you mentioned, I propose a 60-40 split. This gives you $400K now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! Given that further rounds would further reduce the real value of my share (and knowing that as rounds progress I'd be in the less advantageous position), I believe your 400K proposal is the best available option. I accept your offer.""}"
