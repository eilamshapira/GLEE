"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars evenlyâ€”$500K each. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 10% inflation hit for me in later rounds. Let's settle this fairly and promptly! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500K each)
2. She mentions inflation affecting her, but I know there's no inflation effect on my side
3. This is a fair split from a purely mathematical perspective
4. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I don't lose anything by negotiating further
5. Given that I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in the next round without any downside for me, it makes strategic sense to reject this offer

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I know I don't face any inflation penalty while Alice does, I can use this to my advantage. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept given her inflation concerns.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation pressure you mentioned, I propose a 60-40 split. This gives you $400K now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""}"
