"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer, considering I'm making the first proposal. 60 for me, 40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round, so the $100 total will effectively be worth $90. However, I'll get to make the next proposal.

Alice's offer of $40 to me is less than half, but it's not terrible. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses.

Given that:
1. Getting $40 now is better than risking further inflation
2. The first-mover often has some advantage in negotiations
3. This is a reasonable starting offer
4. We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
