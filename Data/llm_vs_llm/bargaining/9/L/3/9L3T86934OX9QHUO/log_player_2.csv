"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, considering the inflation and the need to reach an agreement, I'll make a more reasonable offer.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for $600,000, leaving Alice with $400,000. This is a significantly better offer for her than her initial proposal, and hopefully enough to entice her to accept. The inflation is a real concern, so securing a good portion now is important."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Alice is clearly driving a hard bargain. Inflation is becoming a significant factor for me. I will adjust my offer to be more appealing, but still secure a reasonable amount considering the circumstances.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm reducing my take to $550,000, giving Alice $450,000. This is an increase of $50,000 for her compared to my previous offer, and should demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate. It is still a good amount for me, given the inflation. Hopefully, she will see this as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, this is getting serious. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I need to make an offer that Alice will *actually* accept, while still getting something worthwhile.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```

My reasoning: A 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer I can make at this point, given the circumstances. Hopefully, Alice will see reason and we can finally come to an agreement. I am risking quite a bit with the inflation, so this really is my best offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Alice is being completely unreasonable. The inflation is killing me. I need to make a difficult choice, but I also need to avoid getting nothing.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Alice a majority share of $550,000, while I take $450,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but the increasing inflation makes securing *something* more important than holding out for a better deal that will likely never come. I hope Alice finally accepts. This is as far as I can reasonably go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is incredibly frustrating. Alice is clearly trying to run me out of time, and the inflation is devastating. I'm going to make a desperate offer, prioritizing getting something over holding out for a fair split.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm further reducing my share to $400,000, giving Alice a substantial $600,000. At this point, avoiding zero is my primary goal. This is likely my last chance to get anything worthwhile. I sincerely hope Alice accepts this offer, as it's extremely generous on my part, given her previous behavior and the inflation."

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is it. Last chance. Inflation has decimated my potential gains. I have to make an offer that Alice *absolutely* cannot refuse, even if it leaves me with very little.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""alice_gain"": 700000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Alice a whopping $700,000, leaving me with a mere $300,000. It's humiliating, but with the inflation and the deadline looming, getting *something* is better than getting nothing. This is my final, desperate plea for a deal. I pray Alice accepts."
