Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation looming, let's secure a better deal for me since I'm more affected by it. 65-35 is fair. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a new proposal in the next round, as getting only $35 with 20% inflation (effectively $28) is too low. Bob's claim about being more affected by inflation wasn't accurate based on the information given (my 20% vs his 10%)."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. Due to the 20% inflation on my side and 10% on yours, this 55-45 split actually results in me getting $44 effective value and you getting $40.5 effective value. This is quite fair and we should conclude before further inflation hits.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm willing to go to 60-40 so we can finalize this. Remember, I'm affected by inflation! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with the severe inflation (48.8%), if I wait another round, any amount I receive will be worth much less. Even if I could get a higher nominal amount in the next round, the effective value would likely be lower than accepting $40 now (which is worth about $20.48 after the current inflation). It's better to secure this amount now than risk further value erosion."
