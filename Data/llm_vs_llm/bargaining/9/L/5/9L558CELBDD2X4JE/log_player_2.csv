Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical here. Due to the 20% inflation on my side and 10% on yours, this 55-45 split actually results in me getting $44 effective value and you getting $40.5 effective value. This is quite fair and we should conclude before further inflation hits.
