"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Due to inflation, my money is worth less now. My original $60 offer is now worth only $60 * 0.95 = $57.

Bob's offer is $50 for me. However, I still have 11 rounds left. If I reject, I could potentially get a better offer. I will reject Bob's offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's round 3. My money is now worth even less.

I will offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the real value of the money again. My original $60 offer is now worth $60 * (1-0.05)^3 = $51.34.

Bob's offer is $45. Given the inflation, this $45 offer is a better offer than it may seem, but it is still not good enough. I am only 4 rounds into the game and I still have the possibility of a better offer. I will reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 5. The money is getting less valuable for me with each round.

I will offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down again. My original $60 offer is now worth $60 * (1-0.05)^5 = $46.46.

Bob's offer is $42. Given the inflation, this $42 offer is a very bad offer. I have a better chance of getting a better offer later. I will reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, Round 7. The situation is getting more pressing. My money is losing value quickly.

I will make a more conservative offer this time:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
