"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money now, considering the 10% inflation.

In round 1, I proposed 6000 for myself.

In round 2, my gain would be worth 10% less than in round 1.

Therefore, the value of Bob's offer for me is 4500.
I need to compare what I would gain if I reject now. I will need to make the offer in the next round, so my gain would be worth 10% less than now.

I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, considering the 10% inflation from round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down.

*   **Inflation:** The money is now worth 27.1% less than in Round 1. This means the value of the money has decreased significantly for me.

*   **Bob's Offer:** He's offering me $4750.

Let's see if I should accept this offer. Since I'm calculating the value of the money, here is the calculation:
Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 100% - 10% = 90%
Round 3: 90% - 10% = 80%
Round 4: 80% - 10% = 70%

Then the value of Bob's offer for me is 4750.

I have to consider if I reject, I will make the offer in the next round, and the money is worth even less. I need to make the calculation and accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
