Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to being fair, it's still tilted in Alice's favor. Since I don't know how inflation is affecting her, I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more open to a better offer for me in later rounds.  The 19% inflation is a factor, but it's not yet at a crisis level."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking close to my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but also indicating I'm serious about getting a slightly favorable split. This round, I'm giving a bit more to Alice, hoping she'll find it reasonable."
