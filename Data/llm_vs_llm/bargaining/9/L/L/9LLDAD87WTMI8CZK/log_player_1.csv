I propose to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  This is a fair starting point, and allows Bob to get something while still allowing me to secure a large share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still offering a significant share to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept, as the money he receives will be worth less with each passing round."
