"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered me $100,000 while taking $900,000 for herself. This is a very uneven split that heavily favors her. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs her 10%), I still need to consider whether rejecting will lead to a better outcome.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (so $800,000 in equivalent value). Even if I were to propose a much more favorable split, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss.

However, $100,000 out of $1,000,000 is only 10% of the total, which is too low to accept in the first round when I have leverage to make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice will likely accept, considering the inflation factors and game dynamics.

Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice this round (compared to 20% less for me), she still has an incentive to reach an agreement. If she rejects my offer, the total pot would be worth even less to both of us in the next round.

I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our positions:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This gives Alice a slight advantage (55%) while still securing a reasonable portion for myself (45%). This is a fair compromise considering the asymmetric inflation rates, and should be attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to the next round where both of us would lose more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $200,000 while taking $800,000 for herself. I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation factors.

Current situation:
- We're in Round 3
- Due to inflation, any money I receive is worth 36% less than in Round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 19% less than in Round 1
- If I reject, we'll go to Round 4, where my inflation will be even worse (around 49% less)

Alice has doubled her initial offer to me (from $100,000 to $200,000). While $200,000 is still only 20% of the total, I need to consider that:
1. The effective value of the $200,000 to me is about $128,000 in Round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I propose a better split, the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains more quickly than Alice's

Given the asymmetric inflation rates working against me, and the improved offer from Alice, it makes sense to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
