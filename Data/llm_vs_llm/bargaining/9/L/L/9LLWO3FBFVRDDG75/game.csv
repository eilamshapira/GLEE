550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you 45% of the total sum, which is a fair division considering I face a 20% penalty in value for each round we delay. If we move to round 2, the total value for me would drop to $800000, making prolonged negotiation costly for me but not for you. This offer respects both our interests.",Alice,1,
