"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you 45% of the total sum, which is a fair division considering I face a 20% penalty in value for each round we delay. If we move to round 2, the total value for me would drop to $800000, making prolonged negotiation costly for me but not for you. This offer respects both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
