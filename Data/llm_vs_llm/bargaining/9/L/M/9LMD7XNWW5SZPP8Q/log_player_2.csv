"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $400,000 while she takes $600,000. Given that the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, waiting would mean my negotiating power is reduced.

If I reject, I'd get to make a counter-offer, but the total value to me would only be $800,000 (due to 20% inflation). So any counter-offer would need to get me significantly more than $400,000 to be worthwhile.
