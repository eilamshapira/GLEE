"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 
Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair. However, with the inflation effect, if I reject now and we go another round, the $50 would be worth 10% less to me ($45).

Since this is a fair offer and any delay will reduce the value for me, I should accept this proposal.
