150000.0,850000.0,"Hi Alice, if we delay further your share loses 10% in value each round while mine remains strong. Accepting this offer now secures you $150000 in nominal terms—better than risking further discount. Let's keep it simple and fair by wrapping up this round.",Bob,2,

,,,Bob,3,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you about 10% more in effective value—as of now, your $50000 would still be worth roughly $36450. If you push to round 5, the discount deepens even further. I’m offering you this deal to avoid a future reduction in your share. Please accept—let’s close the deal now rather than see more value evaporate.",Bob,4,

,,,Bob,5,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"Alice, waiting further only guarantees you nothing. In round 7 as proposer you'd be forced to concede nearly the entire pie to me, due to the discount you face. Accepting this round secures you $10000 nominal (worth about $5904 in round-1 value) rather than ending up empty‐handed. Time is money—let's settle now.",Bob,6,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject now, waiting until round 9 you will face even harsher terms, and by round 11 you'll be forced to concede almost everything to me given your steep discount. Accepting this minimal offer now gives you something rather than nothing. Let's finish this and avoid further loss in value.",Bob,8,

,,,Bob,9,reject
50.0,999950.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll move to round 11 where your discount deepens even further and my control over the division becomes even stronger. Accepting $50 now—even though it might seem small—guarantees you something, whereas delaying will almost certainly leave you with nothing of real value. Let's close this deal before your share erodes any further.",Bob,10,

,,,Bob,11,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, this is round 12—the final round. If you reject, we both walk away empty-handed. Given your money's steep discount now, even $1 is worth more than nothing. Accept this offer and secure at least something rather than risking total loss.",Bob,12,
