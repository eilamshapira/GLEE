"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Alice each round), if I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases. For me, the $100 would be worth $90 next round, and for Alice it would be worth $80.

If I reject and make my own offer next round, Alice might still reject it, and we'd lose more value. Since I still get a substantial portion and we avoid the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
