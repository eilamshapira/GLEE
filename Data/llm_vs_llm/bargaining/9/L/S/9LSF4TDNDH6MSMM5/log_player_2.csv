"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I believe this is a good starting point for us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
3. While this isn't a 50-50 split, getting $40 now is better than $45 next round (due to 10% inflation)
4. There's also risk in continuing negotiations

Since $40 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation, and the split isn't terribly unfair...
