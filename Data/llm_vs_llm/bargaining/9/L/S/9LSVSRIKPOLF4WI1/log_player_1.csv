"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and I hope Bob will accept it so we can both walk away with a reasonable sum."
