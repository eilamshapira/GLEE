"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject and move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire $1,000,000 would be worth only $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I would need to propose something that gives me more than $400,000 after accounting for the 10% inflation. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value through inflation if negotiations continue, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
