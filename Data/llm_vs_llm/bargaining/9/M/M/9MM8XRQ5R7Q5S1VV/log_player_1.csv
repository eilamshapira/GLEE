"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair initial offer that acknowledges the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we split the money almost evenly, with me getting a slightly larger portion to offset the inflation risk I face. This is fair since we both deserve an equal share, but I need to account for the 10% value loss I'll face if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation is impacting me more than Bob, and I should factor this into my decision. Since Bob only faces 5% inflation per round while I face 10%, I should try for a better split that accounts for this difference."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer based on our inflation differences.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split to account for the difference in inflation rates between us. Since I face 10% inflation per round while you only face 5%, this division helps balance the disadvantage I have from delays. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both more than continuing further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer now. With the increasing inflation impact (my money now worth 27.1% less, while Bob's is only 14.26% less), continuing to reject offers becomes increasingly costly for me. The difference in our inflation rates means my bargaining position weakens more rapidly with each round. $4500 now is better than potentially getting even less in future rounds after accounting for inflation."
