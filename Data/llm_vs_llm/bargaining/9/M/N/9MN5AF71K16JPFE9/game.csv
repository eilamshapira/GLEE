5500.0,4500.0,"Let's split it fairly, Bob. This gives us both a good amount and avoids inflation penalties on your end. I'm offering slightly more for myself to compensate for the fact that the value of money remains constant for me, while it depreciates for you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation penalty I face, I believe this offer is more balanced. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better starting point.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, my money isn't losing value. Your 6000 in the previous round, adjusted for inflation, is worth only 4800. This offer gives us each more relative value than your last offer did, and it's fair given the circumstances. Let's take this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I still think we can find a middle ground. This offer takes into account the depreciation of my share, while also considering your constant value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6700.0,3300.0,"Bob, the longer we wait, the less your money is worth. Your 5500 is now worth significantly less than my offer to you. Consider that your 3300 is effectively worth 1711.6. My 6700 remains at 6700. This deal is still beneficial for both of us, but time is running out for you.",Alice,5,
