  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This gives us both a good amount and avoids inflation penalties on your end. I'm offering slightly more for myself to compensate for the fact that the value of money remains constant for me, while it depreciates for you.""

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation penalty I face, I believe this offer is more balanced. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
