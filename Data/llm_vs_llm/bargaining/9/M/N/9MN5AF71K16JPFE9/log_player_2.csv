"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. This gives us both a good amount and avoids inflation penalties on your end. I'm offering slightly more for myself to compensate for the fact that the value of money remains constant for me, while it depreciates for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

# Alice's message: Bob, my money isn't losing value. Your 6000 in the previous round, adjusted for inflation, is worth only 4800. This offer gives us each more relative value than your last offer did, and it's fair given the circumstances. Let's take this deal.
