"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $49 while she takes $51.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me). 

The current offer gives me $49, which is quite fair and close to an even split. If I reject, I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more depreciation for me.

Given that this offer is close to 50/50 and any delay reduces the money's value for me, I'll accept this offer.
