"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
3. In the next round, maximum I could get would be $900,000 (if I propose a 90-10 split), but with 10% inflation, that would be worth $810,000 to me
4. Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway
5. A reasonable counter-offer might get me $500,000-$600,000, but with 10% inflation, that would be $450,000-$540,000

While 40% isn't ideal, getting $400,000 now is probably better than risking inflation and potential rejection in the next round. The offer is reasonable enough considering the circumstances.
