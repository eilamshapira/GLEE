"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

I'm being offered $45 while Alice keeps $55. While it's not a perfectly equal split, it's fairly reasonable and close to 50-50. Rejecting might lead to a back-and-forth negotiation that could waste rounds and risk both of us getting nothing. Given that it's a decent offer in the first round, I'll accept it.
