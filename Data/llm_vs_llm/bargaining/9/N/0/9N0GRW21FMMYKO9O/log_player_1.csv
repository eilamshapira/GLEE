"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob. I need to consider the inflation effect on me, but I don't know how it affects Bob. To maximize my chances of a deal, especially early on, I'll offer a generous split while the money is still worth a lot to me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
