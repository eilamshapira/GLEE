Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face higher inflation pressure than I do, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still fair considering the circumstances, and we can avoid further value loss by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but that's exactly why I need a higher share. My money loses value faster, so I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with fair effective value. Let's settle this now before we both lose more to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be rational about this. Your money is now worth less than half its original value due to your 20% inflation rate, while mine has only lost about 15%. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for you. A 65-35 split now is better for you than a 50-50 split would be in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation math, but that's precisely why I need a larger share now. At 60-40, accounting for our different inflation rates, we both still walk away with meaningful value. If we continue, I'll need to ask for an even larger percentage to compensate for my higher inflation rate. Let's be practical and settle now - this offer is fair given our different circumstances.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's look at the real values: Your $60 offer from last round was only worth $24.60 to you after your inflation. The $30 I'm offering you now is worth more to you in real terms than what you just proposed to yourself. My $70 share is fair given that my money loses value much more slowly. This is your best option - further delays will only destroy more value for both of us, but especially for you.

# Bob gain: 70

Round 7

After 7 rounds of inflation, my share needs to be larger to compensate for my 20% loss per round. With a 70-30 split, we're both still walking away with meaningful value given our different inflation rates. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for an even larger percentage as my money rapidly loses value. This is actually a fair offer considering our different circumstances - let's finalize this now.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you need to understand that demanding more nominal dollars while losing 20% value per round is hurting you more than me. Let's do the math: The $30 I'm offering you now is worth more in real value than the $70 you just proposed for yourself (which was only worth $18.35 to you after inflation). If you reject this, your next share will be worth even less due to your 20% inflation rate. We have only 4 rounds left before we both get nothing. This is a fair offer given our circumstances - take it now before your value drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
