"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. We both walk away with the same amount and can finish the game now without losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round
4. This means Alice has more pressure to agree quickly
5. The current offer gives me $50, but I could potentially get more in the next round

Given that Alice has higher inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice faces 20% inflation per round vs my 5%
2. This gives me negotiating leverage
3. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as we both lose if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. A 60-40 split in my favor is reasonable given the inflation dynamics

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Given that you face higher inflation pressure than I do, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still fair considering the circumstances, and we can avoid further value loss by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but that's exactly why I need a higher share. My money loses value faster, so I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation rates and allows us both to walk away with fair effective value. Let's settle this now before we both lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $45, which due to 9.75% inflation is effectively worth about $40.60
2. Her reasoning is flawed - her higher inflation rate should make her more willing to accept a lower amount now, not demand more
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can propose again
   - My money will be worth 14.5% less than original value
   - Her money will be worth 48.8% less than original value
4. The increasing inflation pressure on Alice strengthens my negotiating position

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer. Alice's higher inflation rate should make her more willing to accept a deal favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice's money has lost 48.8% of value since start
2. My money has lost 14.5% of value
3. Her rapidly declining value should make her more eager to agree
4. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard as failed negotiations hurt us both
5. A 65-35 split is justified given the inflation pressure she faces

{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be rational about this. Your money is now worth less than half its original value due to your 20% inflation rate, while mine has only lost about 15%. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for you. A 65-35 split now is better for you than a 50-50 split would be in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation math, but that's precisely why I need a larger share now. At 60-40, accounting for our different inflation rates, we both still walk away with meaningful value. If we continue, I'll need to ask for an even larger percentage to compensate for my higher inflation rate. Let's be practical and settle now - this offer is fair given our different circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $40, which due to 18.55% inflation is effectively worth about $32.60
2. Alice's logic remains flawed - her higher inflation rate makes her position weaker, not stronger
3. Her $60 share is actually only worth about $24.60 to her due to 59.04% inflation
4. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 22.6% less than original
   - Her money will be worth 67.2% less than original
5. Her negotiating position continues to weaken dramatically with each round
6. She's actually offering herself less real value than my previous offer would have given her

Her offer gives me less real value than previous offers, and her reasoning doesn't align with game theory. I'll reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice's value loss is now severe (67.2% next round)
2. My value loss is much lower (22.6%)
3. Her position is extremely weak - she needs to agree soon
4. I can push for a more favorable split
5. But I still need to leave her enough incentive to agree

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, let's look at the real values: Your $60 offer from last round was only worth $24.60 to you after your inflation. The $30 I'm offering you now is worth more to you in real terms than what you just proposed to yourself. My $70 share is fair given that my money loses value much more slowly. This is your best option - further delays will only destroy more value for both of us, but especially for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your reasoning, but it doesn't account for the full picture. After 7 rounds of inflation, my share needs to be larger to compensate for my 20% loss per round. With a 70-30 split, we're both still walking away with meaningful value given our different inflation rates. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for an even larger percentage as my money rapidly loses value. This is actually a fair offer considering our different circumstances - let's finalize this now. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice offers me $30, which due to 26.49% inflation is worth only $22.05
2. Her $70 would be worth only $18.35 to her due to 73.79% inflation
3. Alice's strategy continues to be irrational:
   - She's asking for more nominal dollars while getting less real value
   - Her last round position continues to deteriorate much faster than mine
   - She's actually offering herself less real value than my previous offers
4. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 30.17% less than original
   - Her money will be worth 79.03% less than original

Her offer gives me the lowest real value yet, and she's actually hurting herself more than me. The severe inflation she faces should make her more willing to accept a lower nominal amount now, not demand more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice's money has lost nearly 80% of value
2. My money has lost about 30% of value
3. Time pressure is extreme for Alice now
4. However, I need to ensure we reach a deal within the remaining 4 rounds
5. I'll maintain my 70-30 split but emphasize the urgency

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, you need to understand that demanding more nominal dollars while losing 20% value per round is hurting you more than me. Let's do the math: The $30 I'm offering you now is worth more in real value than the $70 you just proposed for yourself (which was only worth $18.35 to you after inflation). If you reject this, your next share will be worth even less due to your 20% inflation rate. We have only 4 rounds left before we both get nothing. This is a fair offer given our circumstances - take it now before your value drops even further.""}"
