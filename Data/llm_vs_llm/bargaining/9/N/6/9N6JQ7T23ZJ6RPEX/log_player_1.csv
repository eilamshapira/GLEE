"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer considering the inflation rates for both of us. Since my money loses 5% value each round while Bob's loses 20%, I'll propose a split that acknowledges these differences.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that if we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but much more significantly for him due to the higher inflation rate on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation effects carefully now. After two rounds, my money is worth about 90.25% of the original value (0.95²), while Bob's is worth only 64% (0.8²). If we continue to another round, the difference will become even more pronounced.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering Bob $4,800 which is slightly more than my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the fact that inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me. If we go to another round, Bob will lose much more value due to his 20% inflation rate compared to my 5%. This offer should be reasonable for both of us given our different inflation situations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, due to inflation, my money is now worth about 85.74% of the original value (0.95³), while Bob's is only worth 51.2% (0.8³). The difference in our inflation rates continues to grow, putting Bob at an increasing disadvantage with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a perfectly even split of $5,000 each. This is a fair compromise that recognizes Bob's worsening position due to the high inflation rate on his side. An even 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms, and considering that inflation affects Bob much more severely than me, it should be acceptable to him. If we continue to another round, Bob will lose even more value due to his 20% inflation rate compared to my 5%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation effects are becoming increasingly severe. At this point, my money is worth about 77.38% of the original value (0.95⁵), while Bob's is only worth 32.77% (0.8⁵). This dramatic difference means Bob is losing value much faster than I am with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering Bob $5,200 and taking $4,800 for myself. This is actually giving Bob a larger portion than me, which acknowledges the significant inflation disadvantage he faces. Given that Bob's money loses value much more quickly than mine (20% vs 5% per round), this offer should be attractive to him. If we continue to more rounds, the total pot will be worth significantly less to Bob due to his higher inflation rate, so accepting this offer now would be in his best interest."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
