"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time, Alice. 55% for me, 45% for you. I think it's fair considering we're both in this together, and it's a good starting point for a reasonable negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the 10% inflation per round and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, it's wise to accept this reasonable offer early. The difference between my initial proposal and Bob's counter-proposal is relatively small, and accepting now means we avoid further value loss from inflation. This is a fair deal that gives both parties a substantial amount."
