Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Before making my offer, I want to calculate the actual value of the money for me and Alice, considering the inflation.

For me, the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value due to the 9.75% inflation over 4 rounds.
For Alice, the money is now worth 81% of its original value due to the 19% inflation over 4 rounds.

So, if I offer myself $X and Alice $Y, the actual value for me is 0.9025 * $X and for Alice is 0.81 * $Y.

I want to make an offer that is fair in terms of actual value. So, I want to solve the following system of equations:

0.9025 * $X = 0.81 * $Y
$X + $Y = $10,000

Solving this system of equations gives me:

$X ≈ 5200
$Y ≈ 4800

So, my offer is:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""alice_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
