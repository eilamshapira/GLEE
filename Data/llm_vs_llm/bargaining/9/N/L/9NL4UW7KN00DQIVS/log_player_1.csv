"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to make a fair offer, but also account for the potential of inflation devaluing my share in later rounds. I'll propose a split that gives me a slight advantage to start.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Let's calculate the value of the money considering inflation.

My gain would be $5000, but it's worth 5% less, so $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 in round 1 dollars.

While the offer is fair in nominal terms, the inflation is hurting me. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal considering the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose. Considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I need to adjust my offer to compensate. I'll aim for a larger share this time, but not so large that Bob automatically rejects.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in round 4.

Bob is offering me $4800. However, due to inflation, this is worth $4800 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4800 * 0.8574 = $4115.52 in round 1 dollars.

He gets $5200, worth $5200 * (1 - 0.271) = $5200 * 0.729 = $3790.80 in round 1 dollars.

Even though the nominal amount he's getting is higher, the real value is lower than what I'm being offered, adjusted for inflation to round 1 dollars.. Given that the inflation is taking a significant toll and we are approaching the halfway point, I'll take this offer.
