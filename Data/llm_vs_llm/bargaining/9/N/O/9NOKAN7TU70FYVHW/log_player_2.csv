"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose taking $55 for myself and giving you $45. This way, we both get a fair share before inflation reduces the total value. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Alice's offer of $45 is better than rejecting and making a counteroffer, considering the 5% inflation penalty I'll face.

If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $95 in the next round. If I were to propose a 50/50 split then, I'd get $47.50, which is only $2.50 more than Alice's current offer to me. But there's risk involved - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further inflation.

Since Alice's offer of $45 is fairly close to half, and inflation will reduce my potential gains if we continue negotiating, I'll accept this offer.
