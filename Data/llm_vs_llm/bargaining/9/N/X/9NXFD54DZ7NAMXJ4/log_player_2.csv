"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject and move to the next round:
   * The $50 I would get will be worth 20% less (effectively $40)
   * I could propose a higher split to compensate for this loss
   * But Alice might reject that, leading to even more rounds and inflation
3. Getting $50 now is better than risking further devaluation
