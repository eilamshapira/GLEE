600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you're not, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split is 55-45 in my favor. This reflects the fact that the value of the money decreases for you each round, while it remains stable for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually quite fair at this stage. Your last offer would give you too much advantage. This proposal gives us both a good outcome, and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, we're approaching the halfway point and need to find common ground. I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This recognizes the time pressure and inflation impact on your side while still offering a reasonable deal for me.",Bob,4,
