"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you're not, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split is 55-45 in my favor. This reflects the fact that the value of the money decreases for you each round, while it remains stable for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 55-45 split in Bob's favor is too aggressive given we're only in round 2. While I am affected by inflation, at this early stage the effect is still relatively small (only 10% so far), and there's no reason for such a large swing in Bob's favor. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually quite fair at this stage. Your last offer would give you too much advantage. This proposal gives us both a good outcome, and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're approaching the halfway point and need to find common ground. I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This recognizes the time pressure and inflation impact on your side while still offering a reasonable deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because it's a reasonable compromise. While it's still in Bob's favor, the split is more moderate than his previous offer, and with inflation already at 27.1%, further delays would significantly reduce my effective gains. Getting 475,000 now is better than risking further rounds where inflation will continue to erode my share's value."
