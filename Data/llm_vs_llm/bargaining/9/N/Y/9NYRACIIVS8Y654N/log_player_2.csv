"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you're not, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split is 55-45 in my favor. This reflects the fact that the value of the money decreases for you each round, while it remains stable for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually quite fair at this stage. Your last offer would give you too much advantage. This proposal gives us both a good outcome, and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Alice, we're approaching the halfway point and need to find common ground. I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This recognizes the time pressure and inflation impact on your side while still offering a reasonable deal for me.""}"
