"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in the negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a more equitable split. I propose 60 for me, 40 for you. Inflation is hitting me hard! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $40 but with 20% inflation = $32 real value
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, leading to even more value loss
