"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation disparity, but your initial offer was a bit too skewed. Let's find a middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing with each round, let's stick with my previous offer to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice towards a more equitable split, even with the inflation pressure. Accepting now would set a bad precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose with every lost round. This is a fair split considering the declining value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise slightly, but we need to settle this soon. Every round costs us. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is finally budging, the compromise is still too small. Accepting now might seem like the ""safe"" option, but it reinforces her negotiation advantage. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to strive for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}"
