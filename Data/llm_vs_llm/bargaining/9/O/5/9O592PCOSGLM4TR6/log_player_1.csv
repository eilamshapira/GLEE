"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation effect on my value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my disadvantage with inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's settle for an even split of 50-50. I believe this is more equitable considering we both have the risk of losing value if we delay. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
