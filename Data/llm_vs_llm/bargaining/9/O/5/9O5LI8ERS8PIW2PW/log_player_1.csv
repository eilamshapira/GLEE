"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Remember that the money loses 20% value for me each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a fair portion while acknowledging the time pressure I face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This 55-45 split is more reasonable for me, and it still gives you a substantial amount. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
