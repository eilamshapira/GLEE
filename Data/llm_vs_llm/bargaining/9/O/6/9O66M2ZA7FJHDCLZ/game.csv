60.0,40.0,"To make it worthwhile considering inflation for me, let's split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5.0,95.0,"Alice, I know waiting hurts more for you due to inflation. Accept this offer now to secure your $5 (worth 80% of its face value in this round) rather than risking an even steeper loss later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,Let's be fair and split it in a way that's reasonable for both of us considering the inflation impact on me. How about 40 for me and 60 for you?,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, any further delay only worsens the value of your share. In round 5, your advantage as proposer evaporates because you'll have to hand nearly all the money to Bob to persuade him, given his non-discounted position. Accept $1 now (worth about 51 cents in round‑1 value) rather than risking a zero payoff later.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Given the situation with inflation, I propose 30 for me and 70 for you. This is fairer considering how the reduced value affects my share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of the money you receive—in round 6 your dollars are worth only about 32.8% of their original value. If you reject now, you step into round 7 with an even harsher discount, leaving you virtually empty-handed despite any proposal you might make. I’m offering you $1, which is more than what you could credibly secure if we delay any further. Accept this offer to salvage what little value remains.",Bob,6,
