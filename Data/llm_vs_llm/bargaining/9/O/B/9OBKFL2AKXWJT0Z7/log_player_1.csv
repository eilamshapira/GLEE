"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer in this first round, considering the 5% inflation penalty for each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and accepting now avoids any loss of value due to inflation in future rounds."
