500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both walk away with a good amount. Inflation does not affect me, but I understand it affects you. So I think this should be reasonable for both parties.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, since inflation affects me by 5% each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $580K now is worth only $522K in round 1 value due to 10% cumulative inflation. This makes our split more equitable in real terms.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to meet in the middle. This offer considers your inflation concerns while also being fair to me. Let's settle on this and avoid further rounds where we risk getting nothing.",Bob,4,
