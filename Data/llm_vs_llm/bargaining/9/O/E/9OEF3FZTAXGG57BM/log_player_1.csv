"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get slightly more since inflation affects me by 5% each round. This way we can both walk away with a good amount right now without risking value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both walk away with a good amount. Inflation does not affect me, but I understand it affects you. So I think this should be reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Given that inflation affects me by 5% per round, and this is round 2, the $500,000 offered to me is actually worth only $475,000 in round 1 terms. Since Bob isn't affected by inflation, he's actually getting a better deal. I should try to negotiate for a higher share to compensate for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Bob, since inflation affects me by 5% each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $580K now is worth only $522K in round 1 value due to 10% cumulative inflation. This makes our split more equitable in real terms.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet in the middle. This offer considers your inflation concerns while also being fair to me. Let's settle on this and avoid further rounds where we risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): While this isn't ideal, I should accept this offer because:
1. The 550K offered now is worth about 471.5K in round 1 terms (due to 14.26% inflation)
2. If we continue negotiating, the inflation will keep reducing my real gains
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12
4. Bob has shown some movement from his initial 50-50 split
5. This is close to my original proposal, and continuing might lead to worse outcomes"
