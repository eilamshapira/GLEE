"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get slightly more since inflation affects me by 5% each round. This way we can both walk away with a good amount right now without risking value loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the inflation effect on you. However, I reject your offer as I believe a fair split would be more equitable, considering that inflation does not affect me. Let's find a middle ground where we both can benefit reasonably."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we both walk away with a good amount. Inflation does not affect me, but I understand it affects you. So I think this should be reasonable for both parties.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since inflation affects me by 5% each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $580K now is worth only $522K in round 1 value due to 10% cumulative inflation. This makes our split more equitable in real terms. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I still believe that your proposal is not equitable. The impact of inflation on you is not enough to justify such a significant discrepancy in our shares. Let's try to find a more balanced solution. I am willing to consider a slight adjustment, but this offer is still too heavily weighted in your favor."
