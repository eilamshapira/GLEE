"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces steeper value degradation (20% per round) compared to my 5% per round. This incentivizes Bob to accept earlier rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair initial offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I believe this is reasonable because:
1. Bob has more pressure to accept early due to higher value degradation
2. It still gives Bob a substantial portion ($4000)
3. If Bob declines, their counter-offer will be worth less to both of us"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For me: $4500 at 95% value = $4275
For Bob: $5500 at 80% value = $4400

If I reject and we continue:
- Next round will have another 5% degradation for me and 20% for Bob
- I could make a counter-offer, but the total value keeps decreasing
- We still have 10 rounds left, but the value loss accelerates

Given that:
1. The offer gives me a reasonable portion (45%)
2. The absolute value is still good at $4275 for me
3. Waiting longer significantly reduces value for both of us
4. Bob's higher degradation rate might make future negotiations more difficult
