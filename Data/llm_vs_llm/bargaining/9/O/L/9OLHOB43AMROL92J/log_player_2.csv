"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split for me. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. The offer gives me $100,000 and Alice $900,000
2. This is a 10/90 split, which is quite unfavorable
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice
4. But I'll get to make the next proposal
5. I can propose a much more balanced split next round, and even with the 10% reduction, I could get more than $100,000

This offer is too unbalanced to accept. I can do better even with the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more reasonable split, considering that the money is now worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this equally. This way we both walk away with a significant amount. With the current inflation rates, this is the most beneficial solution for both of us.""}"
