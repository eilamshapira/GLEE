"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split that gives Bob a substantial portion of the money. Given that Bob's money devalues more quickly than mine (20% vs 5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than going to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can potentially make a better counteroffer in the next round. Given the inflation rates, I need to carefully consider the actual values for both of us in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing inflation impact on both parties, I'll make a more favorable offer to encourage Bob to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine (20% per round versus my 5%), I'm offering him a better deal than my initial proposal. For Bob, accepting now would be better than continuing to the next round where his share would be worth even less. This should be a rational compromise for both of us."
