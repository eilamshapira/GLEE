"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 of the $10,000, while keeping $6,000 for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I need to factor in the 20% inflation penalty that would apply to my share.

If I reject and move to the next round, the total pot would effectively be worth $8,000 to me (due to 20% inflation) and $9,500 to Alice (due to 5% inflation).

Since I can make a better proposal in the next round and the inflation affects Alice less severely than me, I should carefully consider whether rejection makes sense strategically.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation differences between us.

Since we're now in round 2, I need to consider that any further delay will result in significant depreciation of my share (20% per round) compared to Alice's (5% per round). This creates an incentive for me to propose a reasonable split that Alice will accept now.

Given that Alice initially proposed a 40/60 split, I'll offer a balanced proposal that's slightly better for her than what I'd get if we went another round with inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer in light of the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 while keeping $5,500 for herself. Due to inflation, my $4,500 is worth 36% less than it would have been in round 1, making it equivalent to about $2,880 of original value. Alice's $5,500 is worth 9.75% less, equivalent to about $4,964 of original value.

If I reject and move to round 4, I'll face 20% more inflation (total 56% loss from original value), while Alice would face only 5% more (total 14.75% loss). This asymmetric inflation puts me at a significant disadvantage if we continue to future rounds.

Alice has improved her offer from the initial $4,000, and given the inflation penalty I face, this is likely better than what I could achieve in further rounds.
