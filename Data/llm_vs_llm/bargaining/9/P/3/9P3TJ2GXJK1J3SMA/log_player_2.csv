Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the inflation. Remember, for me, the value of money decreases by 10% each round. I need to factor that in. Since Alice went first and asked for a hefty 60, I'll aim for a more favorable split, but still leave her enough to hopefully accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's think this through. Alice is still aiming for a majority share. With inflation hitting me harder now (19% less value), 45 might not be enough to compensate for the risk of further rounds. I'll accept this offer, as it seems better than risking further losses.
