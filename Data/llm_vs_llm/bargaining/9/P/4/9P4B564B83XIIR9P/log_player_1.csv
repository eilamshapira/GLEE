"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52.63, ""bob_gain"": 47.37, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $52.63 and you get $47.37. If you decline, you become the proposer next round but the total value will drop by 10%. I believe this division fairly reflects our future prospects under discounting. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I suggest we split the money equally to avoid further devaluation. This way, we both get a fair share and don't risk losing more value over subsequent rounds. Let's agree on $50 each. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
