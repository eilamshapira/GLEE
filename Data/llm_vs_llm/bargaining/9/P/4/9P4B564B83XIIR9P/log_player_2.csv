"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $52.63 and you get $47.37. If you decline, you become the proposer next round but the total value will drop by 10%. I believe this division fairly reflects our future prospects under discounting. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
