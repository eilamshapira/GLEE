"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is offering me $473,684 (47.4%) while keeping $526,316 (52.6%) for herself. It's slightly in her favor, but not dramatically so.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 10% to $900,000. To come out ahead, I would need to secure a significantly better percentage of the smaller pie.

This is actually a pretty fair initial offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of value loss due to inflation makes this a reasonable deal to take.
