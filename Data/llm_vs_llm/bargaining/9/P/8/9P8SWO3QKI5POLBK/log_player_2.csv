"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally to ensure a fair and quick conclusion to the game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of the $10,000, where I would get $5,000. 

While this is a fair offer, I need to remember that if I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation on my portion, meaning the $10,000 pot would be worth only $9,500 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a perfect split in the next round, I could get $4,750 (half of $9,500).

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially less in the future round, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, accepting this equal division is the rational choice.
