"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 55, you get 45. It's a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. The split is slightly in Alice's favor (55/45)
3. There's no inflation penalty in this round
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
5. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice's decisions

While the offer isn't exactly 50/50, it's reasonably fair. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds, and there's always the risk of the negotiation breaking down.
