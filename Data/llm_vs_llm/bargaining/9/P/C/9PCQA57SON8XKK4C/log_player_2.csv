"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get an equal share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to consider this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'd get to make an offer, but the total money would be worth 5% less (only $9,500 total). Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more devaluation.

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now guarantees me $5,000 without risking further devaluation.
