"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which means I would get $5,000. This is a fair division that gives each of us an equal share. Since there's no inflation for me in future rounds (the money is worth 0% less with each passing round), there's no strategic advantage for me to delay and make a counter-proposal.
