"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer that acknowledges both parties need to benefit while accounting for potential inflation risks.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives both parties a substantial portion
2. It provides me some buffer against the 20% inflation penalty if negotiations extend
3. It's not so extreme that it would likely trigger an immediate rejection"
