"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but 60/40 is too skewed. How about a 52/48 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer is still not as favorable as I'd like, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less in each round, and this is the third round, his gain will be worth approximately 5% * 2 = 10% less than the original value (assuming the inflation effect is cumulative).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's revisit the split. How about 58/42?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This inflation is hurting both of us. I'm willing to settle for a bit less, but 58/42 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at 53/47. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more significantly now (14.26% less), and his offer of 53/47 is closer to my initial proposal, I'll consider accepting it to avoid further inflation effects on Bob's gain, which might lead to an even less favorable split in the next round.
