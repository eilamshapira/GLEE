Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's revisit the split. How about 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. While she might be experiencing it too, she's not acknowledging it in her proposals. I need to push for a better split."
