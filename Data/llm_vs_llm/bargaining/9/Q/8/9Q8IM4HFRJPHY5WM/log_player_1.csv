Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I get $6000 while you receive $4000. I believe this distribution is a strong starting point for our negotiations, and I'm open to discussion if you feel there's room for improvement. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial proposal. I think the fairest approach would be an equal split of $5000 each. This reflects equal partnership in our negotiation and ensures we both walk away with the same amount. I hope this seems reasonable to you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
