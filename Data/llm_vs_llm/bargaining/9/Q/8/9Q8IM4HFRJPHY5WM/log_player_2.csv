"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I get $6000 while you receive $4000. I believe this distribution is a strong starting point for our negotiations, and I'm open to discussion if you feel there's room for improvement. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $4,000 while she takes $6,000 out of the total $10,000.

While I could accept this offer now, I think there's room for a more balanced split. We have several rounds remaining, so I can make a counter-proposal. If I reject, I'll be able to make the next offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial proposal. I think the fairest approach would be an equal split of $5,000 each. This reflects equal partnership in our negotiation and ensures we both walk away with the same amount. I hope this seems reasonable to you.""}"
