90.0,10.0,"Bob, let's start strong. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Given the potential for inflation, securing a larger portion now benefits us both more than risking further devaluation of the money in later rounds. Let's get this done!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's make this fair and easy for both of us with a 50/50 split. This way, we can each benefit equally without inflation concerns. What do you think?",Bob,2,

75.0,25.0,"Bob, okay, let's compromise. I'll take 75 and you get 25. Remember the inflation hitting me harder with each round. This is a reasonable offer to account for that and for your patience.",Alice,3,
