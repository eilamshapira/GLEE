"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start strong. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Given the potential for inflation, securing a larger portion now benefits us both more than risking further devaluation of the money in later rounds. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's make this fair and easy for both of us with a 50/50 split. This way, we can each benefit equally without inflation concerns. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, okay, let's compromise. I'll take 75 and you get 25. Remember the inflation hitting me harder with each round. This is a reasonable offer to account for that and for your patience. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75
