"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a reasonable division that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial amount. Given that inflation affects me by 10% each round, I want to secure a good deal now rather than risk a lower effective amount in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, inflation is working against me more severely (10% per round) than it is for Bob (5% per round). If I reject and we go to another round, my future gains would be worth even less. $450,000 now is better than potentially less effective value in a future round."
