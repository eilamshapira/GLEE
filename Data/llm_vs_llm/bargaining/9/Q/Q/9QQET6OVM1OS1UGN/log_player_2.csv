"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but I'll be affected by 5% inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I need to factor in that 5% reduction in value. This means I would need to secure more than $421,053 in the next round to make rejecting worthwhile ($400,000 ÷ 0.95 ≈ $421,053).

Since I can make the offer in the next round, I think I can propose a more favorable split for myself. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Since I rejected her initial 40/60 split, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives me $550,000, which is significantly better than the $400,000 Alice offered even after accounting for the 5% inflation. I'm offering Alice a substantial $450,000, which is still a large portion of the total amount and should be appealing enough to accept rather than face another round of negotiation."
