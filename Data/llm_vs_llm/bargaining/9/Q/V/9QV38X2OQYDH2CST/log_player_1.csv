"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is reasonable as the first mover while still being quite fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30.85 
# Bob gain: 69.15 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfair - Bob is trying to take almost 70% of the money. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would benefit both of us more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering we're now dealing with a 20% total inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is completely fair to both parties, and given the mounting inflation penalties, it would be rational for Bob to accept this offer. At this point, both of us would get more value by agreeing to a fair split than by continuing to negotiate and losing more value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's quite reasonable and fair, and with the mounting inflation penalty (27.1%), continuing to negotiate would likely result in both of us losing more value. Bob has moved to a much more balanced proposal compared to their previous offer, and the split is close enough to 50-50 to be acceptable."
