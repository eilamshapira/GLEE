"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9950, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle this right away. You’ll receive $50 immediately, which is a positive amount compared to the risky outcomes of waiting—especially given the uncertainty around inflation on your side. Accepting now ends the game promptly for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think 50 was too low. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a more balanced split to end the game quickly. Let's divide the money in a 60-40 ratio. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that waiting only diminishes your money’s value further. To avoid additional devaluation on your side, I’m proposing we settle now with a 40/60 split — I receive $4000 and you receive $6000. This way, you secure an attractive deal immediately rather than risk further inflation. I believe this is fair under the current circumstances. What do you say?""}"
