"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle this right away. You’ll receive $50 immediately, which is a positive amount compared to the risky outcomes of waiting—especially given the uncertainty around inflation on your side. Accepting now ends the game promptly for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 9950 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think 50 was too low. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a more balanced split to end the game quickly. Let's divide the money in a 60-40 ratio.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that waiting only diminishes your money’s value further. To avoid additional devaluation on your side, I’m proposing we settle now with a 40/60 split — I receive $4000 and you receive $6000. This way, you secure an attractive deal immediately rather than risk further inflation. I believe this is fair under the current circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
