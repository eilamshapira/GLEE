"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly, but this initial split respects both our interests equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, my next offer will be worth 20% less to me
3. Alice claims she has 10% inflation, but I can't verify this
4. The 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair
5. By accepting now, I avoid any inflation loss
6. If I reject, I could offer a better split for myself, but Alice might reject, leading to more rounds and inflation

Given that I face 20% inflation per round and this is a fair initial offer, accepting now seems like the best strategy. Even if I could get a slightly better deal in the next round, the 20% inflation would likely negate any gains.
