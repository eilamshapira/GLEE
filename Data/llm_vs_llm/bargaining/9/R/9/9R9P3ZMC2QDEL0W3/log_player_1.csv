Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this now to avoid further inflation reducing our gains.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a sizable portion to end this quickly.  I need a bit more than your previous offer to make it worthwhile for me. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to expedite our deal given the inflation risks. Accepting 450,000 for me (with 10% depreciation in round 2) is preferable to further delays. Let's settle this deal now.""}"
