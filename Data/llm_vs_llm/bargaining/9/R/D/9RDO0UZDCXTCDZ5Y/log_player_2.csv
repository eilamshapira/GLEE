Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. While I don't want to drag this out indefinitely and risk losing more value, I need to push for a better split."

I'm willing to concede a bit, but I need a larger share than Alice offered last round."
