"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to divide the $100. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a fair and common starting point for negotiations.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of Bob's offer.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, but its value will be 20% less, so the actual value for me will be:
$40 * 0.8 = $32

Considering this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal, as $32 is a significant decrease from the initial 50-50 split I proposed.

My response:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and we're already in the third round, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob to try to end the game quickly.

The initial $100 is now worth less to me due to two rounds of inflation (20% less each round):
$100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64

However, for Bob, the value decreased by 10% in the second round:
$100 * 0.9 = $90

I'll propose a split that takes into account the decreased value for me and tries to find a mutually acceptable agreement.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground and settle this before more value is lost.""
}
```"
