"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of $500000. Since there's no inflation on my end, I can negotiate patiently, but I'm offering this even split in good faith to reach a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk further inflation reducing the value of my potential gain.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
