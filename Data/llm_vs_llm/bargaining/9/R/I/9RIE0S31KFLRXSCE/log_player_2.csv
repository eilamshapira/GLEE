"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed that she gets 60% ($600,000) while I get 40% ($400,000) of the $1,000,000. 

While this isn't an even split, $400,000 is still a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation for me between rounds, I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could potentially give me leverage in negotiations.

I think I'll reject this offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of $500,000. Since there's no inflation on my end, I can negotiate patiently, but I'm offering this even split in good faith to reach a quick resolution.""}"
