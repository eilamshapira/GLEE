"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the $1000000 evenly so we both walk away happy and fair. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

In round 1, there's no inflation effect yet. The offer is for a 50-50 split, which means I would get $500,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, my share would need to be significantly higher to offset the 5% inflation loss. Even if I proposed a more favorable split, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation impact on my gains.

A 50-50 split in round 1 is actually quite fair, and avoiding inflation makes this a solid offer. There's also risk in rejection since we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.
