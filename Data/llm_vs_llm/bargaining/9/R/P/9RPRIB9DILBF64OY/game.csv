60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $60 and you get $40. Accepting this offer now gives us both the full value of the money, and waiting might reduce the overall benefit. I believe this is fair—let's both walk away happy.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's split it 55/45. This is more fair considering the risk of further inflation on my end. It gives us both a good deal.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the proposal doesn't work for me. While my share remains unaffected by inflation, I believe that waiting another round—where I can propose a division—could secure a better result given that your share continues to be discounted. Let's proceed to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, in this round I'm proposing a split where I receive $99 and you get $1. I recognize that while this looks lopsided, remember that any future proposals will further erode the value of your share due to inflation on your end. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round, but you'll be forced to offer me almost everything in order for me to accept—leaving you with effectively nothing. Accepting $1 now is strictly better than that outcome. Let's wrap this up efficiently.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation, but 99/1 is absurd. Let's split it 50/50. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's still worth something for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while a 50/50 split might seem fair at first glance, I believe that given the current dynamics—where my share retains its full value and yours suffers further from inflation—a better outcome awaits if we proceed. In round 5 I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division that reflects these realities, and it should end up favoring me even more, while leaving you with less in effective value. I’d prefer we continue to round 5 rather than settle on this division.",Alice,4,reject
98.0,2.0,"Bob, here's my proposal for round 5: I take $98 while you receive $2. The inflation that diminishes the value of your share only gets worse with each round. Accepting this offer now protects you from further devaluation—your $2 is worth more than what you’d effectively get down the road, and waiting gives me the chance to secure an even more lopsided split in my favor. I believe this is the smartest move for both of us. Please accept.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
60.0,40.0,"Alice, I'm heavily impacted by inflation. I'll take $40 if you take $60. It's better than nothing for me, and still a good deal for you since your money isn't losing value.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation on your side, but by rejecting this offer, I can propose a division in the next round that takes even greater advantage of the devaluation you’re facing. My share remains undiminished while your value keeps dropping, so waiting lets me secure a much more favorable split for myself. I believe it’s in both our interests to continue to round 7, where I can propose terms that reflect this reality.",Alice,6,reject
97.0,3.0,"Bob, here's my proposal for round 7: I take $97 and you get $3. With every additional round you face increased devaluation of your share while mine remains constant. If you reject this offer, waiting another round will only worsen the relative value of your portion, leaving you with even less in real terms. Accepting $3 now is a safeguard against further losses. I believe this is the most equitable solution given the inflationary pressure on your side.",Alice,7,
