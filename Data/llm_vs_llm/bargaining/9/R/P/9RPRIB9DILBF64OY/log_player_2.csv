"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $60 and you get $40. Accepting this offer now gives us both the full value of the money, and waiting might reduce the overall benefit. I believe this is fair—let's both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's split it 55/45. This is more fair considering the risk of further inflation on my end. It gives us both a good deal.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round I'm proposing a split where I receive $99 and you get $1. I recognize that while this looks lopsided, remember that any future proposals will further erode the value of your share due to inflation on your end. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round, but you'll be forced to offer me almost everything in order for me to accept—leaving you with effectively nothing. Accepting $1 now is strictly better than that outcome. Let's wrap this up efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation, but 99/1 is absurd. Let's split it 50/50. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's still worth something for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for round 5: I take $98 while you receive $2. The inflation that diminishes the value of your share only gets worse with each round. Accepting this offer now protects you from further devaluation—your $2 is worth more than what you’d effectively get down the road, and waiting gives me the chance to secure an even more lopsided split in my favor. I believe this is the smartest move for both of us. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I'm heavily impacted by inflation. I'll take $40 if you take $60. It's better than nothing for me, and still a good deal for you since your money isn't losing value.""
}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for round 7: I take $97 and you get $3. With every additional round you face increased devaluation of your share while mine remains constant. If you reject this offer, waiting another round will only worsen the relative value of your portion, leaving you with even less in real terms. Accepting $3 now is a safeguard against further losses. I believe this is the most equitable solution given the inflationary pressure on your side. 
# Bob gain: 3 
# Alice gain: 97
