"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll approach this game strategically considering the 5% inflation that affects me each round.

Given that inflation only affects my payoff, I should offer a fair split that Bob is likely to accept to avoid devaluation of my share.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests and avoids the inflation penalty."
