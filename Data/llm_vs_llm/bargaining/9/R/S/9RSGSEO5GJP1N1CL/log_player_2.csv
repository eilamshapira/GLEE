"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is fair at face value
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   * A $50 offer now would be worth more than any amount in the next round
   * For example, $60 in the next round would only be worth $48 due to inflation
4. Since this is a fair offer and inflation will reduce my purchasing power, it's better to accept now
