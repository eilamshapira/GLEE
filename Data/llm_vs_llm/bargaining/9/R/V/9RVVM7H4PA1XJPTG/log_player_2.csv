"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which would give me $5000. That's equal on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. So waiting would reduce the effective value of my share.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and inflation will reduce my value in future rounds, I should accept.
