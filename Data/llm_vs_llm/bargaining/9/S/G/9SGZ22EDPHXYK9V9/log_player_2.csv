"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for a starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. If we go to next round, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
4. 450,000$ is a substantial amount, and with 5% inflation risk, waiting could cost me 22,500$
5. The split is relatively fair (55/45)

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation risk and that the offer is reasonably fair, I'll accept.
