"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor, with a brief explanation to Bob: ""Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair offer that gives you a solid $400,000 now rather than a diminished value in future rounds."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $520,000 × 0.9 = $468,000 (in round 1 value)
   * Bob gets $480,000 × 0.8 = $384,000 (in round 1 value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even more inflation
   * I'll get another chance to make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less than round 1
   * Bob's will be worth 40% less than round 1

Since I'm still getting a decent amount that's worth more than a potential future round, and Bob has made a reasonable counteroffer...
