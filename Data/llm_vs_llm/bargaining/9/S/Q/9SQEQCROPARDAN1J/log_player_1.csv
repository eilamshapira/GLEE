"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 10% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer would give me $4,500 × 0.9 = $4,050 in effective value, which I believe is too low. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more moderate than my first proposal, while accounting for the fact that any money I receive is now worth only 81% of the original value due to two rounds of inflation (0.9 × 0.9 = 0.81). With this split, my effective gain would be $5,500 × 0.81 = $4,455, which is better than Bob's previous offer. This is a fair compromise that gives Bob a good portion while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with the 27.1% inflation penalty, I would effectively receive only $4,000 × 0.729 = $2,916, which is too low. While the inflation is making each round more costly for me, this offer is worse than the previous one, and I believe we can still reach a better agreement. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm increasing my requested share to offset the growing inflation effect (now at 0.9^4 = 0.6561, meaning I'm losing 34.39% of value). With this split, my effective gain would be $6,000 × 0.6561 = $3,937, which is reasonable considering the circumstances. I hope Bob understands that I need to request more nominal dollars to compensate for my inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with the 40.95% inflation penalty, I would effectively receive only $3,500 × 0.5905 = $2,067, which is getting very low. Even though we're now halfway through our rounds and the inflation penalty is severe, this offer is worse than previous ones. We still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe we can reach a better agreement. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I need to increase my requested share again to counteract the severe inflation effect (now at 0.9^6 = 0.531441, meaning I'm losing 46.86% of value). With this split, my effective gain would be $6,500 × 0.531441 = $3,454, which is necessary to maintain a reasonable value given my inflation penalty. I'm hoping Bob will understand that my higher nominal request is simply to offset my rapidly declining purchasing power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with the 52.17% inflation penalty, I would effectively receive only $3,000 × 0.4783 = $1,435, which is extremely low. Even though we're getting closer to the end and my inflation penalty is severe, this declining trend in offers is concerning. With 4 rounds remaining, I'll make another counter-offer hoping to reach a more equitable agreement. The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 is increasing, but this offer is too low to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I must increase my requested share significantly now because the inflation effect is severe (0.9^8 = 0.430467, meaning I'm losing 56.95% of value). With this split, my effective gain would be $7,000 × 0.430467 = $3,013. This might seem like a high nominal request, but it's necessary just to maintain a reasonable effective value given my harsh inflation penalty. Bob needs to understand that each round makes my position much worse, while we don't know how inflation affects him. I hope he recognizes that this request is fair given my circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, with only 2 rounds remaining and the risk of getting nothing, I need to be pragmatic. With the 61.26% inflation penalty, I would receive $2,500 × 0.3874 = $968.50. If I reject, my next counter-offer would be worth even less due to inflation, and Bob seems to be consistently decreasing his offers. The risk of reaching round 12 and getting nothing is now too high. Better to secure some value than risk getting nothing."
