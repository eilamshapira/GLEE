"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's both walk away feeling good. I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. Fair deal to start with, right? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 55/45 split in her favor, giving me $450,000. With inflation affecting me at 10% per round, waiting would reduce the value of my money in future rounds.

Let me analyze my options:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, I risk Alice rejecting it, and my eventual gains would be worth less due to inflation

While the split isn't exactly equal, it's reasonably fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face with each round, accepting now seems prudent rather than risking further negotiation.
