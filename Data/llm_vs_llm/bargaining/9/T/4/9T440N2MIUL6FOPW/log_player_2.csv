Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. Inflation is affecting us both, and it's best to avoid further negotiation at this point.  This way we can each get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
