"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to incentivize me to agree quickly, avoiding inflation for both of us. Let's finish this deal now! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation penalty for me, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

My gain would be $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 to me.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation penalty, I'll make a new offer.

Due to two rounds passing, the money I gain is worth 10% * 2 = 20% less than in the first round, which is 0.8 of the original value. To account for this, I'll adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I've adjusted my offer to reflect the inflation penalty. Accept this, and we can both walk away with a reasonable amount.""}"
