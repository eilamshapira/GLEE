"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for the fact that Bob could counter-offer, but would face a 20% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable offer because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($450,000)
2. If Bob rejects and counter-offers in the next round, the total amount will be worth 20% less ($800,000), making it harder to achieve a better outcome
3. It's fair enough that it should be attractive to accept rather than risk further negotiation"
