"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the reduced value of the money. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* My 4500$ is worth 20% less due to inflation, so it's actually worth 3600$
* If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount will be worth 40% less for me
* My previous offer of 6000$ would only be worth 3600$ in the next round
* This offer gives me 3600$ in effective value now

Since rejecting would lead to even worse outcomes due to the increasing inflation penalty, and this offer gives me the same effective value as my initial proposal would be worth in the next round, I should accept.
