"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000 with Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me and the limited number of rounds. To maximize my potential gain, I will make a relatively aggressive offer, but one that still gives Bob a significant amount to incentivize acceptance.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and Bob's offer.

*   **My Perspective:** My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1, so $1 received now is equivalent to $1.05 from Round 1.

*   **Bob's Offer:** $450,000 for me.

I need to decide if $450,000 (with the 5% inflation factored in) is better than what I think I can get in future rounds, considering the increasing inflation. Bob also suffers from inflation, so he might offer less if I reject.

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer considering the inflation: $450,000 is equivalent to 450000 / 1.05 = 428571.43 from round 1.

Given the limited rounds and the inflation, Bob's offer, while not ideal, gives me a guaranteed amount. While I could try to negotiate for more in future rounds, inflation will continue to eat into the value. Considering the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
