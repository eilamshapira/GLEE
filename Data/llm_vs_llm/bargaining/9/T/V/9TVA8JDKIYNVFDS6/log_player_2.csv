"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me 40% of the total, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice, which gives me some negotiating advantage. I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges inflation and presents a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined value before further inflation affects us both."
