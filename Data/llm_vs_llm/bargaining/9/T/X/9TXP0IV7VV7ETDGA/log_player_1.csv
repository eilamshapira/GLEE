Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face 10% depreciation and I face 5%, this split is actually favorable for you. If you reject, your next round will be worth significantly less, making this a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
