"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers me $400,000 and takes $600,000
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * The total value decreases 5% for me (I'd have $950,000 to split)
   * The total value decreases 10% for Alice (She'd have $900,000 to split)
3. This gives me leverage in the next round, as Alice has more to lose
4. I could propose a more favorable split in the next round
5. Even with my 5% loss, I'd still have room to negotiate a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Alice faces 10% depreciation while I face 5%, giving me leverage
2. If Alice rejects, she'll only have $900,000 worth of value to split next round
3. I should propose a more favorable split for me, but not too extreme to avoid rejection
4. A 55-45 split in my favor seems reasonable given the inflation dynamics

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that you face 10% depreciation and I face 5%, this split is actually favorable for you. If you reject, your next round will be worth significantly less, making this a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer takes into account the cumulative effects of inflation. It's a fair split considering the depreciation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Currently offered: $460,000 (worth 90.25% of original value â‰ˆ $415,150 in round 1 terms)
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I'll face 14.75% depreciation (another 5%)
   * Alice will face 29% depreciation (another 10%)
   * The difference in our depreciation rates is becoming more significant
3. However, Alice's offer has improved from her first proposal
4. The inflation gap is working in my favor, but prolonging negotiations hurts both of us
5. This offer is reasonably fair given the current circumstances and the risk of further depreciation
