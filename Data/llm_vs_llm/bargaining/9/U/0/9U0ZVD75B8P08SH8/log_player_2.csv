"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering this offer, I'm being offered exactly half of the total amount, which is 5000$. This is a fair split in principle. However, I need to be aware of the inflation factor. If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the whole 10,000$ would only be worth 9,500$ from my perspective.

If I were to get a perfect deal in the next round (hypothetically all 10,000$), it would still only be worth 9,500$ to me due to inflation. Since 5,000$ now is greater than any realistic amount I could get in the next round after accounting for inflation, I should accept this offer.
