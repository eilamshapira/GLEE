"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because getting a fair share now is better than risking value loss through inflation in subsequent rounds. I offer Bob a substantial amount to make it attractive enough to accept rather than risk losing value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 with 5% inflation = $427,500 effective value
2. If I reject, next round I can make another offer, but I'll face 10% total inflation
3. Even if I propose a better split next round, Bob might reject again, leading to more inflation losses

Given that the inflation only affects my portion and not Bob's, and the risk of losing more value in future rounds, I should accept this offer now.
