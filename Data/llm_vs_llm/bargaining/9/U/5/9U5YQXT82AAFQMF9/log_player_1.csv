"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that's appealing enough for Bob to accept, considering the risk of inflation on my end.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation:

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a significant portion of the total. This gives him a strong incentive to accept the offer right away, as he avoids any potential losses from future rounds. I am keeping $6,000 for myself, which I believe is a fair amount given the initial amount and the risk of inflation. I hope that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing to give me $4000 while he takes $6000. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains if I reject this offer.

If I accept, I get $4000. However, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so it is worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 from my perspective compared to round 1.

If I reject, I risk further inflation in the next round. I need to evaluate the likelihood of getting a better offer later. Given that Bob is proposing a division that heavily favors him, it is hard to imagine that he will offer more in the future.

Considering the inflation and Bob's relatively greedy offer, I will accept to avoid further losses.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
