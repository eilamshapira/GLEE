"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how this plays out in the next round. Alice is losing value faster than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option, and given the inflation, it's in Alice's best interest to accept now before the value decreases further."
