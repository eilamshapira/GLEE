"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my proposal, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation: I'm asking for a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. This gives me a better chance of securing a decent amount despite the shrinking value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Original amounts:** Alice gets $5000, Bob gets $5000.
*   **Inflation for Alice:** My money is worth 5% less, so $5000 is effectively worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 in round 1 dollars.
*   **Inflation for Bob:** Bob's money is worth 10% less, so $5000 is effectively worth $5000 * 0.90 = $4500 in round 1 dollars.

Since I proposed $6000 initially, and this offer is effectively $4750, I'm still losing out significantly.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I need to adjust my strategy considering the rejections and continued inflation.

*   **Inflation:** My money is now worth 10% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's rejection:** He clearly wants a bigger piece of the pie than I initially offered, even though he is also experiencing inflation.

To try and secure a deal, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob, but still try to account for my losses due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750
}
```"
