Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This gives you a substantial amount, and avoids us losing money to inflation in later rounds. Let's lock this in!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a more even split is in order. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose this division to avoid further losses. Let's settle on this! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
