"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I hope we can agree on this! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This isn't an equal split, but I should keep in mind that:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer
2. However, the total amount decreases by 10% each round (so next round we'd be dividing $9,000)
3. We only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

Since I can make a counter-offer next round, and the penalty isn't too severe yet, I'll reject this offer as it's significantly in Alice's favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the decreasing value of our potential agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with the same amount, and we can avoid losing value through more rounds of negotiation.""}"
