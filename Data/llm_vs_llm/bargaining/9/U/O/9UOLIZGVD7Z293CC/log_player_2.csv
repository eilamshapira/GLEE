"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the $50 would only be worth $47.50 to me
4. Even if I could get a better split next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky
5. A guaranteed $50 now is better than a potentially higher but deflated amount later
