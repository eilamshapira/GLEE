"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me think strategically about this first offer. Given the different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for Bob), there's pressure to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, especially for me.

I'll propose a slightly favorable split to increase chances of acceptance while acknowledging Bob's stronger negotiating position due to the inflation difference.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money $55 for me and $45 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, and reaching an agreement now is better than letting inflation eat into our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. This offer means $45 for me, but due to 20% inflation, it's really worth $36 (45 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and we continue, subsequent rounds will be worth even less due to compounding inflation
3. Bob has a stronger position due to lower inflation impact (5% vs my 20%)
4. This split is actually quite reasonable considering the circumstances
5. Waiting for future rounds will only decrease the real value of any potential gains
