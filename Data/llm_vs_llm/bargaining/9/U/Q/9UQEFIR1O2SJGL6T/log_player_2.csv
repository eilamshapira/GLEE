"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

4000$ for me and 6000$ for Alice. While this isn't an even split, I should consider:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
2. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, the money will be worth 20% less for her
3. I have the advantage of a lower depreciation rate

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be 9000$ for me and 8000$ for Alice. I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is now worth less to both of us (90% of original value for me, 80% for Alice), I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This way I get 5500$ (worth 4950$ to me now) and Alice gets 4500$ (worth 3600$ to her now). If she rejects, the money will depreciate even more severely for her in the next round, so this should be an attractive offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

4500$ for me, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth 3645$ to me now.
5500$ for Alice, which due to 36% inflation is worth 3520$ to her now.

If I reject:
1. In the next round, my money will be worth 27.1% less than original
2. Alice's money will be worth 48.8% less than original
3. We're already in round 3 of 12, but the rapid depreciation for Alice means she should be motivated to reach a deal

Since Alice's current offer gives me less than my previous offer would have given me (4950$), and the split is still in her favor despite her having higher depreciation, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, money has depreciated significantly (27.1% for me, 48.8% for Alice). Given Alice's much higher depreciation rate, she should be more eager to reach a deal. I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but still gives her enough value to make it worth accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This means:
- I get 6000$ (worth 4374$ to me after 27.1% depreciation)
- Alice gets 4000$ (worth 2048$ to her after 48.8% depreciation)

If Alice rejects this, her next round depreciation will be even worse (59% from original value), so this should be an attractive offer despite the split being in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

4800$ for me, which due to 34.39% inflation is worth 3149$ to me now.
5200$ for Alice, which due to 59.04% inflation is worth 2130$ to her now.

The situation is getting worse for both of us:
1. We're now in round 5 of 12
2. Alice's depreciation is much more severe than mine
3. The next round will have even worse depreciation (41% for me, 67% for Alice)

While I could reject and push for a better deal, we're reaching a point where further delays significantly hurt both of us. This offer gives me a decent amount considering the depreciation, and the risk of getting less value in future rounds is increasing.
