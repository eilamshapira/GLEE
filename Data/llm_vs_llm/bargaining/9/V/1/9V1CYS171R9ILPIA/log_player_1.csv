"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept early due to my inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it, considering I face inflation penalties in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I reject and we go to round 3, any money I get will be worth another 20% less. Right now, my $45 share would be worth $36 (after 20% inflation). If I wait for round 3, even if I get a better nominal amount, it will be worth even less due to the compounding inflation effect.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds."
