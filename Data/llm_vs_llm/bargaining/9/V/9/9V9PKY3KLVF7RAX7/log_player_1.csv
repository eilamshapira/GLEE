"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer considering the asymmetric inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) than Bob's (5% per round), I should account for this difference.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this division because it recognizes the time pressure affects me more significantly. If we delay, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for me. This offer gives you a bit more than half, acknowledging the inflation asymmetry, while still being fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
