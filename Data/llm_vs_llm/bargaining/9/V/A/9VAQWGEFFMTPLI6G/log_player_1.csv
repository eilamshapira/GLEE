"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can avoid the 5% inflation penalty by accepting now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution, considering the inflation penalty. Let's avoid further rounds and reach a swift agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000, but with 5% inflation penalty, it's worth $427,500 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to increasing inflation
* Even if I managed to get $600,000 in the next round, it would be worth $540,000 to me
* Bob's offer is reasonable, and the inflation risk makes accepting now the better choice
