"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

If I accept now, I get $50.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, and Alice accepts that counter-offer, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me. Even if I proposed taking $60 in the next round and Alice accepted, I would get $60 Ã— 0.95 = $57.

Considering the inflation risk and the fact that a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
