"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice's offer is quite reasonable, giving me 55% of the total amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's share would be worth 5% less to her due to inflation. However, she might then reject my offer, leading to further rounds where both of us might end up with less value.

Given that:
1. The current offer gives me a majority share (5500$)
2. There's risk in prolonging negotiation
3. The offer seems fair and respects both parties
