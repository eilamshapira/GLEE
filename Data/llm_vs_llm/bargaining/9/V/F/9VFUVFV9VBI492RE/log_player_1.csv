"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for this disadvantage. This is still a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
