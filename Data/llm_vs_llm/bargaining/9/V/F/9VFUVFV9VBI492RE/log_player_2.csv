"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which would give me $500,000. While this seems fair at first glance, I need to remember that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round if I reject. However, if I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $500,000, but the total amount would be worth 10% less to me.

Let's analyze:
- Current offer: $500,000
- If I reject and propose a 60/40 split next round, I'd get $600,000, but with 10% inflation, that's worth $540,000 to me, which is better than the current offer.

Given this analysis, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.
