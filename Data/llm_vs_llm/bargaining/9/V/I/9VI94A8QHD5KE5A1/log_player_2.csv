I need to push for a better deal still. While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, getting to round 12 with no deal means I get nothing.  I have to balance risk and potential reward."

This is getting very risky, but I can't accept such a low amount.  Alice seems to be playing hardball, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the final rounds."

This is a risky move, but I need to signal that I'm serious about getting a larger share. The rapidly decreasing value of the money for me means I need to be bold."

It's painful to accept such a reduced amount, but the alternative is risking getting nothing at all. The inflation is killing my potential gains, and I can't afford to be too greedy anymore."
