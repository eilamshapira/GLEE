"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a split that considers both our interests and the impact of inflation:

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal now - I'm offering you $45. If we keep going, inflation will reduce both our shares.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I think this is a fair deal. If we delay, my loss will be greater than yours. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $43, at 95% value = $40.85 effective value
   * Bob gets $57, at 90% value = $51.30 effective value

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth even less (90% for me, 80% for Bob)
   * I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
   * Further delays hurt both of us

Since Bob's offer gives me a reasonable share and continuing would mean more value lost to inflation, I'll accept.
