500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, I know you value fairness, but time is not on our side – every moment you wait reduces the value of your share by 20%. Accepting this offer gives you a positive payout now, while a delay will leave you with nothing. Think carefully – it's in your best interest to accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing 400000 for me and 600000 for you. This way, you still get the majority, but I get a fair amount considering the diminishing value of money for me. Let's end this soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but remember that every round further devalues your share – in round 4, your money is worth just 51.2% of its original value. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but you'll hardly be able to claim anything since I can force nearly the entire amount when I'm in control. Accepting now guarantees you something rather than nothing. Please consider the severe cost of delay and accept this simple division.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
320000.0,680000.0,"Bob, with each round, my share loses more value. I'm offering 320000 for me and 680000 for you. This is still a good deal for you, and it's fair considering the inflation impact on my side. Let's settle this now before it gets worse.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every round you wait further erodes the value of your share – now in round 6 it's only worth about 32.8% of its face value. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 7, but you'll be forced to offer me nearly the entire amount to get my agreement, leaving you with virtually nothing. Accepting this offer, though it might seem small nominally, gives you a guaranteed positive payout compared to the harsh outcome waiting would bring. Please accept.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
256000.0,744000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and my share is now worth significantly less. I'm proposing 256000 for me and 744000 for you. This is your chance to end this with a substantial amount while still giving me something fair given the inflation. Let's not let this drag on any longer.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, in round 8 your money is now worth only about 20.97% of its original value. Waiting only worsens your position—in round 9, when you'll have the chance to propose, you'll be forced into an even less favorable situation given the accelerated devaluation. Accepting this offer guarantees you a positive payout now rather than risking almost nothing later. Please accept the division and end this swiftly.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
204800.0,795200.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire here. My share is now worth very little due to inflation. I'm offering 204800 for me and 795200 for you. This is your last chance to end this with a significant amount while still giving me something reasonable. Let's finish this now before it's too late.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, in round 10 your share is now worth only about 13.42% of its nominal value due to inflation. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 11, but you'll be forced to give me almost everything since I can promise nearly the whole 1000000 in round 12. Accepting this offer now guarantees you a positive payout—every dollar keeps some value, even if it's small. Please accept.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
163840.0,836160.0,"Bob, this is our second to last round. My share is now worth very little, but I'm still offering 163840 for me and 836160 for you. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's end this now before we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, this is the final round. At this point, your share is worth only about 8.59% of its nominal value. Rejecting this offer means we both walk away with nothing, while accepting guarantees you a positive, albeit minimal, payout. Rationally, even $1 is better than nothing. Please accept this division so we can conclude the game.",Bob,12,
