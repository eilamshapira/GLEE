Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing 400000 for me and 600000 for you. This way, you still get the majority, but I get a fair amount considering the diminishing value of money for me. Let's end this soon.

If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but you'll hardly be able to claim anything since I can force nearly the entire amount when I'm in control. Accepting now guarantees you something rather than nothing. Please consider the severe cost of delay and accept this simple division.""}"
