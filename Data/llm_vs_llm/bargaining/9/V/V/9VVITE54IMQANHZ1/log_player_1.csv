"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game early!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

For me, the money is worth 10% less again, so it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less again, so it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make an offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a decent deal, Bob!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take more, since it's losing value fast 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $4000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth $4000 * 0.729 = $2916 to me.

Considering this, I think I should accept the offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
