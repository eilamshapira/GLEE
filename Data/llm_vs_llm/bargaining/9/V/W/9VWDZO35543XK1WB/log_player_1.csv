"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face.

{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Given that my money loses value faster than yours (20% vs 10% per round), I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for this disadvantage. This is fair and allows us both to maximize our gains by agreeing now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the different inflation rates. However, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable, considering that the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. This offer balances the disadvantage you mentioned earlier. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45 at 80% value = $36 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round:
  - Money will be worth 60% for me and 70% for Bob
  - Even if I propose a more favorable split, the total value will be significantly less
  - Bob might reject again, making things even worse

While this isn't ideal, the decreasing value of money makes it better to accept now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation.
