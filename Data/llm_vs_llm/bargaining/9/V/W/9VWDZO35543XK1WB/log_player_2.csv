"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that my money loses value faster than yours (20% vs 10% per round), I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for this disadvantage. This is fair and allows us both to maximize our gains by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the different inflation rates. However, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable, considering that the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. This offer balances the disadvantage you mentioned earlier.""}"
