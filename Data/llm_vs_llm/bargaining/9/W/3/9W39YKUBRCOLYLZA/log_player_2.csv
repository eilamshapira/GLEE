"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60. If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% for me and 5% for Alice.

In the next round, the $100 would be worth only $80 to me due to 20% inflation. If I were to propose a more favorable split then, even if I asked for a higher amount, the actual value would be diminished.

While Alice's current offer gives me less than half, accepting now guarantees me $40 in full value rather than risking a lower effective value in future rounds due to the asymmetric inflation rates.
