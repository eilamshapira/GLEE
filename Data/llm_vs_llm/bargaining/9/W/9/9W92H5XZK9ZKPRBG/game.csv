53.0,47.0,"Alice, I know you want to end this quickly. But as we both know, further rounds will only erode the value of your portion due to inflation. Accepting my offer now secures you a nominal $53 (which, at current rates, is almost as good as your previous proposal) and avoids additional loss. Let's wrap this up on solid ground.",Bob,4,
