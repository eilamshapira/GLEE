Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since weâ€™re now in round 2, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Accepting now avoids further delays and any potential downsides from extended negotiation. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the turn in proposals.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you want to end this quickly. But as we both know, further rounds will only erode the value of your portion due to inflation. Accepting my offer now secures you a nominal $53 (which, at current rates, is almost as good as your previous proposal) and avoids additional loss. Let's wrap this up on solid ground. 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47
