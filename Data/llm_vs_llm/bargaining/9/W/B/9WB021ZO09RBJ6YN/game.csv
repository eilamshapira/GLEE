55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid the cost of delay for me. How about I get $55 and you get $45? Accepting now avoids the 20% depreciation on my share in future rounds. Let me know your thoughts!",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about delay costs, but your initial offer favored you too much. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I believe a more equitable split is appropriate. I'm proposing I get $52 and you get $48, which is still favorable to you compared to a 50/50 split considering I've already taken a hit from inflation. Let's settle this now to avoid further depreciation for both of us.",Bob,2,
