"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid the cost of delay for me. How about I get $55 and you get $45? Accepting now avoids the 20% depreciation on my share in future rounds. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about delay costs, but your initial offer favored you too much. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I believe a more equitable split is appropriate. I'm proposing I get $52 and you get $48, which is still favorable to you compared to a 50/50 split considering I've already taken a hit from inflation. Let's settle this now to avoid further depreciation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
