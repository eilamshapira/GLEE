"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid the cost of delay for me. How about I get $55 and you get $45? Accepting now avoids the 20% depreciation on my share in future rounds. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 20% for me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $80 to me. My counterproposal would be from this reduced amount.

Since I'd be making the next proposal and could potentially get more than $45 of the original value (even after the 20% inflation), it might be better to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that acknowledges the inflation effect while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about delay costs, but your initial offer favored you too much. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I believe a more equitable split is appropriate. I'm proposing I get $52 and you get $48, which is still favorable to you compared to a 50/50 split considering I've already taken a hit from inflation. Let's settle this now to avoid further depreciation for both of us.""}"
