166667.0,833333.0,"Alice, consider that if you wait until round 3, your bargaining power decreases sharply due to inflation — you’d be left with about $208333 nominal, which is only worth roughly $166667 in today's terms. Accepting this offer now avoids a much steeper loss. Let's settle and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,

300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, both of us have felt the sting of inflation. I propose a 30-70 split, ensuring you get a larger share. This way, we both salvage a fair deal before the value drops further.",Alice,3,

166667.0,833333.0,"Alice, every round we wait deepens our losses. If you reject this offer, by round 5 you'll be in the proposer’s seat but with your share discounted to roughly the same effective value—about $85333 after inflation. Accepting now lets you lock in 166667 nominal dollars (worth 85333 in current value), and avoids further erosion. Let's settle before the devaluation worsens further.",Bob,4,
