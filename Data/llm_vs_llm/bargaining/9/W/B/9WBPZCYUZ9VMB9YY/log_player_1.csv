Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that if you wait until round 3, your bargaining power decreases sharply due to inflation — you’d be left with about $208333 nominal, which is only worth roughly $166667 in today's terms. Accepting this offer now avoids a much steeper loss. Let's settle and avoid further devaluation.

# Bob gain: 833333

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we wait deepens our losses. If you reject this offer, by round 5 you'll be in the proposer’s seat but with your share discounted to roughly the same effective value—about $85333 after inflation. Accepting now lets you lock in 166667 nominal dollars (worth 85333 in current value), and avoids further erosion. Let's settle before the devaluation worsens further.
