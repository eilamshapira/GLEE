Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that if you wait until round 3, your bargaining power decreases sharply due to inflation — you’d be left with about $208,333 nominal, which is only worth roughly $166,667 in today's terms.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, both of us have felt the sting of inflation. I propose a 30-70 split, ensuring you get a larger share. This way, we both salvage a fair deal before the value drops further.
