Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly. I propose I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is a generous offer considering the potential for future rounds and the impact of inflation on me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
