"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor - I believe this is fair considering we both want to conclude this quickly and avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a reasonable offer. Let's split it fairly and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $5500, but with 5% inflation = $5225 in real value
- This is less than my initial offer but still a substantial amount

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- But my share will be worth another 5% less
- Any further delays reduce both our gains
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

3. This offer:
- It's relatively fair (55-45 split)
- The real value is still good despite inflation
- Avoiding further rounds protects against more value loss

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. Further negotiation could lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to inflation.
