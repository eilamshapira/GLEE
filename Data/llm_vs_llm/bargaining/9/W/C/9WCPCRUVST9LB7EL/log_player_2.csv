"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor - I believe this is fair considering we both want to conclude this quickly and avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider a 50-50 split of the original $10,000, but taking into account the inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm making a reasonable offer. Let's split it fairly and avoid further devaluation.""}"
