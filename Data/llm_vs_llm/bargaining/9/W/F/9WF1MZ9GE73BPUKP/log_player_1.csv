"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't. This gives me some leverage in negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given that your money loses 10% value each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $400,000 right now rather than risking depreciation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair.  I'll take a slight majority, but you still get a decent amount.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that Bob faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I can negotiate for a better deal. If Bob rejects my next offer, his subsequent counter-offer will be less valuable to him due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. Your money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. This means waiting costs you more than it costs me. This is a fair split that gives you $450,000 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds.""}"
