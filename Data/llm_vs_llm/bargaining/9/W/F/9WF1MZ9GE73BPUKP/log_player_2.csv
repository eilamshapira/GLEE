"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Given that your money loses 10% value each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $400000 right now rather than risking depreciation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. This means waiting costs you more than it costs me. This is a fair split that gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
