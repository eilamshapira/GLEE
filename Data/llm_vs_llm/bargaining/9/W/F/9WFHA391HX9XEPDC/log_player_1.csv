"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial amount while keeping a slightly larger share for myself since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round if this gets declined. This is a reasonable first offer that should be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $500,000 at 95% value = $475,000 effective value
2. If I reject, the next round will have another 5% inflation for me
3. We've already used 2 rounds out of 12, so time is becoming a factor
4. 50-50 split is generally considered fair
5. Bob's counter-offer is reasonable, and the inflation penalty will only get worse

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. Getting $475,000 in effective value now is better than risking further inflation penalties.
