"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000 total.

This is the first round, and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. However, I don't know if Alice faces inflation, which could potentially give me leverage in negotiations.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer (45% for me), but I might be able to negotiate for a more equitable split, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money, which gives us each $5,000. This is the most equitable division and represents a fair compromise from Alice's initial offer."
