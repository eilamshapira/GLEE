"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. It's the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. The offer is a 40-60 split, which gives me $40
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. $40 now is better than a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. While not perfectly equal, 40-60 is a reasonable split

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. Getting $40 now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
