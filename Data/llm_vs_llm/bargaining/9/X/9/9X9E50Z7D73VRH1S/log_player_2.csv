"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share and avoids the inflation penalty. With each round, the money becomes worth less to me due to 20% inflation, so it's in both our interests to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which would give us each $5,000. She mentions that inflation also affects her (at 20% per round according to her claim), so settling now would be beneficial for both of us.

This is a fair initial offer. While I could reject and counter with a proposal that gives me more, I need to consider that:
1. The money is worth 10% less to me each round
2. If we go to another round, even if I get more in absolute terms, the value might be lower due to inflation
3. A 50-50 split is equitable and reasonable

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer.
