"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a relatively fair split but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation on Bob's side, his $60 is actually worth $54 to him
2. My $40 maintains its full value
3. This is worse than my initial offer of $55 for me and $45 for Bob
4. I still have many rounds left to negotiate
5. Given that Bob will face increasing inflation, his bargaining position weakens with each round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob is facing increasing inflation (now 10%), and I'm not affected by inflation, I'll maintain a strong position but still make a reasonable offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. Given that Bob's money is now worth 10% less to him, this $40 is actually worth $36 to him. If we keep going, his position will only get worse due to inflation, so this is still a reasonable offer for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 27.1% inflation on Bob's side, his $58 is actually worth about $42.28 to him
2. My $42 maintains its full value
3. This is significantly worse than my previous offer of $60 for me
4. Bob's bargaining power is weakening considerably due to increasing inflation
5. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate
6. Given the accelerating inflation rate (from 10% to 27.1%), Bob's position will continue to deteriorate rapidly

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob is now facing 27.1% inflation and it's increasing significantly each round, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor, but still leaving enough for Bob to seriously consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. Given Bob's current inflation rate of 27.1%, his $35 would be worth approximately $25.52 to him. If he rejects this, the inflation will continue to increase, making future amounts worth even less to him. This offer gives him a chance to cut his losses before inflation gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 40.95% inflation on Bob's side, his $56 is only worth about $33.07 to him
2. My $44 maintains its full value
3. This is much worse than my previous offer of $65 for me
4. Bob's inflation has increased dramatically (from 27.1% to 40.95%)
5. I still have 6 rounds left
6. The inflation rate is accelerating quickly, which means Bob's position will be even weaker in the next rounds
7. It seems Bob might not fully understand how badly inflation is affecting his position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob now facing 40.95% inflation and the rate increasing rapidly, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor. Bob needs to understand that delaying agreement is significantly hurting his position.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose I get $75 and Bob gets $25. Given Bob's current inflation rate of 40.95%, his $25 would be worth approximately $14.76 to him. The inflation rate is increasing dramatically each round, so this might be one of the last chances for Bob to get any meaningful value. If he rejects this, his future gains will be worth even less due to the accelerating inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 52.17% inflation on Bob's side, his $54 is only worth about $25.83 to him
2. My $46 maintains its full value
3. This is much worse than my previous offer of $75 for me
4. Bob's inflation has increased dramatically again (from 40.95% to 52.17%)
5. I still have 4 rounds left
6. The inflation rate is accelerating rapidly - Bob is losing about half of his value now
7. Bob seems to be making irrational offers given his severe inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob now facing a devastating 52.17% inflation rate and the rate increasing sharply each round, I'll make a strong offer that reflects this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I propose I get $85 and Bob gets $15. Given Bob's current inflation rate of 52.17%, his $15 would be worth only about $7.17 to him. At this point, Bob needs to seriously consider accepting because:
1. The inflation rate is increasing dramatically each round
2. We only have 3 rounds left before we both get nothing
3. His future gains will be worth even less due to the accelerating inflation
4. This might be one of his last chances to get any meaningful value from this negotiation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 61.26% inflation on Bob's side, his $52 is only worth about $20.14 to him
2. My $48 maintains its full value
3. This is drastically worse than my previous offer of $85 for me
4. Bob's inflation has increased yet again (from 52.17% to 61.26%)
5. Only 2 rounds remain before we both get nothing
6. Bob is now losing over 60% of his value to inflation
7. Bob continues to make seemingly irrational offers given that his money is worth less than half its nominal value

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","With only this round and one more remaining, and Bob facing a severe 61.26% inflation rate, I'll make a very strong offer that reflects both the time pressure and economic reality.

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I propose I get $95 and Bob gets $5. Here's why this is rational:
1. Bob's current inflation rate of 61.26% means his $5 would be worth about $1.94 to him
2. Only one round remains after this
3. If we don't agree in the next round, we both get nothing
4. The inflation rate will be even worse in the final round
5. Bob needs to understand that getting something is better than nothing, and we're running out of time
6. His continued rejection of previous offers has put him in this disadvantageous position"
