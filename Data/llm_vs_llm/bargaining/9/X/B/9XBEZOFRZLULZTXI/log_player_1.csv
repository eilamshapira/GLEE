"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a fair starting offer that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for the different inflation rates we face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair considering we both face inflation, though yours is higher at 20% compared to my 10%. An equal division now would benefit both of us rather than continuing to lose value through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
