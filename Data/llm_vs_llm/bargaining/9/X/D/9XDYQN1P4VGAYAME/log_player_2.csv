"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine maintains its value, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. If I reject:

- In the next round, Alice's 70$ would only be worth 63$ to her
- I could propose a more favorable split, knowing her money is worth less
- She would be incentivized to accept a lower amount rather than risk further devaluation

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, and she's already been through one devaluation, I should propose a split that takes this into account but isn't too aggressive to ensure she accepts.

From Alice's perspective, if she rejects my offer, her money will devalue another 10% in the next round. This gives me leverage to propose a more favorable split for myself, but I need to make it attractive enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $40 now is worth more than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation
2. It's a significant improvement for me compared to the initial offer
3. It's not so extreme that it would certainly trigger a rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me $40 (up from her initial $30)
2. Her $60 is actually worth only about $48.6 to her due to 19% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - In the next round, her money will depreciate further (by 29%)
   - I can make another counter-offer
   - But she might also make an even worse offer in round 5

This offer is better than her first one, but given my strong position (my money doesn't devalue) and her weakening position (19% devaluation), I think I can get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice's money has already devalued by 19%
2. If she rejects this offer, her money will devalue by 29% in the next round
3. She's shown willingness to negotiate by increasing my share from 30 to 40 in her last offer

I should propose a split that's significantly better for me while still being acceptable to Alice given her deteriorating position.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $30 now (worth about $24.3 to her with current 19% inflation) is better than risking further devaluation
2. If she rejects, her next round will have 29% devaluation, making any amount significantly less valuable
3. The trend of negotiations suggests we're moving toward a more favorable split for me
4. This is a reasonable escalation from my previous offer of 60/40"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $50 (up from her previous $40)
2. Her $50 is only worth about $32.80 to her due to 34.39% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round, her money will depreciate even more (by about 44%)
   - I can make another counter-offer
   - But this has been a long negotiation, and she might become more aggressive

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, this offer is actually quite reasonable:
- I've gotten a significant improvement from her initial $30 offer
- It's a fair nominal split (50/50)
- The real value split is actually in my favor due to inflation
- There's risk in continuing to push too hard
