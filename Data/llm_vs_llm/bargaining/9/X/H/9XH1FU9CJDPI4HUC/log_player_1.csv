"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a fair share, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split that gives you a significant portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
