"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So next round, we'd effectively be dividing $90 (from my perspective).

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
