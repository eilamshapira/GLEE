"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on backward‐induction reasoning—and assuming that if the negotiation reaches later rounds each player “discounts” the base 1,000,000 dollars (with your money losing 10% per extra round and Bob’s 20% per extra round)—an equilibrium solution can be derived as follows:

Let the “base‐dollar” amounts be those in the proposal at a given round, with the actual “real‐value” for you being multiplied by 0.9^(round–1) and for Bob by 0.8^(round–1). (For example, an offer in Round 1 “as is” has no discount, but in Round 2 your amount would be worth only 90% of its nominal value, while Bob’s amount would be worth 80% of its nominal value.)

A quick sketch of the backward‐induction steps (working backward from Round 12) is:

1. In Round 12 the proposer is Bob. Since if Alice rejects she gets nothing, Bob would claim almost all the money (giving Alice a negligibly small amount). For simplicity, we set his equilibrium proposal to be: Alice = 0, Bob = 1,000,000.

2. In Round 11 the proposer is you. To get Bob to accept immediately rather than waiting for Round 12, you must offer him an amount that, once discounted by his factor for Round 11, equals what he would get if he waited and then received nearly 1,000,000 in Round 12 (discounted by his factor there). That calculation shows you must leave Bob 800,000 base dollars (so that 800,000×0.8^(10) = 1,000,000×0.8^(11)). You thereby keep 200,000.

3. Working back through each round and using similar acceptance conditions (so that the responder is indifferent to waiting), one finds that at:
  • Round 10 (Bob’s proposal): Alice must get 180,000 base dollars.
  • Round 9 (your proposal): Bob gets 656,000 base dollars.
  • …
  • Continuing in this fashion all the way back to Round 1.
  
After completing these calculations (the details involve matching the discounted amounts in each round), the equilibrium outcome in Round 1 (when you are the proposer) turns out to be:

  • You (Alice) claim 614,775.66 base dollars.
  • Bob gets 385,224.34 base dollars.

In Round 1 there is no discount applied yet (since it’s the first round), so these base amounts are the actual amounts offered. Moreover, Bob’s acceptance condition is exactly met: accepting 385,224.34 now is worth the same (for him) as his continuation value if he rejects and makes a proposal in Round 2 (after his 20% depreciation).

Thus, my Round 1 offer is as follows:

{""alice_gain"": 614775.66, ""bob_gain"": 385224.34}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
