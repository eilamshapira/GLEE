Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose to split the $10,000 as $7,000 for me and $3,000 for you. This way, we both get a good portion without waiting and risking loss due to devaluation. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. We both deserve an equal share, and delaying further means the money loses value for both of us. Let's finalize this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
