"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that I (Alice) am affected by 10% inflation per round while Bob isn't. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which is fair for both parties. This way, we can both walk away with a significant amount without needing to go through multiple rounds where my share would lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I get $4500, it's actually worth $4050 to me
2. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
3. Bob's offer is somewhat reasonable considering the inflation pressure I'm under
4. Continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for me due to the increasing inflation
