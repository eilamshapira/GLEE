"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I should take into account the asymmetric inflation factor - my money doesn't lose value over rounds, but Alice's does by 10% each round.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in round 2. Given that Alice faces inflation but I don't, I could reasonably ask for more than 50%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation, I should propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept. Given that Alice's money will be worth 10% less in the next round, it's in her interest to settle sooner rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a reasonable adjustment considering the asymmetric inflation factor, while still offering Alice a substantial portion that's worth more to her now than waiting for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 505000 
# Alice gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's counteroffer. She's proposing I get $505,000 and she gets $495,000, which is slightly better for me than her original 50-50 split.

Given that:
1. Alice is facing 19% inflation at this point, so her $495,000 is effectively worth less to her than it would have been in round 1
2. I face no inflation, so my $505,000 retains full value
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where Alice will face even more inflation (27.1%)
4. I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round

However, Alice has moved somewhat in my direction from her original offer. She might be reluctant to concede much more, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal that acknowledges the increasing inflation pressure on Alice while still improving my position slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 570000, 
""alice_gain"": 430000}

Since Alice now faces about 27% inflation if she rejects this offer and we move to round 5, it's increasingly in her interest to settle soon. My offer gives her $430,000 now, which is worth more to her than a potentially larger sum several rounds later. This split recognizes the asymmetric inflation situation while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than continue negotiations as her bargaining position weakens with each round."
