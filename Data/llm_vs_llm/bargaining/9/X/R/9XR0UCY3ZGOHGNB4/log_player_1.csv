"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for the inflation that will affect me more than Bob if we go to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me, considering the 10% inflation:

*   Bob's offer to me: $4500
*   Inflation adjustment: $4500 * 0.10 = $450
*   Effective value to me: $4500 - $450 = $4050

Now, let's consider what I would get if I reject and make an offer in round 3. The money would be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob. I'd have to offer Bob significantly more to account for his inflation, and I'd be starting from an even lower base value for myself.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.
