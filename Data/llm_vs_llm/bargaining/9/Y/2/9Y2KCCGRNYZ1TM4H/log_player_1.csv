"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money equally, which would be fair for both of us. If we drag this out, we both lose due to inflation, especially me since my inflation rate is higher.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round of delay costs you more with your steeper 10% rate. By accepting this offer now, you secure $4000 before further devaluation, while I take a slightly larger share for the comparatively smaller loss in value on my side. Let's avoid unnecessary loss and settle here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation affects both of us, but me more severely. I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor to compensate for my higher inflation rate. This is still very fair considering that if we delay further, we'll both lose more value. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the inflation is punishing you even more as rounds pass – every extra round means a 10% hit on your side. If we wait, you'll face even harsher devaluation in round 5. By accepting this offer now, you lock in a nominal $4900 (roughly $3570 in effective value), which is a much safer outcome than risking further losses. I believe this near‐even split fairly reflects our positions given the steep cost of delay. Let's settle now before we both lose more. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
