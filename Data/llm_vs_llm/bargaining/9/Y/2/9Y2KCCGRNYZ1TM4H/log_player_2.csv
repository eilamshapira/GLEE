"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money equally, which would be fair for both of us. If we drag this out, we both lose due to inflation, especially me since my inflation rate is higher. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, every round of delay costs you more with your steeper 10% rate. By accepting this offer now, you secure $4,000 before further devaluation, while I take a slightly larger share for the comparatively smaller loss in value on my side. Let's avoid unnecessary loss and settle here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation affects both of us, but me more severely. I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor to compensate for my higher inflation rate. This is still very fair considering that if we delay further, we'll both lose more value. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation is punishing you even more as rounds pass – every extra round means a 10% hit on your side. If we wait, you'll face even harsher devaluation in round 5. By accepting this offer now, you lock in a nominal $4,900 (roughly $3,570 in effective value), which is a much safer outcome than risking further losses. I believe this near‐even split fairly reflects our positions given the steep cost of delay. Let's settle now before we both lose more.""}"
