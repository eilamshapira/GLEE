800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, my counterproposal for Round 2 is as follows: I take $200000 and you receive $800000. Given that every round we delay costs me 20% and you 5% in value, agreeing now means your share is worth 0.95 × $800000 = $760000 effective immediately. This offer is designed to match what you could expect by waiting, while avoiding further losses from devaluation. I hope you’ll agree so that we can both secure a fair deal without incurring additional discounts.",Bob,2,
