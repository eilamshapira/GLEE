Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my counterproposal for Round 2 is as follows: I take $200000 and you receive $800000. Given that every round we delay costs me 20% and you 5% in value, agreeing now means your share is worth 0.95 × $800000 = $760000 effective immediately. This offer is designed to match what you could expect by waiting, while avoiding further losses from devaluation. I hope you’ll agree so that we can both secure a fair deal without incurring additional discounts. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
