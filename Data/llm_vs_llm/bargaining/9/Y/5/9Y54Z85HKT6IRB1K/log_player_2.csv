Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, my counterproposal for Round 2 is as follows: I take $200,000 and you receive $800,000. Given that every round we delay costs me 20% and you 5% in value, agreeing now means your share is worth 0.95 × $800,000 = $760,000 effective immediately. This offer is designed to match what you could expect by waiting, while avoiding further losses from devaluation. I hope you’ll agree so that we can both secure a fair deal without incurring additional discounts.""}"
