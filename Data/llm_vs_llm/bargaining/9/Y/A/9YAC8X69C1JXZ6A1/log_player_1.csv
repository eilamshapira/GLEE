"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is essentially giving him less value due to the 5% decrease, I'll consider this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's value, I'll try to make a more appealing offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a split that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the decreasing value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, Alice. We are both losing money if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time, and the inflation effect is starting to significantly reduce the value of his share. I'll consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
