"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation. I want to make a fair offer that Bob will likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider inflation and try to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I propose a slightly adjusted split that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm facing while still giving Bob a larger portion. This seems fair given our situation and should be reasonable for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic considering the continued inflation effect on my gains. I'll make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I propose this division where Bob gets a larger share, acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm under. This is a reasonable compromise that gives Bob a significant advantage while still providing me with a worthwhile amount."
