5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable for both of us, and accepting now means we both get maximum value before inflation reduces it further. A fair split now benefits us both more than extending negotiations.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, I see you want a more even split. How about this? Still better than nothing, and we're both losing value each round!",Alice,3,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, I appreciate your improved offer. Based on what you shared about your higher inflation rate (36% vs my 9.75%), I'm proposing this split that's fair when considering our different inflation impacts. This gives you $4700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting more rounds with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this deal now to maximize our combined value.",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alright Bob, one last try at a slightly better split in my favor. If we wait any longer, we both lose out significantly. This is as good as it gets!",Alice,5,
