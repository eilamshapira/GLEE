Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable for both of us, and accepting now means we both get maximum value before inflation reduces it further. A fair split now benefits us both more than extending negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your improved offer. Based on what you shared about your higher inflation rate (36% vs my 9.75%), I'm proposing this split that's fair when considering our different inflation impacts. This gives you $4700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting more rounds with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this deal now to maximize our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300
