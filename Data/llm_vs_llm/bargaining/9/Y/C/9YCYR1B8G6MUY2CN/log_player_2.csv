"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'll take a little more to make sure we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $4000 while she gets $6000. This is a 40/60 split in her favor.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but I'll be affected by 5% inflation, meaning my money will be worth less. After one round of inflation, $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me.

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, getting $4000 now is better than risking further rounds with decreasing value. However, since I'll be making the next proposal if I reject, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split of $5000 each. This is equitable for both of us, and accepting now means we both get maximum value before inflation reduces it further. A fair split now benefits us both more than extending negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you want a more even split. How about this? Still better than nothing, and we're both losing value each round! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4500 (a $500 increase from her first offer), while she takes $5500. This is a 45/55 split, which is more balanced than her initial offer.

I notice that Alice mentioned she's losing value more rapidly than me - she's experiencing 36% inflation compared to my 9.75% after two rounds. This gives me some leverage in negotiations.

Given that:
1) The offer is more reasonable than before
2) Alice is experiencing higher inflation than I am
3) We're only in round 3 of 12, so I still have room to negotiate
4) If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round

I think I can still get a better deal, especially considering Alice's higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, 
""alice_gain"": 4700, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your improved offer. Based on what you shared about your higher inflation rate (36% vs my 9.75%), I'm proposing this split that's fair when considering our different inflation impacts. This gives you $4700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting more rounds with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this deal now to maximize our combined value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, one last try at a slightly better split in my favor. If we wait any longer, we both lose out significantly. This is as good as it gets! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully assess this situation.

Alice has improved her offer again, now proposing I get $4800 (48%) and she gets $5200 (52%). This is getting closer to an even split and is much better than her initial 40/60 offer.

Important factors to consider:
1) Alice's inflation rate is extremely high at 59.04% after just 4 rounds, while mine is 18.55%
2) Alice is clearly emphasizing that further delays will hurt us both
3) We're approaching the middle of our 12-round limit
4) Her message suggests this is her final offer improvement

Given Alice's much higher inflation rate, waiting further rounds actually gives me negotiating leverage. However, pushing too hard might lead to both of us getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

$4800 is a reasonable amount considering where we started, and Alice's high inflation rate means she's highly motivated to conclude soon.
