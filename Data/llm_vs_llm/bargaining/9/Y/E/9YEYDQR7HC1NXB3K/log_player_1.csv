Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher split for myself as the first mover, but it's still quite fair with you getting $450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a completely fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and it's better for you than potentially losing more in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently with both of us getting an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
