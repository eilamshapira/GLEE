"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher split for myself as the first mover, but it's still quite fair with you getting $450000. This avoids us having to go through multiple rounds where we might both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000 (45%) while taking $550,000 (55%)
2. Her reasoning about avoiding multiple rounds has some merit
3. However, as the second mover, I can potentially negotiate a better deal
4. The split isn't terribly unfair, but I can likely achieve at least a 50-50 split

Given these considerations, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split, which is the most fair solution:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a completely fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and it's better for you than potentially losing more in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently with both of us getting an equal share.""}"
