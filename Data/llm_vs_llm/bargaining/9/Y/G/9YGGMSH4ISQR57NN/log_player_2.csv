"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
4. If I make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the actual value I'll receive will be reduced
5. $50 now is better than $55-60 in the next round (which would be worth less due to inflation)

Given these factors, this is a fair offer and the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject.
