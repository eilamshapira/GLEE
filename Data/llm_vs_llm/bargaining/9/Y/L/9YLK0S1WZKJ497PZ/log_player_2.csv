"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and mine doesn't lose value:

1. If I reject now, next round I can propose a split
2. Next round, $500,000 will only be worth $400,000 to Alice
3. This gives me negotiating leverage to ask for more

I should reject this and propose a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's value of money decreases by 20% each round, I can propose a split that takes advantage of this while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round where her money would be worth even less.

In round 3, any amount would be worth another 20% less to her, so she should be motivated to accept a reasonable offer now.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is fair because:
1. For me, this is $600,000 at full value
2. For Alice, $400,000 is actually worth $400,000 now
3. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For me, $400,000 is worth exactly $400,000
2. For Alice, $600,000 is actually only worth $384,000 (64% of original value) due to the 36% inflation
3. If I reject, next round:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less again (about 49% total reduction)
   - This gives me even more leverage

Since I don't face any inflation penalty and Alice's position will weaken further next round, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me calculate the optimal offer:

1. At this point, any money Alice receives is worth only 51.2% of its original value (after 49% reduction)
2. If she rejects this offer, in the next round her money will be worth only about 41% of original value
3. I can leverage this to propose a more favorable split for me, while still making it rational for her to accept

I'll propose a 70-30 split:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This is strategic because:
1. For me: I get $700,000 at full value
2. For Alice: $300,000 at 51.2% value is worth about $153,600 to her
3. If she rejects, any amount in the next round will be worth even less to her
4. This makes accepting now more attractive than continuing negotiation"
