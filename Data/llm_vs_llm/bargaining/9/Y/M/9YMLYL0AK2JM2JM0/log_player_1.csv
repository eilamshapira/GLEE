"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of the $1,000,000 with Bob, and I only have 12 rounds to do so. Since I'm in round 1, I'll start with a relatively fair offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer. To avoid unnecessary delays and potential losses in later rounds, I will accept.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
