"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $450,000, which is a 45-55 split. While this isn't exactly equal, it's a fairly reasonable first offer. 

However, since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds to go, I believe I can propose a more equitable split. By rejecting this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split, which is fair for both parties. This demonstrates my willingness to be equitable while still improving my position from Alice's previous offer.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000."
