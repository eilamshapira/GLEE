"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000, Alice gets $600,000
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Values will decrease: 
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * This gives me negotiating leverage as Alice's value decreases faster

The 60-40 split favors Alice significantly. Given that Alice has a much higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 5%), I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that Alice's money depreciates by 20% per round while mine only by 5%, I can propose a more favorable split for me. If she rejects, her share will be worth significantly less in the next round.

For her, $600,000 from round 1 is now worth only $480,000 (after 20% depreciation).
For me, $400,000 from round 1 would now be worth $380,000 (after 5% depreciation).

I'll propose a 70-30 split in my favor to capitalize on this depreciation difference.

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Given the higher depreciation rate on your side (20% vs 5%), this split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting another round. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering depreciation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: 
   * I get $450,000 × (1 - 0.0975) = $406,125 in round 1 value
   * Alice gets $550,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $352,000 in round 1 value

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * My depreciation will increase to 14.75%
   * Alice's depreciation will increase to 56%
   * The difference in our depreciation rates is becoming more significant

The current offer actually gives me more effective value than Alice due to the depreciation differences. Additionally, while I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round, the absolute value of my share would continue to decrease.

This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for the depreciation rates, and I'm getting a better effective value than the initial 60-40 split.
