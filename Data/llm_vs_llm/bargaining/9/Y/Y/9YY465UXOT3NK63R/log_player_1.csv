Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), we should conclude this now. This split is still good for you - if you reject, your share will be worth even less next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
