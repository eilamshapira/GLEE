"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split to start. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $40 now would be worth more than waiting
   - Next round, any amount will be worth 10% less to me
   - For Alice, it will be worth 20% less

Given that:
- The offer isn't completely unfair (40/60 split)
- Inflation will hurt both of us if we delay
- Alice would lose more from inflation than me in the next round, which gives me some negotiating power
- But there's no guarantee she'll accept my counter-offer

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. I should use this to my advantage but still make an offer that Alice would likely accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), we should conclude this now. This split is still good for you - if you reject, your share will be worth even less next round.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It gives me a better share than Alice's initial offer
2. The message reminds Alice that inflation hits her harder
3. It's not too greedy - still close enough to 50/50 to be acceptable
4. It emphasizes the urgency to conclude due to inflation"
