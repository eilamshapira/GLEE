"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer in Round 1.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split:
- Bob (me): $500,000
- Alice: $500,000

This is a perfectly fair division. While I could reject and make a counter-offer trying to get more in the next round, each round reduces the total value by 5%. If I reject, the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 in Round 2, meaning even if I got a better percentage, the absolute amount might be less.

A fair split in Round 1 avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation where we both lose value.
