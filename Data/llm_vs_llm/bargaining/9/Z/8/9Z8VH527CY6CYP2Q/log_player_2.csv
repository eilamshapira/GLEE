"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
5. I could try to negotiate a better deal

Given that I don't lose anything by continuing to negotiate and I could potentially get a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer. Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I'll propose a more equitable division while still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This is a 48-52 split, which is more balanced than the previous offer while still giving Alice a small advantage. This should be more appealing than my taking a more aggressive position, and it's fair enough that it would be difficult to justify rejecting it."
