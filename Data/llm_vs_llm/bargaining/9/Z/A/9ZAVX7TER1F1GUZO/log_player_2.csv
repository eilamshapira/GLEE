"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on Alice's offer, I would get $40 out of $100, while Alice would get $60. Given that we have 12 rounds available and each round reduces the value by 5% for me due to inflation, I should consider whether rejecting and making a counter-offer would be beneficial.

If I reject now, the total value in the next round would be worth 95% of the current value to me. So my $40 now would be worth more than $42.10 in the next round (since $42.10 Ã— 0.95 = $40).

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, getting $40 immediately is better than risking further negotiation with diminishing returns due to inflation.
