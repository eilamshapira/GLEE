"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at face value. However, I need to consider the inflation factor - if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me.

If I reject and propose something better for me in round 2, Alice might reject as well, leading to further rounds and more inflation, which hurts my position.

A 50-50 split in the first round gives me $50 with full value. If I tried for more in the next round, I'd need to get more than $52.63 just to break even (because $52.63 Ã— 0.95 = $50).

Given the risk of continued rejection and the fair nature of the initial offer, I'll accept.
