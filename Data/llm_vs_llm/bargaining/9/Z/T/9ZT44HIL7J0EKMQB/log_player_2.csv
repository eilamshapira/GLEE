"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the amount evenly, $5000 each. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which is $5000 each. This is a perfectly fair and equitable division that aligns with principles of fairness and mutual benefit. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal, and we might end up in a back-and-forth that could lead to worse outcomes. A fair split right from the start shows good faith and avoids unnecessary conflict.
