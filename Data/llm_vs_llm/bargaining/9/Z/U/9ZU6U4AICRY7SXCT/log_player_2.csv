"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:
- Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
- If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round for me
- In the next round, $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 to me
- There's risk in rejecting as we only have 12 rounds total
- However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer

The offer isn't terrible, but I think I can do better by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since Alice made the first move with a split favoring her.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split as it's more equitable while still giving me a slight advantage. If Alice rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation, so this offer is reasonable enough that it should be attractive to Alice while improving my position from her initial offer."
