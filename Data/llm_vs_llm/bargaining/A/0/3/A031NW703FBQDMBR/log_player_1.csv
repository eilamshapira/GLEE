"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```

This is a slightly advantageous offer for me, hoping Bob will accept it to secure a good portion of the money in the first round. I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing my potential gain and increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While I'd prefer a bit more, 5000 is a fair split, and we're already in Round 2. It's better to secure this amount than risk losing everything in later rounds.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
