"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, we both benefit from agreeing early. This gives us both equal amounts and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair offer, and given the inflation rate of 20% per round, it's beneficial to secure this amount rather than risking a lower value in the next rounds."
