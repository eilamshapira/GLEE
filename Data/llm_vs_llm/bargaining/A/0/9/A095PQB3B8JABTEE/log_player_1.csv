"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split considering future deflation - you get 40$ now which is better than a smaller amount later due to your 20% inflation rate.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is fair, considering that we both face deflation if we delay further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. With 10% inflation for me, the $50 now is better than $60 in a later round
2. Further negotiations would lead to more value loss for both parties
3. A 50/50 split is reasonably fair
4. The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 makes accepting a fair offer now the better choice"
