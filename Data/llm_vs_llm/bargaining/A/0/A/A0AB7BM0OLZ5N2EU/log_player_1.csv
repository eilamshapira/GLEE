"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation next round. Let's settle now? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The original $45 would be worth $45 * 0.8 = $36 to me, considering the inflation.

I think I can do better than that, so I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me again, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation, let's settle before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, that means the original $50 would be worth $50 * 0.512 = $25.60 to me, considering the inflation.

While splitting it evenly might seem fair, I have to consider the fact that I've already lost a significant amount of value due to inflation. However, the fact that Bob is offering an even split suggests that he might be feeling the effects of inflation as well.

I think I'll accept this offer, as it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing.
