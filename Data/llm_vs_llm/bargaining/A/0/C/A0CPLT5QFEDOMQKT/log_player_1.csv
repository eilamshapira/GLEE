"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, the total value will decrease significantly more for him than for me in the next round. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly, and this split gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 90% for me and 60% for Bob
   * I can make a new offer, and I have a stronger position due to Bob's higher inflation rate

Given that Bob's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), and that I can make a better offer next round where his position will be even weaker, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3:
- My money is worth 90% of original value
- Bob's money is worth 60% of original value

Bob's position is significantly weaker now due to the higher inflation rate affecting him. I can propose a more aggressive split in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split. For Bob, $300,000 at 60% value equals $180,000 effective value. If he rejects, in the next round his money will only be worth 40% of the original value, making any future gains much less valuable for him. This offer, while more aggressive than my first one, still gives Bob a reasonable amount considering the current circumstances and should incentivize him to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $420,000 at 85.74% value = $360,108 effective value
   * Bob gets $580,000 at 51.2% value = $296,960 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 81.45% for me and 40.96% for Bob
   * I can make a new offer, and Bob's position continues to weaken significantly

Given that:
1. Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine
2. The effective value Bob would get from this offer is already less than what I would get
3. My negotiating position will be even stronger next round
4. Bob's future offers will have to be increasingly larger to compensate for his severe inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 5:
- My money is worth 81.45% of original value
- Bob's money is worth 40.96% of original value

Bob's position has deteriorated significantly. At this point, even a smaller nominal amount for me is worth more in effective value than a larger nominal amount for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose an 80-20 split. Let's analyze the effective values:
- For me: $800,000 × 81.45% = $651,600 effective value
- For Bob: $200,000 × 40.96% = $81,920 effective value

If Bob rejects this offer:
- Next round his money will only be worth about 32.77% (another 20% drop)
- My money will be worth about 77.38% (another 5% drop)
- Making any future gains much less valuable for him

This offer, while aggressive, is logical given the severe inflation affecting Bob's gains. He should seriously consider accepting as his negotiating position will continue to weaken substantially with each round."
