"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose an even split in this round. I believe a 50/50 division is fair for both of us given the time sensitivity and the diminishing value on my end. Let's conclude the deal now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
