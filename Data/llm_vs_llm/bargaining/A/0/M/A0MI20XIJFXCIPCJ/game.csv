60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This way we both get a substantial amount and can conclude quickly before inflation reduces our gains.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still fair considering I'm taking the risk of inflation by moving to the next round. Let's end this quickly.,Bob,2,
