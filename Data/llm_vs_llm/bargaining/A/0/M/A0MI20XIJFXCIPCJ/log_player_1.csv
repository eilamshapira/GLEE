"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This way we both get a substantial amount and can conclude quickly before inflation reduces our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still fair considering I'm taking the risk of inflation by moving to the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's effectively worth $40.50 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less to me
3. If I were to get even $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $48 to me due to 20% inflation
4. There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer
5. The current offer ($40.50 effective value) is likely better than what I could achieve in future rounds due to compounding inflation
