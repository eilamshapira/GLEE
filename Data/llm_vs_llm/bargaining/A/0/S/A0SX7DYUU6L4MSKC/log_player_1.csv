"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that acknowledges both our interests while considering the inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still offers Bob a substantial sum. If Bob rejects this, we'll both face the 5% inflation penalty in the next round, which would reduce the real value of my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000 with 5% inflation, so effectively $475,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But my gains will be worth another 5% less (10% total)
   - And there's risk Bob might reject again

Given that Bob is proposing an equal split but the inflation is actually hurting him more (10% vs my 5%), this is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject, I might end up with less due to compounding inflation.
