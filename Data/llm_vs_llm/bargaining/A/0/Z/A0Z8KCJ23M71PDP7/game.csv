800000.0,200000.0,Let's split this fairly! I'm offering you a generous 20%.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be reasonable, 60/40 seems like a better split to me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Look, I'm being more generous this time. I believe this is a good split that accounts for the diminishing value of the money for both of us. Take it!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it 50/50 before the value decreases further. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alright Bob, last chance to get a decent share! Inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. This is my final, slightly more generous offer. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Let's be realistic about the value left. A 55/45 split is more than fair at this point, considering the inflation. It's better for both of us to get something than to risk losing everything.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the end. I'm giving you almost half now. This is my final offer. Don't let pride get in the way of a decent payout. Let's end this before we both end up with nothing.",Alice,7,
