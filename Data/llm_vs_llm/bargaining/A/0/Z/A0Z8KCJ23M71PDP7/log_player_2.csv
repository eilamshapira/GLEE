"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and this is the first round I'm making an offer, I'll take that into consideration. However, for the first round, the value hasn't decreased yet for my perspective as I'm making the offer now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, I'm being more generous this time. I believe this is a good split that accounts for the diminishing value of the money for both of us. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value, let's calculate the actual value for me:

Original offer for me: $350,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 36% (1 - 0.64 = 0.36)
Actual value for me: $350,000 * 0.64 = $224,000

And for Alice:
Original offer for Alice: $650,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 9.75% (1 - 0.0925 = 0.9075)
Actual value for Alice: $650,000 * 0.9075 = $589,875

Given the significant decrease in value for me and the fact that we still have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money is worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, and we are in round 4, I'll make an offer that takes into account the diminishing value.

For me, the value has decreased by 36% in round 3, and now it will decrease by another 20% in this round, making it a total of 56% less (1 - 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.56) than the original value.
For Alice, the value has decreased by 9.75% in round 3, and now it will decrease by another 5% in this round, making it a total of 14.5% less (1 - 0.9075 * 0.95 = 0.145) than the original value.

However, since I'm making the offer now, the decrease for me is still 36% from the start, and for Alice, it's 9.75% from the start.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 before the value decreases further. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, last chance to get a decent share! Inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. This is my final, slightly more generous offer. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value:

Original offer for me: $400,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 59.04% (1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904)
Actual value for me: $400,000 * 0.4096 = $163,840

And for Alice:
Original offer for Alice: $600,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 18.55% (1 - 0.8145 = 0.1855)
Actual value for Alice: $600,000 * 0.8145 = $488,700

Given that we are halfway through the rounds and the value is decreasing rapidly for me, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a significant amount, even if it's not ideal. However, Alice's offer still seems to favor her heavily.

Since this is not truly her ""final offer"" (as she can still make another offer if I reject this one), and considering the actual values, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money is worth 59.04% less for me and 18.55% less for Alice, and we are in round 6, I'll make an offer that takes into account the diminishing value.

For me, the value has decreased significantly, so I'll aim for a more equal split to compensate for the loss.

""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end. I'm giving you almost half now. This is my final offer. Don't let pride get in the way of a decent payout. Let's end this before we both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value:

Original offer for me: $480,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 73.79% (1 - 0.2621 = 0.7379)
Actual value for me: $480,000 * 0.2621 = $125,808

And for Alice:
Original offer for Alice: $520,000
Decrease in value due to inflation: 26.49% (1 - 0.7351 = 0.2649)
Actual value for Alice: $520,000 * 0.7351 = $382,252

Given that we are running out of rounds and the value is decreasing rapidly for both of us, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a significant amount, even if it's not ideal. Alice's offer, although not perfectly equal, is closer to a fair split than her previous offers, and the actual value I'd receive is still substantial compared to the risk of losing everything.

Considering the circumstances and the fact that this might indeed be a final opportunity for a decent payout, I'll accept this offer.
