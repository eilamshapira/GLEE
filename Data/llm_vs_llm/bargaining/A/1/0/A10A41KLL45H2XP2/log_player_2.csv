"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze the offer.

Alice is offering me $100,000 in the first round. If I accept, I get $100,000. If I reject, the value of that money to me will decrease by 20% each round.

Let's calculate the value of $100,000 in future rounds, discounted by 20% each round:

*   Round 1: $100,000
*   Round 2: $100,000 * 0.8 = $80,000
*   Round 3: $80,000 * 0.8 = $64,000
*   Round 4: $64,000 * 0.8 = $51,200
*   Round 5: $51,200 * 0.8 = $40,960
*   Round 6: $40,960 * 0.8 = $32,768
*   Round 7: $32,768 * 0.8 = $26,214.4
*   Round 8: $26,214.4 * 0.8 = $20,971.52
*   Round 9: $20,971.52 * 0.8 = $16,777.216
*   Round 10: $16,777.216 * 0.8 = $13,421.7728
*   Round 11: $13,421.7728 * 0.8 = $10,737.41824
*   Round 12: $10,737.41824 * 0.8 = $8,589.934592

Alice is getting a very large share ($900,000). However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, $100,000 in the first round might be the best I can get. I will reject to try and get more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn. Knowing the money loses value quickly for me (20% each round) while Alice's money degrades slower (5%), I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for her to accept, but also gives me a reasonable amount.

Let's aim for a roughly 60/40 split in my favor *before* considering the inflation. I will ask for 600,000$ and offer Alice 400,000$.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

Alice is offering me $150,000. Since it's round 3, my money is worth 36% less than in round 1, meaning it's worth 64% of its original value. So, the $150,000 is effectively worth $150,000 * 0.64 = $96,000 in round 1 terms.

Let's calculate the value of attempting to make an offer in the next round and what the money would be worth to me then:

*   Round 4: Value is 1 - (20% * 3) = 1- 0.6 = 0.4 the original value. If I proposed to keep $250,000, it would be worth 100,000.

If I go to round 4, it's highly unlikely I will get more than 250,000$.

Given the rapid inflation, $96,000 in round 1 terms is better than the likely outcome in later rounds. I'll accept the offer.
