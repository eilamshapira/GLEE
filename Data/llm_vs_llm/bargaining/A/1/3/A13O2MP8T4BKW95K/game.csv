5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500 out of the $10000. Given the structure and possible future rounds, I believe this is a fair starting point. I look forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. I believe a 52-48 split is more reasonable, considering the game's structure and the inflation effect. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,2,

9850.0,150.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $9850 while you get $150. Given that if you reject this offer and get to propose in round 4, the inflation will further erode the value of your money (by about 15% relative to round 1), your fallback would essentially be nearly nothing. I believe this offer is rationally better for you than risking even lower effective returns in the future. I look forward to your response.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation effect is working against me, but I believe a 40-60 split is more reasonable at this point. Let's try to find a middle ground before the value of my share decreases further.",Bob,4,
