Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500 out of the $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. I believe a 52-48 split is more reasonable, considering the game's structure and the inflation effect. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3

Given that if you reject this offer and get to propose in round 4, the inflation will further erode the value of your money (by about 15% relative to round 1), your fallback would essentially be nearly nothing. I believe this offer is rationally better for you than risking even lower effective returns in the future. I look forward to your response.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation effect is working against me, but I believe a 40-60 split is more reasonable at this point. Let's try to find a middle ground before the value of my share decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000
