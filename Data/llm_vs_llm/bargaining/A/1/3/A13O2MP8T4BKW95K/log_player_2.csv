"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500 out of the $10000. Given the structure and possible future rounds, I believe this is a fair starting point. I look forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation effect, I want to make a fair but slightly favorable offer to myself. 

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. I believe a 52-48 split is more reasonable, considering the game's structure and the inflation effect. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $9850 while you get $150. Given that if you reject this offer and get to propose in round 4, the inflation will further erode the value of your money (by about 15% relative to round 1), your fallback would essentially be nearly nothing. I believe this offer is rationally better for you than risking even lower effective returns in the future. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 150 
# Alice gain: 9850 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money has decreased for me, but not for Alice. Since Alice rejected my previous offer and made a very low offer in return, I'll try to make a more reasonable proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the inflation effect is working against me, but I believe a 40-60 split is more reasonable at this point. Let's try to find a middle ground before the value of my share decreases further.""}"
