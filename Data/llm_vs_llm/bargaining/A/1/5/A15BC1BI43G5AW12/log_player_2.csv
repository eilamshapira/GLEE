"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Alice, I need to consider whether it's fair and how it compares to what I might get in future rounds, accounting for the 20% inflation penalty per round.

Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject this and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, I would need to get more than $4000 of that $8000 value to come out ahead. Since inflation will continue to reduce the value in subsequent rounds, it's reasonable to accept this initial offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
