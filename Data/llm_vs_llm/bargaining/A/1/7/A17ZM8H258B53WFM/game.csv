1.0,99.0,"Alice, as rounds progress your money loses 20% of its value. Accepting now gives you $1 in nominal terms (worth $0.80 to you), which is better than risking a future where you'll end up with nothing. Please accept this offer.",Bob,2,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. In this round, your share is worth 51.2% of its nominal value, and if you wait for your turn, further inflation will erode it even more. I’m offering you $1 now—a better deal than facing the inevitable further devaluation. Please accept this offer to secure whatever modest value remains.",Bob,4,

2.0,98.0,"Alice, further delay will decimate the value of your share even more—trust me, $2 nominal now is far superior to what you can expect if you wait until round 7. Accepting this offer guarantees you a better effective outcome than risking another round of severe devaluation. Let's end this game on a rational note.",Bob,6,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, the situation is now critical—your $1 in this round is worth about 21 cents in first-round value, and if you wait until round 9, you'll lose even more. I’m offering you the minimal amount that’s better than the alternative of virtually nothing. Please accept this offer to salvage any value for you.",Bob,8,
