This is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While the penalty from inflation is increasing, I'm hoping to push Alice towards a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 

I'm lowering my ask slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a significantly better outcome than Alice's offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. While the inflation is becoming more significant, accepting an 80/20 split even this late in the game feels like a bad precedent. There's a chance Alice becomes more reasonable as we approach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000} 

Lowering my offer again, trying to signal a willingness to negotiate while the potential gains are still significant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The clock is ticking, but I'm holding out hope that Alice will move closer to a more reasonable split. A 75/25 split is still too far from fair, even considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Let's go for a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest deal and given the increasing inflation and the remaining rounds, it's getting risky to hold out for much more."
