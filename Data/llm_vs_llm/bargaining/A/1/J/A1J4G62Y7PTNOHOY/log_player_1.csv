"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a fair initial offer while considering that any delay will reduce the value for me by 20% per round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split it 55/45, slightly in my favor but still fair. This gives Bob a good incentive to accept rather than risk getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $40 now is actually worth $32 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split in round 3, Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation for me
4. Bob has no inflation penalty, so they can afford to be patient

While $40 (worth $32 to me) is less than ideal, rejecting would likely lead to an even worse outcome for me due to compounding inflation.
