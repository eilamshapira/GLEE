"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me
   * $100 Ã— 0.95 = $95 total value for me
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
   * If Alice rejects, we'd go to round 3 with another 5% loss

While I might be able to negotiate a better split, the risk of further devaluation and the possibility of Alice rejecting my counter-offer makes the current offer relatively reasonable. $40 now is better than potentially less later.
