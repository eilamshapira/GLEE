"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split! I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and we can avoid losing money to inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I see you want more. I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $5200, leaving you with $4800. This is a better offer than before and avoids more inflation eating away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 5200
