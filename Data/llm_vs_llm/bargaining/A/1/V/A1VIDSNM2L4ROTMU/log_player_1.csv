"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I’ve been thinking about the future rounds. With each round that passes, I lose a bit of value while your money remains fully intact. To avoid further delay (and my inevitable loss due to inflation), I’m offering you the entire $100 now. Let’s settle this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
