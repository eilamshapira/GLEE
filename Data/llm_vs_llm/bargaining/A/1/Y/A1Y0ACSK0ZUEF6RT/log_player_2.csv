Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. Time is running out and the value is decreasing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm assuming that while the *total* amount decreases, the proportions stay the same.  Alice's offer still heavily favors her, and it's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, slightly more for you but we both secure a decent amount.  The clock is ticking!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, a slight adjustment - 58/42. Let's settle this before inflation eats away more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is moving in the right direction, it's still not a great deal for me. The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I'm willing to hold out a bit longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both leave with something substantial.""}"
