"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation, with you losing 5% and me losing 10% each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. This offer benefits both of us more than the initial one, considering inflation impacts us differently. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept now:
- I get $475,000 worth 90% of original value = $427,500 effective value
- Bob gets $525,000 worth 95% of original value = $498,750 effective value

If I reject and propose in next round:
- Values will decrease further (80% for me, 90% for Bob)
- Even if I propose a higher split in my favor, the absolute value will be lower
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Since the effective value I'm getting ($427,500) is still substantial, and waiting would only decrease the real value further due to the higher inflation rate affecting me, I should accept this offer.
