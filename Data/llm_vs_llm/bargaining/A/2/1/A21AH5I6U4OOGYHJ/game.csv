45.0,55.0,"Given the inflation risk and the fact that we're now in round 2, I propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the potential decrease in value. This way, we both still get a significant share, but I believe it's fair considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Since we're now in round 4 and the inflation effect on your gains is significant, I'm proposing a split that gives me 60% to account for the unchanged value of my share over time. This offer still leaves you with a considerable amount, considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
