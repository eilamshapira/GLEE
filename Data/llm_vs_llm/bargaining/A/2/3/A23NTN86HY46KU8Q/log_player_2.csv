Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Alice's offer is getting closer to being fair, but it's still not ideal considering the money is losing value for her. I'll aim for a more balanced distribution in the next round."

Round 4

This offer is a slight improvement for me compared to a 50/50 split, acknowledging that the value of the money is decreasing for Alice. It's still a reasonable and fair offer."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I could try to negotiate for a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now makes the most sense. The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Alice, and waiting any longer might lead her to make a less favorable offer. It's better to secure a fair deal now than risk losing more value."
