"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider whether to accept Alice's offer of a 60-40 split in her favor, or to reject it and make my own proposal in the next round. If I reject, inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% for me.

If I accept, I get $40 right now.
If I reject and propose in the next round, the $100 will be worth only $80 to me due to inflation. Even if I were to get all $80, that would only be worth $80 to me, and realistically Alice would not accept such an extreme proposal.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that $40 now is better than potentially less later, I'll accept this reasonable offer.
