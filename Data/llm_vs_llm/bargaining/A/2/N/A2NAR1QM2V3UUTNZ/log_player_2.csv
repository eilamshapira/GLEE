"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $4,000
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Total value for me would be $8,000 maximum (if I propose taking everything), but really worth $6,400 due to inflation
   - Alice might reject my offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 40% isn't ideal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds due to inflation. The inflation penalty makes quick resolution more valuable.
