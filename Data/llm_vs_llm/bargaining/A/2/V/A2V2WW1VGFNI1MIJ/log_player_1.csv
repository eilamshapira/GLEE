"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and we can conclude the game immediately without any risk of inflation reducing our gains in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while an even split sounds fair in principle, I'm taking on the risk of inflation by letting this go to the second round.  Therefore I think a slightly larger share for me is justified.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm not affected by inflation at all in this game, so there's no reason for me to accept less than a fair split. In fact, inflation is reducing the value of your share with each round, not mine. I'm offering you $4800 which, even with 10% inflation, is worth more to you now ($4320 in round 1 value) than what you'd get if we continue to another round and face additional inflation. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value.""}"
