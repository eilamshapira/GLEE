Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and we can conclude the game immediately without any risk of inflation reducing our gains in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm not affected by inflation at all in this game, so there's no reason for me to accept less than a fair split. In fact, inflation is reducing the value of your share with each round, not mine. I'm offering you $4800 which, even with 10% inflation, is worth more to you now ($4320 in round 1 value) than what you'd get if we continue to another round and face additional inflation. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
