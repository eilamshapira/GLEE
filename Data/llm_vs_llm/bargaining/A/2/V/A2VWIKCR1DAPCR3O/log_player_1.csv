"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to make a fair offer to start. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a split where I get $45 and he gets $55. However, his $55 is worth 5% less than in Round 1, while my $45 is worth the same.

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer: $55 * (1 - 0.05) = $55 * 0.95 = $52.25

So, effectively, Bob is proposing a split of $45 for me and $52.25 for him. Since I believe I'm reasonable, and the total gain is $97.25, I will reject his offer and give myself a better gain.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Given that Bob rejected my slightly favorable offer in Round 1 and then offered me significantly less in Round 2 (accounting for inflation), I need to be more strategic. I also need to account for the fact that he's taking a bigger hit from inflation than I am.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 53,
  ""bob_gain"": 47
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob rejected my offer of 53/47. Now he's offering me $48, while his $52 is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the actual value of his offer:

$52 * (1 - 0.1426) = $52 * 0.8574 = $44.5848

So, he's proposing $48 for me and effectively $44.58 for him. That's a total ""value"" of $92.58.
Considering we're approaching the deadline and I'm getting $48 (which is still a decent amount), I'll accept to avoid getting nothing.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
