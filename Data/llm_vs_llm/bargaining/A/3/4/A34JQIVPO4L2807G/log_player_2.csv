"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 3000$ out of the 10,000$, which means she would get 7000$.

Given the inflation rule, if I reject now, the total worth to me will decrease by 20% in the next round. So instead of 10,000$, we'd be effectively dividing 8,000$ from my perspective. If I were to get 50% in the next round, that would be 4,000$, but with 20% inflation, it's worth only 3,200$ to me.

While Alice's offer of 3000$ is less than half, it might be better than what I could get in future rounds after inflation.
