"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer to maximize our chances of reaching an agreement early and to avoid the impact of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Since inflation will reduce the value of money with each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly."
