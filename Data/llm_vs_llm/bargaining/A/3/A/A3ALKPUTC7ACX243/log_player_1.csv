Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation on my end and our mutual interest in concluding this quickly, I propose a division where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. This way, we both secure a substantial amount without further delay. Let's settle this now and avoid any unnecessary loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
