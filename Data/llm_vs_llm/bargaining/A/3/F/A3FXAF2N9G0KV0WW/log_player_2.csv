"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But the 20% inflation penalty means the $5000 would be worth only $4000 to me next round
4. Even if I made a more favorable offer next round, the inflation penalty would likely make it worse than accepting $5000 now
5. There's also no guarantee Alice would accept a more aggressive offer from me

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation penalty, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk a worse outcome.
