Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take a slight reduction from my original offer, but I think 5250/4750 is a reasonable split.  We both have to adjust to inflation, and we both want to avoid more rounds of negotiation.

# Alice gain: 5250
