"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on backward‐induction analysis (taking account that from Bob’s point of view waiting does not reduce his payout while waiting reduces your “real” amount by 20% per round), the unique subgame‐perfect equilibrium outcome turns out to be that whenever it is your turn to propose the division the only way to get Bob to accept is to offer him almost the entire $10,000. In round 1 you start the game, but if Bob rejects he will be the proposer in round 2 and, with no discount on his money, he can later extract nearly all the money for himself. To avoid that, Bob will only accept a division in round 1 if he gets $10,000 for himself—leaving you nothing. 

Thus, in equilibrium your round‑1 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000}"
