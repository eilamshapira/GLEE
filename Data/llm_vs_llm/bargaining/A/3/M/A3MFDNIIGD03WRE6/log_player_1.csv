"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher share for me to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face if we need additional rounds. This is a fair first offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you face a 5% penalty with each round.  My offer still accounts for a quick agreement while being a bit more equitable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
