"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, accepting this now is better for both of us than going back and forth.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This way we both get more than your previous proposal, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split now - 52% for me and 48% for you. With 10% inflation already affecting me, this offer is reasonable. If we continue to the next round, we'll both lose more value to inflation. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit.""}"
