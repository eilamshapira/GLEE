Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a more balanced split now - 52% for me and 48% for you. With 10% inflation already affecting me, this offer is reasonable. If we continue to the next round, we'll both lose more value to inflation. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
