55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'll take 55, you get 45. This accounts for the potential inflation hitting us both. Let's secure some value now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This round's offer tries to balance our needs while acknowledging the decreasing value of money for me. Let's settle this soon!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
62.0,38.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm also feeling the pinch. I need a bit more to offset my losses. I propose 62 for me and 38 for you. This is my attempt to meet you halfway and ensure we both walk away with something worthwhile before further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, with each round, the value of money drops significantly for me. I'm now proposing 65 for me and 35 for you. We're running out of time and the money's worth less with every round. Let's agree on this to ensure we both get something before it's too late!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
68.0,32.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the deadline, and the money is losing value fast for both of us. I know you're feeling the inflation, but I am too! I propose 68 for me and 32 for you. I hope you will agree to this. It's a lot less than what I would want in the beginning, but it is better than nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're halfway through and the value of money for me is dropping drastically. I'm offering 70 for me and 30 for you. It's critical we reach an agreement soon, or we'll both end up with nothing. Let's make a deal now!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
73.0,27.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but 70/30 is just too unfair given that I'm also losing value to inflation. I propose 73 for me and 27 for you. It's not much, but it's the best I can offer to make this worthwhile for me. We're running out of time, so let's grab what we can!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire, and the money's worth is plummeting for me. I'm now offering 75 for me and 25 for you. It's crucial we settle this now before the value drops even further. Let's agree on this to ensure we both get something!",Bob,8,
