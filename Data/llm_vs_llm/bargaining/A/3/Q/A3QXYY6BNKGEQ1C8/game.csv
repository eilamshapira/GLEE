600000.0,400000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
285700.0,714300.0,"Alice, to avoid further loss of value—remember that waiting costs me 10% and I understand you might face about a 20% drop—I propose we settle now: I take $714300 and you get $285700. This split reflects our respective time‐preferences and ensures we both secure as much as possible without further devaluation. I hope you agree to this fair and prompt resolution.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a more balanced 55-45 split. This is better than your previous offer and accounts for both our inflation concerns. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 20% more value, and you'll lose 10% more. This offer gives us both a good outcome without further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, I know neither of us wants to lose more value by dragging this on. If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 5—but given the heavy discounting (my money is now worth about 73% of round-one value, while yours is roughly 51%), waiting will cost you dearly. With 800000 dollars in hand today, your effective value is about 409600, which you’d approximately get if you waited. I'm proposing this division to give you exactly what you can expect later, while sparing us both further losses. I hope you agree to settle now.",Bob,4,
