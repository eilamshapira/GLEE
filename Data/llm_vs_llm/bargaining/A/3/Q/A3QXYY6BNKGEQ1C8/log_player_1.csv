Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further loss of value—remember that waiting costs me 10% and I understand you might face about a 20% drop—I propose we settle now: I take $714300 and you get $285700. This split reflects our respective time‐preferences and ensures we both secure as much as possible without further devaluation. I hope you agree to this fair and prompt resolution. 
# Alice gain: 285700 
# Bob gain: 714300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unfavorable for me. Even with the 20% inflation penalty, I would get more value by making a counter-offer in the next round. Bob's offer would give me only $285,700, while even a 50-50 split in the next round would give me $400,000 (worth $320,000 to me after the 20% inflation). I'll take my chances with making a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know neither of us wants to lose more value by dragging this on. If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 5—but given the heavy discounting (my money is now worth about 73% of round-one value, while yours is roughly 51%), waiting will cost you dearly. With 800000 dollars in hand today, your effective value is about 409600, which you’d approximately get if you waited. I'm proposing this division to give you exactly what you can expect later, while sparing us both further losses. I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is actually a good offer from Bob. The $800,000 I would receive, even with the 48.8% inflation penalty, is worth about $409,600 in round 1 terms. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 5, I would face even steeper inflation (about 59% less value), making any potential gains less valuable. Additionally, Bob is offering me a much larger nominal amount than his previous offer. It's best to accept now rather than risk further devaluation of the money."
