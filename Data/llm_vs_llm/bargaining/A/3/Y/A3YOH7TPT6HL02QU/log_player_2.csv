"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, how about I take $60 and you take $40? I believe it's a fair offer considering my goals. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, considering the inflation risk, I'm being generous here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a fair and equal split of $50 each? This way we both share the impact of inflation evenly. Hope this works for you! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $50 I would gain is actually worth less than its original value. However, an equal split seems reasonable, and the inflation effect on Alice is less severe than on me.
