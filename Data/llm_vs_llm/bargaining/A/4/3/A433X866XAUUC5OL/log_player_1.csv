"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes inflation into account. Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs Bob's 5%), I should aim to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split where we each get $5,000. This is the simplest way to divide the money equally, and we can both walk away with a good amount right now without risking inflation reducing our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2400 
# Bob gain: 7600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try again with a more reasonable offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I propose I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm offering Bob more than half to incentivize a quick agreement, which benefits me more due to my higher inflation rate (20% vs Bob's 5%). If we keep going to later rounds, my share loses value faster, so I'm willing to take slightly less now for certainty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation rates and Bob's previous offers.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""bob_gain"": 6000}

I propose I get $4,000 and Bob gets $6,000. With my higher inflation rate (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), I need to reach an agreement soon. My $4,000 now is worth more to me than a potentially higher amount in future rounds after severe inflation. I'm giving Bob a significant majority of the money to incentivize acceptance, as continuing this negotiation is hurting both of us, but me more severely due to the differing inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
