"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $4,500 and Alice $5,500
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means her $5,500 next round would only be worth $4,950 to her
5. I could potentially make a better offer for myself in the next round

Given that Alice will value money less in the next round, I can probably negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice values money 10% less this round, I can propose a split that gives me more while still being attractive to her due to the devaluation.

In round 1, Alice would have gotten $5,500 (worth full value to her then). Now in round 2, to match that value for her, I only need to offer her about $6,111 (because $6,111 at 90% value â‰ˆ $5,500).

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more while still being acceptable to Alice given the depreciation:

{""bob_gain"": 4300, ""alice_gain"": 5700}

This offer gives Alice $5,700 (worth $5,130 to her now), which is still reasonably close to what she would have gotten in her first offer. If she rejects, her money will be worth even less next round, so this should be attractive enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. For me, this is worth full value: $5,000
3. For Alice, due to 19% inflation, her $5,000 is only worth $4,050
4. This is better than Alice's first offer to me ($4,500)
5. If I reject, Alice's money will be worth even less next round (29% less)
6. The deal is quite favorable to me now

This is a good offer for me because:
- I get more than in round 1 ($5,000 vs $4,500)
- Alice is already taking a significant hit due to inflation
- Further negotiations might make Alice less cooperative
