"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the game.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint outcome and prevents value loss through inflation."
