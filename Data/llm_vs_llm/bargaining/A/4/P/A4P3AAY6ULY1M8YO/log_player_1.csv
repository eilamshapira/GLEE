"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob declines, inflation will start affecting future rounds, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45, but with 5% inflation, that's worth $42.75 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- Bob seems to be affected by higher inflation (20%), which could give me leverage in later rounds
- However, the risk of continuing negotiations with declining value for both parties is significant

Given that this is still a relatively early round and Bob is more affected by inflation than I am, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I now know that Bob is affected by higher inflation (20% already) compared to my 5%, I can use this to my advantage. However, I also need to be reasonable to avoid too many rounds of declining value.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. Given that Bob's inflation is higher than mine, this offer should be more appealing to him than continuing further rounds where his share would be worth even less. For me, with only 5% inflation so far, $60 is still worth $57, which is better than the previous offer."
