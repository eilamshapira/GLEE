Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to being fair, the inflation is hurting Alice's potential gains more than mine. It's still beneficial for me to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even reaching round 12 with no agreement."
