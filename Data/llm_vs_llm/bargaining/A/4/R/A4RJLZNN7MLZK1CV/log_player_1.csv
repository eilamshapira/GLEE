"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game and the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself. I'm aware of the time decay factor. I hope Bob will find this reasonable enough to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. Let's analyze this with the inflation in mind:

*   **My gain (Alice):** $35 * 0.80 = $28 (due to 20% inflation)
*   **Bob's gain:** $65 * 0.95 = $61.75 (due to 5% inflation)

While Bob's nominal offer gives him a larger share, the inflation significantly impacts my take. Accepting this would mean I only get $28. Considering the risk of further inflation in the next round, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
