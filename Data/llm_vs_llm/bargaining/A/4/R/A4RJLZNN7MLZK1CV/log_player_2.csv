"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value will be worth 20% less to Alice (more pressure on her)
   * The total value will be worth 5% less to me (small impact)
   * I could potentially get a better deal

Since Alice's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I have more bargaining power if we go to the next round. I could propose a more favorable split, and Alice would be under more pressure to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it given her higher depreciation rate. If she rejects this, the money will be worth 20% less to her in the next round, while only 5% less to me.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because:
1. It's better for me than the original 40/60 split
2. For Alice, accepting 35 now is better than getting a similar amount in the next round when it's worth 20% less to her
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or spiteful"
