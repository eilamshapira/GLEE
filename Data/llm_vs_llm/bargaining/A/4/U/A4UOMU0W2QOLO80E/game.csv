10000.0,0.0,"Bob, here’s the deal: I'll take the entire $10000 if you agree now. Since every delay costs you 10% per round while my share stays intact, waiting leaves you with nothing extra. If you reject, you’ll be forced to propose in a round where your money’s value drops by 10%—effectively leaving you with nothing. So, accepting this offer is in your best interest.",Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I believe a fair division should reflect both our positions. I propose taking $4500 for myself and giving you $5500. This way, you receive a larger share, acknowledging that my value decreases each round. Let's reach an agreement that respects both our interests.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
9999.0,1.0,"Bob, if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in the next round—however, due to inflation, your share will drop even further. In fact, if we reach that stage, you'll end up with nothing since I can secure the entire $10000 in my proposal. This $1 may seem small, but it's strictly better than the inevitable loss. Accept this offer now and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Alice, here's a proposal aimed at achieving balance. I'll claim $2500 and you'll receive $7500. This division considers my decreased value due to inflation, while still offering you a substantial majority. I urge you to agree, allowing us both to end with favorable outcomes.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
9999.0,1.0,"Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll propose in Round 6, but by then your money suffers even more from inflation (about 59% of nominal value) and you'll be forced to give me almost the entire pie in order to get me to agree. This offer gives you a guaranteed positive amount—albeit small—before the depreciation takes an even harsher toll on your gains. Please accept this division.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Alice, I understand the situation but I propose to claim $1000 and give you $9000. This acknowledges both the current inflation impact on my side and your stable valuation. This offer should appeal to both our interests and finalize our negotiation productively.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5217.0,4783.0,"Bob, consider your position if you reject this offer. In Round 8 you would become the proposer, but any money you secure then will be devalued by roughly 52.17%, leaving you with an effective payoff of about $4783 if you claim nearly the whole pie. To avoid that loss, I’m offering you $4783 now at full value, allowing me to keep $5217. This offer matches your best alternative while sparing you further depreciation. Let’s settle now and avoid the inevitable discount.",Alice,7,
