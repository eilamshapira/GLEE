"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 10000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, here’s the deal: I'll take the entire $10,000 if you agree now. Since every delay costs you 10% per round while my share stays intact, waiting leaves you with nothing extra. If you reject, you’ll be forced to propose in a round where your money’s value drops by 10%—effectively leaving you with nothing. So, accepting this offer is in your best interest.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a fair division should reflect both our positions. I propose taking $4500 for myself and giving you $5500. This way, you receive a larger share, acknowledging that my value decreases each round. Let's reach an agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500

Round 3

In fact, if we reach that stage, you'll end up with nothing since I can secure the entire $10,000 in my proposal. This $1 may seem small, but it's strictly better than the inevitable loss. Accept this offer now and avoid further devaluation.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's a proposal aimed at achieving balance. I'll claim $2500 and you'll receive $7500. This division considers my decreased value due to inflation, while still offering you a substantial majority. I urge you to agree, allowing us both to end with favorable outcomes.

Round 5

This offer gives you a guaranteed positive amount—albeit small—before the depreciation takes an even harsher toll on your gains. Please accept this division.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the situation but I propose to claim $1000 and give you $9000. This acknowledges both the current inflation impact on my side and your stable valuation. This offer should appeal to both our interests and finalize our negotiation productively.

In Round 8 you would become the proposer, but any money you secure then will be devalued by roughly 52.17%, leaving you with an effective payoff of about $4783 if you claim nearly the whole pie. To avoid that loss, I’m offering you $4783 now at full value, allowing me to keep $5217. This offer matches your best alternative while sparing you further depreciation. Let’s settle now and avoid the inevitable discount.""}"
