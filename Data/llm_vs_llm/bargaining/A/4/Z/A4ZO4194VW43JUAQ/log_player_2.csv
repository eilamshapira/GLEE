"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing a 50/50 split, which would give each of us $50. This is a perfectly fair and equal division of the money. Since there's no inflation affecting my value (0% inflation for me), I don't lose anything by accepting now rather than negotiating further.

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's also risk in prolonging the game, and a 50/50 split is objectively fair.
