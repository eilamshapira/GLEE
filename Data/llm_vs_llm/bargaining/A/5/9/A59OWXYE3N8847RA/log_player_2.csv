"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $1000 while she gets $9000
2. This is a 10/90 split, which is quite unfair
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
5. Still, with such an uneven split, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the 5% inflation that affects my share:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50. This way we both get a substantial amount and can finish the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's split it evenly this time to speed things up. We both get a good chunk and avoid further inflation! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice now proposes a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is much fairer than the initial 10/90 split
3. Due to 9.75% inflation, my $5000 is effectively worth $4,512.50
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but:
   - The inflation will increase to around 15%
   - Alice is showing willingness to negotiate fairly
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept an even better offer
5. Given the mounting inflation and the fair split, this is a reasonable offer
