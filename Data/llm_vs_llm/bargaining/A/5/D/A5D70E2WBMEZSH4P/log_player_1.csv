Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
