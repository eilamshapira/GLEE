"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45.  Given the potential for inflation, this seems like a good starting point for us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
