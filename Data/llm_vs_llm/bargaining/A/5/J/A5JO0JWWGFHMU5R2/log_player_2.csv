"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000 (20%)
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * The total value to me would be $800,000
   * I would get to make the next proposal
3. This first offer seems quite low, giving Alice 80% of the money
4. I can likely get a better deal even with the inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's favorable for both of us. If you reject, remember that another round means more value lost to inflation. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm offering a more equitable split (55-45)
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face another round where:
   - For me, the money will be worth 40% less
   - She may also face inflation penalties
3. This offer is much more reasonable than the initial 20-80 split
4. The message emphasizes mutual benefit and reminds about inflation risks"
