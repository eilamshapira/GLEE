"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is objectively fair
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
4. However, I know my money won't lose value next round, but I don't know about Alice's situation
5. Since I'm getting a fair offer and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal next round, accepting seems wise
