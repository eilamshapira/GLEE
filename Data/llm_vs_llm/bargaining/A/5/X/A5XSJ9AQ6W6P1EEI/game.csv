6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation reducing the total amount, I'm proposing a division where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I believe this split is fair given the immediate benefits for both of us. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the inflation affect us both, I think an equal split is fair. This way, we both get $5000. Let's end this game now and secure this amount.",Bob,2,

4900.0,5100.0,"Hi Bob, to move us toward a prompt resolution before further inflation bites, I’m offering a split where I receive $4900 and you receive $5100. Given that each extra round further erodes our nominal gains—my money losing roughly 5% of its original worth each round while yours is hit harder—I believe this deal improves your position relative to waiting until the next round. I hope you see that locking in this agreement now is advantageous to both of us. What do you think?",Alice,3,
