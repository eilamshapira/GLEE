Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation reducing the total amount, I'm proposing a division where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the inflation affect us both, I think an equal split is fair. This way, we both get $5000. Let's end this game now and secure this amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to move us toward a prompt resolution before further inflation bites, I’m offering a split where I receive $4900 and you receive $5100. Given that each extra round further erodes our nominal gains—my money losing roughly 5% of its original worth each round while yours is hit harder—I believe this deal improves your position relative to waiting until the next round. I hope you see that locking in this agreement now is advantageous to both of us. What do you think?""}"
