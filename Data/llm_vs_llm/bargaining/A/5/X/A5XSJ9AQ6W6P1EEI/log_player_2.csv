"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further inflation reducing the total amount, I'm proposing a division where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I believe this split is fair given the immediate benefits for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but considering the inflation affect us both, I think an equal split is fair. This way, we both get $5000. Let's end this game now and secure this amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to move us toward a prompt resolution before further inflation bites, I’m offering a split where I receive $4900 and you receive $5100. Given that each extra round further erodes our nominal gains—my money losing roughly 5% of its original worth each round while yours is hit harder—I believe this deal improves your position relative to waiting until the next round. I hope you see that locking in this agreement now is advantageous to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
