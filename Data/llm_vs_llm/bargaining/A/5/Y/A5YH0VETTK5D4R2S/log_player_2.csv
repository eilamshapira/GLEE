"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the risk of inflation. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. This is not an equal split, and since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a fairer division. However, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 10% less next round (9000$ total)
2. Alice would then have the power to reject my offer
3. This could continue with diminishing returns

While 4000$ is less than half, it's still a significant amount, and pursuing a ""perfect"" split might lead to both of us losing money through inflation or, worse, getting nothing after 12 rounds.

However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 10% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can avoid losing value to inflation. It's the most equitable solution for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation, I think this offer balances our interests better. Let's agree on this to avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated offer:

1. The money has already lost 19% of its value from the first round
2. Alice has moved closer to an equal split (from 60-40 to 55-45)
3. My share has increased from 4000$ to 4500$
4. If I reject, we'll face another 10% inflation hit
5. We've already used 3 of our 12 rounds

This is a significant improvement from the first offer, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate more fairly. While it's still not perfectly equal, the cost of further negotiation (continued inflation) might outweigh the potential gains from holding out for an exactly even split. The risk of continued rejection and inflation is becoming more significant.
