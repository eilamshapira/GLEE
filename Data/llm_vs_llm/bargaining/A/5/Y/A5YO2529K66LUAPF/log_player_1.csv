Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough decision point, but I need to try and hold out a bit longer. Accepting now means a very small share. Bob's ""final offer"" language is likely a bluff."

# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting dangerously close, but I still hold out hope that Bob will be a little more reasonable. He has to know that I'll get almost nothing if this goes to the final rounds."

I'm pushing it close, but with only a few rounds left, I need to signal that I'm willing to settle but won't accept anything less than this."
