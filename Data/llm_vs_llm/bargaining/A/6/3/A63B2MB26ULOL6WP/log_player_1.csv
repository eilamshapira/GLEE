"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the offer.

*   **Alice's effective gain in Round 1:** $600,000
*   **Alice's gain in Round 2:** $450,000
*   **Inflation impact:** My money is worth 5% less now.

I need to calculate the equivalent value of the round 2 offer compared to round 1 offer. In this case, I need to calculate the real value of the offer in the first round.

*   **Effective value in round 2** = 450000 / 0.95 = 473684.21$

Comparing the value in the first round ($600,000) with the offer of the second round ($473684.21), I can see that the offer is not good for me.

Therefore, I must reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account that my money is worth less due to inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's gain in Round 4:** $480,000
*   **Inflation impact (cumulative):** 14.26% less than round 1.

Let's calculate the value of the gain compared to the offer in the first round.

*   **Effective value in round 4** = 480000 / (1 - 0.1426) = 560000.00$

Comparing the value in the first round ($600,000) with the offer of the second round ($560,000), I can see that the offer is not good for me.

Therefore, I must reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. The inflation is continuing to erode the value of my potential gains.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's break down this offer.

*   **Alice's gain in Round 6:** $500,000
*   **Inflation impact (cumulative):** 22.62% less than round 1.

Let's calculate the value of the gain compared to the offer in the first round.

*   **Effective value in round 6** = 500000 / (1 - 0.2262) = 645988.23$

Comparing the value in the first round ($600,000) with the offer of the sixth round ($645988.23), I can see that the offer is better than the offer in round 1.

So, I must accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
