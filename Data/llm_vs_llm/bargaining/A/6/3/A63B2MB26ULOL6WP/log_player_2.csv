Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn. Considering the potential for inflation and the limited rounds, I'll propose a more balanced split to increase the chances of reaching an agreement.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm asking for $550,000, leaving $450,000 for Alice. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer, and hopefully, she'll find it reasonable enough to accept, avoiding further inflation. It's a bit more for me to account for inflation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is starting to bite, so I need to be strategic. I'll sweeten the deal for Alice a little to try and secure an agreement.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I've reduced my ask to $520,000, increasing Alice's share to $480,000. This is a more favorable offer for Alice compared to my previous one, and I hope it's enough to convince her to accept. The inflation is hurting me, and I want to avoid losing even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 6. Inflation is really starting to hurt. I need to be careful, but I also need to get a decent share. I'll try to find a middle ground.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm offering an even split: $500,000 for me and $500,000 for Alice. This seems the fairest option given the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, she'll see reason and accept."
