"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Prolonging this only risks losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
