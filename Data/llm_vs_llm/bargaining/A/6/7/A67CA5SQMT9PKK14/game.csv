60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I lose 5% value with each passing round, so I need a higher portion to account for inflation. If we delay, we both risk getting less value.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, a 60-40 split feels too unbalanced to me. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the inflation factor while ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I need to emphasize that I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty each round. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% value, making it worse for me. Let's reach an agreement now.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation you're facing while ensuring a more balanced outcome. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more value to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but we need to finalize this. I'm now offering a 52-48 split in my favor. By round 5, I've already lost nearly 20% of the money's value due to inflation. This split acknowledges both of our positions - you're getting very close to 50%, and I'm getting a small premium to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's agree now before more value is lost.",Alice,5,
