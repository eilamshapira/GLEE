"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I lose 5% value with each passing round, so I need a higher portion to account for inflation. If we delay, we both risk getting less value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, a 60-40 split feels too unbalanced to me. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the inflation factor while ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I need to emphasize that I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty each round. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% value, making it worse for me. Let's reach an agreement now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation you're facing while ensuring a more balanced outcome. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer, but we need to finalize this. I'm now offering a 52-48 split in my favor. By round 5, I've already lost nearly 20% of the money's value due to inflation. This split acknowledges both of our positions - you're getting very close to 50%, and I'm getting a small premium to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's agree now before more value is lost.""}"
