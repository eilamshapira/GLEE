"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I lose 5% value with each passing round, so I need a higher portion to account for inflation. If we delay, we both risk getting less value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, a 60-40 split feels too unbalanced to me. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the inflation factor while ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I need to emphasize that I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty each round. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% value, making it worse for me. Let's reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I understand Alice's point about inflation, but her offer still heavily favors her.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where the deal becomes significantly disadvantageous for me.  It seems like Alice might be exaggerating the impact of inflation on her end to pressure me into accepting a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation you're facing while ensuring a more balanced outcome. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer, but we need to finalize this. I'm now offering a 52-48 split in my favor. By round 5, I've already lost nearly 20% of the money's value due to inflation. This split acknowledges both of our positions - you're getting very close to 50%, and I'm getting a small premium to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's agree now before more value is lost. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is now bordering on unfavorable for me considering the round we're in.  It's still better to accept something rather than risk ending up with nothing."
