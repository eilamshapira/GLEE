344827.0,655173.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 so that I receive $344827 and you receive $655173. With each round the money loses value—mine by 10% and yours by 5%—so delaying only hurts us extra. I believe this fair split reflects what each can expect in future rounds, and I’d appreciate your acceptance now.",Alice,1,
