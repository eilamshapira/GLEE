"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 344827, ""bob_gain"": 655173, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1,000,000 so that I receive $344,827 and you receive $655,173. With each round the money loses value—mine by 10% and yours by 5%—so delaying only hurts us extra. I believe this fair split reflects what each can expect in future rounds, and I’d appreciate your acceptance now.""}"
