"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 so that I receive $344827 and you receive $655173. With each round the money loses value—mine by 10% and yours by 5%—so delaying only hurts us extra. I believe this fair split reflects what each can expect in future rounds, and I’d appreciate your acceptance now. 
# Bob gain: 655173 
# Alice gain: 344827 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $655,173 (65.5%) and Alice gets $344,827 (34.5%)

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But the total value will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
- $1M will be worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice

3. Alice's reasoning is sound:
- She acknowledges the time pressure
- The split is in my favor
- She's offering me nearly 2/3 of the money

4. This is actually a good deal because:
- I get the majority share
- Waiting would reduce the value for both of us
- Future negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome
- The split roughly reflects our different depreciation rates
