"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation rates. If I reject this offer, the total value decreases, but I'll get to make a counter-offer. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs Alice's 10%), delaying is more costly for me than for Alice.
