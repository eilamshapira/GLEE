"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation effect.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering a slightly higher split for myself because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me. This is a fair first offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we both want to conclude quickly, a 50-50 split seems fair. Considering my 5% inflation, I'm willing to settle for half to avoid further loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. The 50-50 split proposed by Bob isn't accounting for the difference in our inflation rates. For me, each round reduces the value by 20%, while Bob only faces 5% inflation. 

If I reject and we go to round 3, the $100 will be worth even less to me (another 20% reduction), making it more urgent for me to conclude the deal now rather than later.

While I would have preferred a split that accounts for our different inflation rates, the 50-50 split is reasonable given that Bob will likely demand an even greater share if we continue to round 3.
