Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering a slightly higher split for myself because I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me. This is a fair first offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
