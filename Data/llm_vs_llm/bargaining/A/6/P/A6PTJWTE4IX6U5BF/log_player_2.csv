"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. This division favors her, but it's not extremely unfair. If I reject, I can propose something more favorable to me in the next round, but Alice could then reject my offer and we'd continue negotiating.

Since this is a decent offer (40% of the total), and there's no guarantee that prolonging the negotiation will result in a better outcome for me, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split, which is the fairest way to divide the amount. An even 50-50 division ensures that both Alice and I receive the same share of the money."
