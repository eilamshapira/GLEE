"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because it's a reasonable starting point that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining my advantage. If Bob rejects this, their share will be worth less in the next round due to the 10% inflation penalty they face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4095 
# Bob gain: 5905 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob is offering me $4,095, which is significantly less than my initial offer of $6,000. While Bob is taking a larger share ($5,905), it's important to remember that for Bob, this amount is already worth 10% less than it would have been in round 1.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make another offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less to them due to the continuing 10% inflation penalty they face. This gives me stronger negotiating power in the next round.

Given that I have this advantage and the current offer is significantly lower than what I believe I can get, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial 60-40 split and countered with roughly a 41-59 split (which I rejected), I'll adjust my offer slightly but maintain a strong position given my inflation advantage. Bob's money is now worth 20% less than in round 1, which strengthens my negotiating position.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal to Bob compared to my first offer, but still maintaining a strong position for myself. Given that Bob's share is now worth 20% less to them due to inflation, they might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation of their share."
