30.74,69.26,"Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now: I take $30.74 and you get $69.26. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer next round—but due to our different discount rates (my money loses 20% per round and yours 10%), the pie shrinks and your future advantage won’t make up for waiting. I believe this fair split—rooted in backward‐induction reasoning—is best for us both. Let’s agree now and avoid needless losses.",Alice,1,
