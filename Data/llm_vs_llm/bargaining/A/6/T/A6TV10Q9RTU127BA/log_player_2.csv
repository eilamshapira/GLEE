"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now: I take $30.74 and you get $69.26. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer next round—but due to our different discount rates (my money loses 20% per round and yours 10%), the pie shrinks and your future advantage won’t make up for waiting. I believe this fair split—rooted in backward‐induction reasoning—is best for us both. Let’s agree now and avoid needless losses. 
# Bob gain: 69.26 
# Alice gain: 30.74 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
