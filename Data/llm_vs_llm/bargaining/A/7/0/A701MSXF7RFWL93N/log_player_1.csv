Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the value loss over time. Let's settle this round to minimize further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Given the inflation penalties and the uncertainties ahead, I believe your offer is reasonable. I accept your offer of $4500 to me and $5500 to you for this round.""}"
