"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me, considering that the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. Let's divide the money equally and both walk away with $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
