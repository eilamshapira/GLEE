"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of the $1,000,000, giving each of us $500,000.

However, I should remember that inflation affects me at 5% per round, while it doesn't affect Alice. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me will be worth 5% less, or $950,000 in effective value.

Given that a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and rejecting would reduce the total value available to me, I should accept this offer.
