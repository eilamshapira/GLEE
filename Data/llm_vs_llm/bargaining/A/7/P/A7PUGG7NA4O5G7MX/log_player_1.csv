"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a reasonable offer to Bob that accounts for the inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round, it's in both our interests to agree now. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for me, but not for you, which is why I'm asking for slightly more than half.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting you more than me. However, since I don't face any inflation penalty, waiting another round doesn't affect me. For you, the $100 is now worth only $95. My offer of $40 to you is actually worth more to you now than $42 would be in the next round due to your 5% inflation. This is a fair deal considering our different positions, and I hope you'll accept it so we can both walk away with something worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your consideration but I had to reject the previous offer. With each round, I lose 5% value while you lose nothing, putting me at a disadvantage. This 52/48 split accounts for that asymmetric risk and actually gives you more than my initial offer. If we continue to the next round, I'd need to ask for even more to compensate for the inflation. This is a fair compromise considering our different positions.""}"
