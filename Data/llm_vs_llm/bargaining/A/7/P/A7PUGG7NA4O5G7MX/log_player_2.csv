"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round, it's in both our interests to agree now. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for me, but not for you, which is why I'm asking for slightly more than half. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer given our different inflation rates.

Alice's offer is $45 for me and $55 for her. She correctly notes that she faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I face 0% inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, the $100 will still be worth $100 to me in the next round, but it will only be worth $95 to Alice. This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

Since I don't lose value by waiting and Alice does, I should reject this offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll craft an offer that takes into account our different inflation positions while still being fair enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting you more than me. However, since I don't face any inflation penalty, waiting another round doesn't affect me. For you, the $100 is now worth only $95. My offer of $40 to you is actually worth more to you now than $42 would be in the next round due to your 5% inflation. This is a fair deal considering our different positions, and I hope you'll accept it so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your consideration but I had to reject the previous offer. With each round, I lose 5% value while you lose nothing, putting me at a disadvantage. This 52/48 split accounts for that asymmetric risk and actually gives you more than my initial offer. If we continue to the next round, I'd need to ask for even more to compensate for the inflation. This is a fair compromise considering our different positions. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully considering our inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $48 and taking $52. She's right that the money is worth less to her with each round due to her 5% inflation penalty, while it maintains the same value for me.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another proposal. However, by then, Alice's inflation penalty will have increased further (to about 15%), making the deal even worse for her.

Alice's current offer of $48 for me is better than her initial offer of $45. She appears to be moving toward a more equitable split despite her disadvantageous position with inflation.

Given that I've already improved from $45 to $48, and considering that continued negotiation might lead Alice to reject my next offer (potentially resulting in more rounds and a worse outcome for both of us), accepting this offer seems reasonable.
