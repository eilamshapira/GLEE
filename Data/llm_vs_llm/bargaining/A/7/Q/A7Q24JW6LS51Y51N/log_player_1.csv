"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that I think is fair.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which means we each get $500,000. This is the fairest division, as we both receive equal amounts and can end the game immediately without risking the value decreasing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's not balanced enough in my view. Since Bob rejected my fair 50-50 split, I'll have a chance to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose a compromise where I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000. Since Bob is experiencing inflation that reduces the value of his gains by 20% each round, this offer still gives him substantial value while being more fair to me than his previous offer. This way we can reach an agreement without further delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Bob is now experiencing significant inflation (48.8% less value than round 1), yet is still asking for a large portion of the money. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 425000, ""bob_gain"": 575000}

I propose a new division where I receive $425,000 and Bob receives $575,000. This offer gives Bob a larger share to compensate for his inflation concerns, while still being more balanced than his previous offer. Given the increasing inflation Bob is experiencing, this should be a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with substantial value rather than continuing negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
