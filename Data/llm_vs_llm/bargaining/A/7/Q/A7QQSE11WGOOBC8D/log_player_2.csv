"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50/50 split, giving us each $50. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will decrease - it will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice.

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice in the next round. This means even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $50 to make up for the 10% inflation.

A 50/50 split is fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face, accepting now is better than trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal in future rounds.
