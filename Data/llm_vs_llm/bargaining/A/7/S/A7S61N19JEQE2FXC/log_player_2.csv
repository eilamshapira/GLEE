"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.
Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, my gain of 45 is actually worth actually 45 * 0.81 = 36.45.
For Alice, the money is worth 36% less, so her gain of 55 is actually worth 55 * 0.64 = 35.2.
Given this, I'll make my decision.
