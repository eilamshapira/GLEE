"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this 50-50 split is fair given our different inflation rates. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the total value will decrease by 20% for me and 5% for Alice.

Let me analyze: If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $80 to me and $95 to Alice in the next round. Given this asymmetric inflation, a 50-50 split now might be better than what I could achieve later.
