"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation hurts you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), so you have more incentive to accept early. If we go to round 2, the total value drops to $80 for me and $60 for you, making us both worse off. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
- The money is worth 20% less to me (×0.8): $100 × 0.8 = $80 total value for me
- The money is worth 10% less for Alice (×0.9): $100 × 0.9 = $90 total value for Alice

Alice makes a good point about the inflation asymmetry putting me at a disadvantage. If I reject, not only do I lose 20% value, but Alice's stronger negotiating position (due to lower inflation rate) means she might not accept a better offer from me in round 2.

$40 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds after inflation.
