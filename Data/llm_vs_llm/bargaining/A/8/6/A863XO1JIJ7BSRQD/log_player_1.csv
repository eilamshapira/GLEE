"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob rejected my initial offer, it's now his turn to propose a division. Considering the inflation, the actual values for this round would be:

For me (Alice): 400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000 (due to 5% less value)
For Bob: 600,000 * 0.80 = 480,000 (due to 20% less value)

Given this offer, I think it's not in my favor since I'd be getting less than half of the adjusted value.

My response: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer wasn't favorable to me, it's now my turn again to propose a division. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now:

For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so it's 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.64 of the original value.

To make a more attractive offer to Bob while still being reasonable for myself, I'll try to find a balance. Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation:

For me (Alice): 420,000 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = 359,908.80 (due to 14.26% less value)
For Bob: 580,000 * 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = 296,960 (due to 48.8% less value)

Given this offer, I'm still not satisfied with getting less than half of the adjusted value, and the difference in value due to inflation is becoming more significant.

My response: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer wasn't acceptable to me, it's now my turn again to propose a division. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now:

For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's 0.8574 * 0.95 = 0.8145 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so it's 0.512 * 0.80 = 0.4096 of the original value.

To make a more attractive offer to Bob while still being reasonable for myself, I'll try to find a balance. Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This time, I'm offering an equal split, considering the significant decrease in value for Bob. Let's see how Bob responds!"
