"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob. Since we're in the first round and I know there's no inflation affecting my value, I'll propose a fair split while slightly favoring myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage but still provides Bob with a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, he'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer considering what I've learned. Since I know Bob is experiencing 5% inflation per round and I'm not affected by inflation, I can adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than my previous offer since I understand he's facing inflation pressure. This is still favorable to me but gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal, which should make it more attractive for him to accept rather than going to another round where his money will be worth even less."
