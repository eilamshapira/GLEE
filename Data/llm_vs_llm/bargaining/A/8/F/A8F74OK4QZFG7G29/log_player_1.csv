"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I will start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement before inflation takes a significant toll.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer isn't great considering the inflation I'm experiencing, but rejecting it would mean further losses. Let me calculate the perceived value of Bob's offer.

*   Original offer to me: $60
*   Bob's current offer to me: $45
*   Inflation: 20%

Value of Bob's offer after inflation: $45 / (1 - 0.20) = $56.25

Since $56.25 is still less than my initial offer of $60, I will try to secure a better deal in the next round when it's my turn to propose. Therefore, I reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to balance getting a fair share with the increasing impact of inflation on my gains. I'll aim for a split that still gives me a slightly larger portion while being reasonable enough to be accepted.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
