"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 each. Given that inflation will reduce the value of my money by 10% each round, accepting now would give me the full $5,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the total pot's value to me will already be reduced by 10%.
