"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low, especially considering I lose 10% value each round. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm lowering my request slightly to show willingness to compromise, but still need a higher share to offset the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is even worse than before, and with the mounting inflation penalty (now over 27%), I need a better share to make it worthwhile. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm making a more modest proposal to try to reach an agreement, given that further delays hurt my position due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting worse, not better, and even with the severe inflation penalty (now 41%), accepting just $30 would give me too little value. I'll make another counter-offer, but we need to reach agreement soon as the inflation is severely hurting my position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a completely fair 50-50 split. With inflation already at 46% for my share, we really need to reach an agreement soon, and this is a very reasonable compromise."
