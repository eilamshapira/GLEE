"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ in the first round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. 

400,000$ now is better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less due to inflation. Also, if we keep going back and forth for too many rounds, we risk getting nothing.

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", 40% of the total is still a substantial amount, and accepting now avoids the risk of inflation eating into my gains.
