300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I believe it's in our mutual interest to settle quickly. With potential inflation risks looming (especially on your end), delaying might diminish the value you ultimately receive. I'm proposing 700K for me and 300K for you as a swift resolution. What do you say?",Bob,2,

480000.0,520000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this. Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'm adjusting my offer. Considering the inflation, I'll take slightly less than last time, but still more than what you offered. Let's finalize this and move on.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your adjustment in light of inflation, the split still undervalues my position. I believe we can achieve a fairer deal in the next round. Let's proceed, and I'll present a revised offer.",Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I know you're conscious of the inflation hit on your share and want to avoid further losses. If we delay any longer, your portion might suffer even more erosion. I'm offering you $475K now—which, even adjusted for inflation, is nearly as good as your previous effective outcome—while I receive $525K. Let's finalize this deal today for our mutual benefit.",Bob,4,
