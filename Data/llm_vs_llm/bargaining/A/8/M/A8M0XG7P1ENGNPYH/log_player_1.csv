Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe it's in our mutual interest to settle quickly. With potential inflation risks looming (especially on your end), delaying might diminish the value you ultimately receive. I'm proposing 700K for me and 300K for you as a swift resolution. What do you say?

# Bob gain: 700000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you're conscious of the inflation hit on your share and want to avoid further losses. If we delay any longer, your portion might suffer even more erosion. I'm offering you $475K now—which, even adjusted for inflation, is nearly as good as your previous effective outcome—while I receive $525K. Let's finalize this deal today for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
