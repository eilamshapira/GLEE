"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'm adjusting my offer. Considering the inflation, I'll take slightly less than last time, but still more than what you offered. Let's finalize this and move on.

# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your adjustment in light of inflation, the split still undervalues my position. I believe we can achieve a fairer deal in the next round. Let's proceed, and I'll present a revised offer.""}"
