"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000.

Since there's no inflation for me, the money's value doesn't decrease over rounds. This means there's no strategic advantage for me to rush to accept an offer based on inflation concerns.

However, without knowing how inflation affects Alice, it's hard to predict if she'll become more generous in later rounds. Given this uncertainty, a fair 50-50 split is quite reasonable.
