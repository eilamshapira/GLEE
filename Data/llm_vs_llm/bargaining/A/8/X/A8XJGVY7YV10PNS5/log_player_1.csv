"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's fair and you won't lose anything. Next round, the money will be worth less for me, so it's in both our interests to end it here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is now worth 10% less, I can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is now worth 10% less to him, and it will be worth even less in the next round, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value for you, this is a reasonable offer. Don't wait for further devaluation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value of money for me. It's better for both of us to end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less to Bob, I have a stronger negotiating position. However, I should also consider that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to Bob in the next round, but I still want to get a good deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55 for me and 45 for him, and considering the money is worth even less to him now (27.1% less than the initial value, and it will be 37.4% less after this round if he rejects), I'll try to make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 70, 
""bob_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""This is my final offer, don't let the value drop further!""}"
