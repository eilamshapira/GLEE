"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer for the first round, considering that both Bob and I have equal bargaining power and that there's a 10% inflation penalty for each round that passes.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split that avoids the risk of inflation reducing the total value for both of us. I believe this fair division gives us both the maximum possible value without risking devaluation through further rounds of negotiation."
