4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and have plenty of time to negotiate.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial 60-40 split. Due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to secure a slightly higher nominal amount to achieve a fair outcome. This 58-42 split is more balanced than my first offer while accounting for my inflation disadvantage.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"It's time for an equal split, considering the inflation penalty you're facing and the fact that we're running out of time. This way, we both get a fair share without further risking our potential gains.",Bob,4,
