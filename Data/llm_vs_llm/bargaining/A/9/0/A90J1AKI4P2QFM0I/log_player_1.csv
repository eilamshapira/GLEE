"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and have plenty of time to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty makes this offer less attractive for me than it appears. My $4500 is actually worth $4275 due to the 5% inflation in round 2. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial 60-40 split. Due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to secure a slightly higher nominal amount to achieve a fair outcome. This 58-42 split is more balanced than my first offer while accounting for my inflation disadvantage.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time for an equal split, considering the inflation penalty you're facing and the fact that we're running out of time. This way, we both get a fair share without further risking our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this 50-50 split. While my $5000 is actually worth around $4287 due to the 14.26% inflation penalty, continuing to negotiate could lead to even worse outcomes due to increasing inflation. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
