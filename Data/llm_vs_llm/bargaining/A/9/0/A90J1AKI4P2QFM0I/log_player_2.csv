Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial 60-40 split. Due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to secure a slightly higher nominal amount to achieve a fair outcome. This 58-42 split is more balanced than my first offer while accounting for my inflation disadvantage.

# Alice gain: 5800
