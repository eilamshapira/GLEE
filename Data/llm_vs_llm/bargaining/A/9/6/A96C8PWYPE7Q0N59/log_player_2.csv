"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any future devaluation (I'm facing a 5% drop each round), I'd like to settle now. I propose that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000 from the $10000 pot. I believe this is a fair division that rewards prompt agreement. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, I don't have any information about Alice's inflation rate, but I do know that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round. Considering this, I think it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer, as $4000 now is better than potentially less in the future.
