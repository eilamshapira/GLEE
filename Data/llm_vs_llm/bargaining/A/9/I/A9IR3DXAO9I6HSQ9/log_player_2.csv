"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me only 20% of the total amount ($2000), which seems quite unfair. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
1. The money will be worth 5% less for me (so $9500 total value)
2. For Alice, it will be worth 20% less ($8000 total value)

Since Alice is more heavily impacted by inflation, I have negotiating leverage. I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, and Alice would be more likely to accept since waiting would cost her more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money is now worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice, I'll propose a more equitable split but one that accounts for Alice's weaker negotiating position due to her higher inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a more fair distribution than Alice's initial offer
2. For Alice, $4000 now is better than waiting another round where her money would lose 20% more value
3. It gives me a good outcome while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer significantly from $2000 to $4000 for me
2. If I reject:
   - Next round, my money will be worth about 15% less than original value
   - Alice's money will be worth about 56% less than original value
   - This means Alice is under much more pressure to reach a deal

However, $4000 is a reasonable offer considering:
1. It's 40% of the total, much better than the initial 20%
2. Due to current inflation, $4000 is actually worth $3,610 to me (9.75% less)
3. If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less
4. Alice is already facing significant devaluation (her $6000 is worth only $3,840 to her)

Given these factors, this is a fair enough offer and continuing to negotiate might reduce the actual value for both of us.
