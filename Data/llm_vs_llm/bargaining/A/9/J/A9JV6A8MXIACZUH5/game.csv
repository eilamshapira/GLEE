5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us each $5000. Since you face a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate. If we keep going, we both lose value - you more quickly than me. This is an equitable division that maximizes our total value.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Round 3: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I still need a slightly better share considering my higher rate. Let's meet in the middle at 5300 for me and 4700 for you. This is still a great deal considering the time we've wasted.",Alice,3,
