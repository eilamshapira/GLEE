"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us each $5000. Since you face a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate. If we keep going, we both lose value - you more quickly than me. This is an equitable division that maximizes our total value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
