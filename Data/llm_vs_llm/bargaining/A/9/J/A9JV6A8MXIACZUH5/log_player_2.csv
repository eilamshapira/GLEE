"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 1: Let's split it fairly - I get 5500, you get 4500. This is a generous offer to start, knowing inflation will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is fair given the inflation rates.

Since inflation reduces the value by 5% for me (Bob) and 10% for Alice in each round, rejecting and waiting could lead to a better offer for me. If I reject, I'll make the next offer with slightly less total value for both of us.

The current offer gives me $4,500, which is less than half. I think I can propose a better division for myself in the next round, and Alice will likely accept due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us each $5000. Since you face a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate. If we keep going, we both lose value - you more quickly than me. This is an equitable division that maximizes our total value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 3: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I still need a slightly better share considering my higher rate. Let's meet in the middle at 5300 for me and 4700 for you. This is still a great deal considering the time we've wasted. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering our inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $4,700 now. If I reject, we go to round 4, where my offer would be subject to 14.26% inflation for me and 27.1% inflation for Alice compared to round 1.

Since we've already lost value due to inflation (9.75% for me, 19% for Alice), and Alice's inflation rate is higher than mine, I should consider accepting this offer. The amount I'm getting ($4,700) is better than my initial rejection of $4,500, and further negotiations will continue to erode value for both of us.

Given that Alice compromised from her initial position and the accelerating impact of inflation, this seems like a reasonable deal.
