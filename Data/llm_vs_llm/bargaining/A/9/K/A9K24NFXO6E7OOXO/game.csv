450000.0,550000.0,"Given the risk of inflation, I propose we take a more balanced approach this round. I'll take $550000, leaving you with $450000. This way, we both secure a good amount before the value decreases further.",Bob,2,

530000.0,470000.0,"Let's be practical here. I'm offering you a better deal than your last proposal, and we're both losing money with each round due to inflation. This is a fair split that benefits us both - let's end this now.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the ongoing inflation, I suggest we settle for a near-even split. I propose $520000 for me and $480000 for you. This way, we minimize our losses and end the game sooner rather than later.",Bob,4,
