"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates for both of us, I think a 52-48 split in my favor is more fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share while accounting for the value loss over time. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4,800, but it's worth 10% less, so effectively $4,320
   * Bob gets $5,200, worth 5% less, so effectively $4,940

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * The total value will depreciate further (20% for me, 10% for Bob)
   * The negotiation might drag on, causing both of us to lose more value
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given that the depreciation rate is higher for me than for Bob, and that further delays will significantly reduce the real value of any future agreement, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further value loss.
