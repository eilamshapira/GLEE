"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a reasonable split, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 20% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while ensuring I get a good deal in the first round, before inflation affects the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
* I would get $500,000, but it's worth only $400,000 to me due to inflation
* Bob would get $500,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
* The money will be worth another 20% less for me (so 40% less total)
* I could propose a higher split in my favor, but Bob might reject again
* My bargaining power is decreasing with each round due to inflation

Given that Bob's offer gives me an effective $400,000 and further delays would reduce my value even more, I should accept this offer.
