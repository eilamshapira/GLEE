"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement, and I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. Let's avoid dragging this out and losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate moving towards a more balanced split. However, with the 20% cumulative inflation impact on my side so far, I need a bit more. I'm proposing 55-45 in my favor this time. This is fair and helps us both avoid further value loss from inflation.

# Alice gain: 5500
