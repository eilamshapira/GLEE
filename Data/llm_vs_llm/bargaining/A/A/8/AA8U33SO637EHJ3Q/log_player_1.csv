"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer as Alice in this negotiation game. I need to consider the inflation effect, which reduces the money's value by 5% for me each round.

My proposal for dividing the $1,000,000:

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging that I should secure a good deal in the first round due to the inflation penalty I face in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm receiving slightly less than I proposed initially, the 5% inflation penalty means further negotiation would reduce the value of my potential gain. With Bob facing a 10% inflation penalty, this offer represents a reasonable compromise, and I'll secure $450,000 without risking further depreciation of the money's value."
