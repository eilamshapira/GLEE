450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's avoid further losses from inflation. I’m offering a fair—but proposer‐favored—split: I take 550K and you get 450K. This way, we lock in value now rather than see the pot shrink further. I hope you'll agree that this is a smart, mutually beneficial deal.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your previous offer, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering a split where I take 550K and you get 450K. This way, we both get a fair share before the value decreases further.",Alice,3,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, we both know that every additional round erodes the pot's value. I'm offering you 520K and keeping 480K for myself—a slight shift from our previous expectations but a deal that ensures we minimize further losses. Accepting now means we both secure more real value than waiting any longer.",Bob,4,
