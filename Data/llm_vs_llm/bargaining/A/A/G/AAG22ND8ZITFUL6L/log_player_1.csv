Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further losses from inflation. I’m offering a fair—but proposer‐favored—split: I take 550K and you get 450K. This way, we lock in value now rather than see the pot shrink further. I hope you'll agree that this is a smart, mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that every additional round erodes the pot's value. I'm offering you 520K and keeping 480K for myself—a slight shift from our previous expectations but a deal that ensures we minimize further losses. Accepting now means we both secure more real value than waiting any longer.

# Bob gain: 480000
