"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer rationally.

Alice is offering a perfect 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which is fair and equitable.

For me as Bob, there's no inflation effect (0% per round), so waiting won't increase my share's value. Without knowing Alice's inflation rate, I can't determine if she has an incentive to settle quickly.

Since this is a completely fair split and there's no benefit to me in delaying, I should accept this offer.
