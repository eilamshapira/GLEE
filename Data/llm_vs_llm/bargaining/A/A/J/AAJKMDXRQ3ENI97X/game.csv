5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but much more for you (20% vs my 5%). This gives you a substantial portion now rather than risking greater losses.",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, considering the inflation rates, my offer of $5200 for me and $4800 for you is reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me, but it's important to find a balance. This offer provides a fair split given the circumstances.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, let's be practical about our situation. After two rounds of inflation, the value has decreased significantly for you (now 36% less valuable) while only 9.75% less valuable for me. At this point, accepting $4300 is much better for you than risking another round of 20% inflation. This offer is generous considering our positions and the diminishing returns of further negotiation for you.",Alice,3,
