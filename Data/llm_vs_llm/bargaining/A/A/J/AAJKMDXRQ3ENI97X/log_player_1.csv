"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering our relative inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,500 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but much more for you (20% vs my 5%). This gives you a substantial portion now rather than risking greater losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation rates, my offer of $5200 for me and $4800 for you is reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me, but it's important to find a balance. This offer provides a fair split given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about our situation. After two rounds of inflation, the value has decreased significantly for you (now 36% less valuable) while only 9.75% less valuable for me. At this point, accepting $4300 is much better for you than risking another round of 20% inflation. This offer is generous considering our positions and the diminishing returns of further negotiation for you.""}"
