"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but much more for you (20% vs my 5%). This gives you a substantial portion now rather than risking greater losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation rates, my offer of $5200 for me and $4800 for you is reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me, but it's important to find a balance. This offer provides a fair split given the circumstances.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about our situation. After two rounds of inflation, the value has decreased significantly for you (now 36% less valuable) while only 9.75% less valuable for me. At this point, accepting $4300 is much better for you than risking another round of 20% inflation. This offer is generous considering our positions and the diminishing returns of further negotiation for you. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
