"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make this quick and fair. I'm offering you a substantial $400,000, which is a very reasonable split considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I'm taking a bigger risk by going to the next round, so I deserve a bigger share. This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000 worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value
* If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  - The money will be worth another 5% less for me
  - I'd need to offer Bob enough to make him accept
  - The risk of further devaluation is significant
  - Bob's position is weaker due to his 20% inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the risk of further devaluation and potential continued rejection makes accepting this offer the more prudent choice.
