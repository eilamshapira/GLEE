"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me a slight majority of the money, I'm inclined to accept it. However, I should also consider the potential consequences of rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.

Given that the money will be worth 20% less in the next round, I think it's a good idea to accept the offer and get the majority of the money now.
