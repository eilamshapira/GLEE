55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me since I'm affected by inflation (5% per round). This way we both get a fair value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation.",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since I'm not affected by it, I'm proposing a split that's still favorable for you to accept now rather than later. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation per round. This deal gives you $48 now, which is worth more than getting $50 two rounds from now.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I appreciate your reasoning, but let's be fair. With 5% inflation affecting only me, I need a slightly better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face. If we keep going, we both risk losing value - you from reduced total and me from inflation.",Alice,3,
