"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me since I'm affected by inflation (5% per round). This way we both get a fair value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since I'm not affected by it, I'm proposing a split that's still favorable for you to accept now rather than later. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation per round. This deal gives you $48 now, which is worth more than getting $50 two rounds from now. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your reasoning, but let's be fair. With 5% inflation affecting only me, I need a slightly better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face. If we keep going, we both risk losing value - you from reduced total and me from inflation.""}"
