"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher share for me since I'm affected by inflation (5% per round). This way we both get a fair value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer gives me $45 and her $55
2. She's right about inflation affecting her more (5% per round for her, 0% for me)
3. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
4. For Alice, her $55 will be worth ~$52.25 next round due to 5% inflation
5. This means I could potentially offer a better deal for both of us next round

While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I have a stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while maintaining a better position for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since I'm not affected by it, I'm proposing a split that's still favorable for you to accept now rather than later. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less due to the 5% inflation per round. This deal gives you $48 now, which is worth more than getting $50 two rounds from now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your reasoning, but let's be fair. With 5% inflation affecting only me, I need a slightly better deal to offset this disadvantage. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face. If we keep going, we both risk losing value - you from reduced total and me from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $48 and taking $52
2. Her previous offer was $45 for me, so this is better
3. Due to inflation affecting her, her $52 is actually worth about $47 to her now
4. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, and:
   - Her inflation will increase to about 15%
   - We'll be using up more rounds (only 12 total)
   - Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree
5. This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
   - It's better than her first offer
   - The inflation is already eating into her share
   - We're avoiding the risk of further rounds

Given these factors, this seems like a fair compromise. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns for both of us.
