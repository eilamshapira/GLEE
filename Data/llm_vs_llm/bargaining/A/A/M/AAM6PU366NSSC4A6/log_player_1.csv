"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share. It's better to end the game sooner to avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
