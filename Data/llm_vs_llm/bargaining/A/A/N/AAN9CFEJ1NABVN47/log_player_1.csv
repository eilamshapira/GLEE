"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $10,000 in this first round.

Given that we both face inflation but at different rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a fair division that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and allows us both to maximize our gains without risking further devaluation through additional rounds."
