"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split of the money, which is generally considered equitable. However, since I'm first to respond, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. 

But I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 5% less next round (so the total pot would be worth $9,500)
2. Alice could then reject my offer, leading to even more losses
3. A 50-50 split is a standard fair division that's hard to argue against

Given these factors, it's probably best to accept this fair offer now rather than risk losing value through negotiation.
