900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I get 90% and you get 10%. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Let's make it more balanced. I'll take 70%, and you'll get 30%. Fairer than last round, considering the inflation effects.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I understand the inflation, but 30% is still too low for me.  Let's split it 60/40. This is a fair compromise considering our losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering current inflation, let's find middle ground. How about 55% for me and 45% for you? It's a closer split and could be beneficial for both.",Bob,4,
