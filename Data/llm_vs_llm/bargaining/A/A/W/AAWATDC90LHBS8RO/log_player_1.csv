Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 526316, ""bob_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 now as $526,316 for me and $473,684 for you. If we delay to the next round, the total amount shrinks by 10%, so itâ€™s in both of our interests to settle now on this fair division. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the previous round, Alice.  However, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's settle this now and avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 473684 
# Bob gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
