Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 now as $526316 for me and $473684 for you. If we delay to the next round, the total amount shrinks by 10%, so itâ€™s in both of our interests to settle now on this fair division. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316
