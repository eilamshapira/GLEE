"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it gives both of us a substantial amount. If we delay, both of us will lose value due to inflation, especially me with a 20% loss per round compared to Bob's 5%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. Not only would I get less than Bob ($400,000 vs $600,000), but due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing, this money would be worth even less to me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split considering the inflation penalties we both face."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that my inflation penalty (20%) is four times higher than Bob's (5%), I need a larger share to compensate for the rapid devaluation of my portion. This offer is fair considering the asymmetric inflation rates, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, we're already in round 4 and my inflation penalty is becoming severe (48.8% loss). If we continue negotiating, my potential gains will decrease dramatically due to the 20% per-round inflation on my side. With this deal, I'll get $450,000 (though worth significantly less due to inflation), but it's better than risking further rounds where my share would be worth even less. The mounting inflation pressure makes this a reasonable compromise at this point."
