"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4500 I'd gain is actually worth $3600 to me (20% less than the original value). 

My decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me in each round. In Round 1, it was worth 100%, in Round 2, it was worth 80%, and now in Round 3, it's worth 64% of the original value (80% * 0.8 = 0.64).

To calculate the offer, I'll consider the reduced value:

My offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, a bit more for you, but still reasonable for me""
}
```"
