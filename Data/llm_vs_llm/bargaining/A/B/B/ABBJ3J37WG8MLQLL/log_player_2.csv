Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after the first round, the total amount we're negotiating over is now:
$1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000 for me
$1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000 for Alice

I'll make a proposal to divide the original $1,000,000, keeping in mind the reduced value.
