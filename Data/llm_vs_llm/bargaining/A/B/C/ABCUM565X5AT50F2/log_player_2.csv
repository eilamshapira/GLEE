"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm being a little more generous this time. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. It's better to negotiate further and aim for a more equitable split, even with inflation."

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.  We're both losing money with each round!""}
