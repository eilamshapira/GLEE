"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer in this negotiation game. Since we're dividing $10,000, and I need to be aware that money loses 20% of its value for me (but not for Bob) with each passing round, I should propose a fair division that takes this inflation penalty into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly larger share for myself ($5,500) with $4,500 going to Bob. This is a fair initial offer that acknowledges we both deserve a substantial portion, while giving me a small buffer against the potential inflation penalty I face if we move to future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob rejected my initial offer and proposed a division that heavily favors him. Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider that any money I receive is worth 40% less to me than in round 1 due to inflation (20% per round). I'll make a more strategic counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. Given the inflation penalty I face, this division helps compensate for the decreasing value of money to me over time. It's a fair proposal that takes into account the asymmetric inflation disadvantage I have in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob has rejected my offers and is gradually trying to take a larger share while offering me less each time. Given that we're now in round 5, the money I receive is worth approximately 60% less than in round 1 due to compounding inflation (20% per round). I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. This higher amount for me helps offset the significant inflation penalty I'm facing. Since Bob doesn't face any inflation penalty, he would receive the full value of his $3,000. This offer reflects the economic reality of our different positions in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
