50.0,50.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy to reach an agreement right away, but I'm also open to counter-offers.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your fair initial offer. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split of 55-45 in my favor to account for this disadvantage. This is still quite balanced and acknowledges the time pressure affects me more than you.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you, but inflation doesn't make the actual pie smaller - we're still dividing $100. A 50-50 split remains objectively fair. If we continue going back and forth, you'll lose more to inflation than what you're trying to gain with uneven splits. This equal division is my final offer.",Alice,3,
