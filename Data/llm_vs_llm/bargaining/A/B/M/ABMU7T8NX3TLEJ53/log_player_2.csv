"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy to reach an agreement right away, but I'm also open to counter-offers. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice claims inflation doesn't affect her, which means time works against me more than her. A 50-50 split right now would give me $50, and if I reject and try for more next round, the total amount would already be worth 5% less to me.

Given that:
1. This is a fair starting offer
2. Inflation reduces the value of money only for me
3. We have limited rounds and risk getting nothing if we can't agree
4. I can make a counter-offer next round if I reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your fair initial offer. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split of 55-45 in my favor to account for this disadvantage. This is still quite balanced and acknowledges the time pressure affects me more than you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you, but inflation doesn't make the actual pie smaller - we're still dividing $100. A 50-50 split remains objectively fair. If we continue going back and forth, you'll lose more to inflation than what you're trying to gain with uneven splits. This equal division is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this situation. Alice is offering a 50-50 split again, but now due to inflation, $50 is worth about $45.13 to me (after 9.75% inflation). If I reject and we continue negotiating, the value will decrease further for me.

Alice appears firm in her position, stating this is her ""final offer."" If I reject, I might end up with even less value due to continued inflation, and we risk reaching round 12 with no agreement.

Since inflation only affects me and not Alice, continuing to negotiate puts me at a disadvantage. The longer we take, the less value I receive, regardless of the nominal amount.
