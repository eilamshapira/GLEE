"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous! Take this deal and let's split this cash! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and 10% less for Alice, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

For Round 2, the total value of the money for me is 1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000, and for Alice, it's 1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, shall we?""}"
