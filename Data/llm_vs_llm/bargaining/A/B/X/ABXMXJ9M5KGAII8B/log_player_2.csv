"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be reduced by 10% to $900,000. That means even if I propose a 50-50 split next round, I would get $450,000 and Alice would get $450,000 (assuming she accepts).

Since $450,000 is better than the $400,000 I'm being offered now, and I believe I can make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the declining value of the total sum.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both receive equal shares of $500,000 each, which is better for me than the previous offer and still very good for Alice. A fair division avoids further rounds where inflation will reduce our total amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. This is an improvement from her first offer where she proposed I get $400,000.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will be worth 27.1% less than the first round (compounding 10% each round). If I propose a 50-50 split in round 4, each of us would get approximately $500,000 Ã— (1-0.271) = $364,500 in equivalent round 1 value.

Since Alice's current offer of $450,000 is better than what I could reasonably expect in the next round after further inflation, I'll accept this offer.
