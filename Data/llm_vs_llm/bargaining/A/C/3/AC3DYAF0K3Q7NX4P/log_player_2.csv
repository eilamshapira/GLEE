"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair starting point, let's avoid losing money to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me a 40% share ($400,000) while taking 60% ($600,000) for herself. 

While this isn't an even split, I need to be mindful of the 20% inflation penalty per round. If I reject and propose next round, the total value will only be $800,000. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split then, I'd get $400,000 - the same as Alice's current offer.

Considering the inflation mechanic and the fact that we only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation.
