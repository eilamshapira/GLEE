450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate agreement to avoid future losses from inflation. In my offer, you receive $550000 and I receive $450000. I believe this split is fair given that delaying further will cost us both—especially me with a steeper devaluation. Let’s settle now and secure our shares before the value drops any further.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe your initial offer doesn't account for my negotiating position. Given that I can afford to wait a bit longer and your losses to inflation are steeper, I'm making a counteroffer. I'll take $600000, and you'll get $400000. This way, we both still benefit, but the split is more reflective of our respective risks.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your negotiating position. Given the steep devaluation I'll face with further rounds, I believe it's best for me to accept your proposal of $400000 for me (and $600000 for you) at this stage. Looking forward to finalizing this agreement.",Alice,2,accept
