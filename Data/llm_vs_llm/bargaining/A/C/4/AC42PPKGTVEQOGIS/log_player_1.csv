"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate agreement to avoid future losses from inflation. In my offer, you receive $550,000 and I receive $450,000. I believe this split is fair given that delaying further will cost us both—especially me with a steeper devaluation. Let’s settle now and secure our shares before the value drops any further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe your initial offer doesn't account for my negotiating position. Given that I can afford to wait a bit longer and your losses to inflation are steeper, I'm making a counteroffer. I'll take $600000, and you'll get $400000. This way, we both still benefit, but the split is more reflective of our respective risks. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your negotiating position. Given the steep devaluation I'll face with further rounds, I believe it's best for me to accept your proposal of $400,000 for me (and $600,000 for you) at this stage. Looking forward to finalizing this agreement.""}"
