"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate agreement to avoid future losses from inflation. In my offer, you receive $550000 and I receive $450000. I believe this split is fair given that delaying further will cost us both—especially me with a steeper devaluation. Let’s settle now and secure our shares before the value drops any further. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe your initial offer doesn't account for my negotiating position. Given that I can afford to wait a bit longer and your losses to inflation are steeper, I'm making a counteroffer. I'll take $600,000, and you'll get $400,000. This way, we both still benefit, but the split is more reflective of our respective risks.""}"
