"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! How about we split it evenly? This way, we both benefit equally and can quickly reach an agreement. Fair and square! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation for me, if I accept this 50-50 split now:
* My $50 is actually worth $45 (50 * 0.9)
* If I reject, I can make another offer, but my next gain will be worth even less

Bob's loss to inflation is higher than mine (20% vs 10%), so he might be more eager to reach an agreement soon.

However, a 50-50 split is quite fair, and with inflation eating into future rounds, delaying might make things worse for both of us.
