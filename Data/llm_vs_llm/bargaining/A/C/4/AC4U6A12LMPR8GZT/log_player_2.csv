"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60 out of the $100. 

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total money will be worth 20% less (meaning only $80 total value). I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but Alice might reject that too, causing further inflation.

This isn't a perfectly equal split, but it's not terrible either. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with much less due to the ""inflation"" penalty.
