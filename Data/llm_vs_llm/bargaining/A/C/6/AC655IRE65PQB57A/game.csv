520000.0,480000.0,"Alright, Bob, I see where you're coming from. How about we meet closer to your preference but still fair to both of us? I'll take $520000 and you get $480000. This way, we both come out ahead before inflation hits harder. Deal?",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's make it perfectly fair now. How about we split it right down the middle at $500000 each? This ensures that we both get a decent amount without further loss from inflation.",Alice,5,
