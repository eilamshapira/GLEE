"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this quick and efficient. I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. This way, we maximize value before inflation reduces the total. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I understand you want a larger share, but we both lose if this drags on. How about a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I see where you're coming from. How about we meet closer to your preference but still fair to both of us? I'll take $520000 and you get $480000. This way, we both come out ahead before inflation hits harder. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's better, waiting too long will hurt Alice more than me. I need to push for a better split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and frankly, you're losing more than me with every wasted round.  I'm offering a 58/42 split. Let's be sensible and close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's make it perfectly fair now. How about we split it right down the middle at $500000 each? This ensures that we both get a decent amount without further loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.  A 50/50 split ensures I don't lose out too much to inflation."
