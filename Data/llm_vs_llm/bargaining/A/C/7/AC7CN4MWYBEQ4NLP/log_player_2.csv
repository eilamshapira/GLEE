"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing an equal 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000.

This is a fair offer that gives me half of the total amount. Since there's no inflation for me, the value remains the same in future rounds. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me more leverage in later rounds.

On the other hand, if we fail to reach an agreement within 12 rounds, we both get nothing. Given this is a perfectly fair first offer, and there's risk in rejection, I'll accept.
