Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me is now 1,000,000 * 0.9 = 900,000
The value of the money for Alice is now 1,000,000 * 0.8 = 800,000

I'll make a proposal that is slightly in my favor, but still reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money for me is 1,000,000 * 0.81 (10% less in round 1 and 9% less in round 2, so 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) and for Alice is 1,000,000 * 0.64 (20% less in round 1 and 16% less in round 2, so 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

Given that Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable considering the decreased value of the money, I will accept this offer.
