I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This seems fair since I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous proposal.  I'm offering 650,000 for myself and 350,000 for Bob. This feels like a more balanced split considering the changing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
