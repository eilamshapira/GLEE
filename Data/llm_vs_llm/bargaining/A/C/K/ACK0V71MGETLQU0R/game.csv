6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000 and you get $4000. It's a good initial split considering future inflations.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Given that money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), this 55/45 split is actually fair. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Let's aim for a closer middle ground. I propose $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This way, we both face less devaluation and it's fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
