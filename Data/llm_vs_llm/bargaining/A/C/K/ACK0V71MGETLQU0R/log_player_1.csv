"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. It's a good initial split considering future inflations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), this 55/45 split is actually fair. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
