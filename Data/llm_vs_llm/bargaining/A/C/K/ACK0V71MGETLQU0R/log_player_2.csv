"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000 and you get $4000. It's a good initial split considering future inflations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice
   * This means the total effective value will be lower for both of us
   * However, I'll have negotiating power

Since this is the first round and the offer gives Alice a significantly larger share (60/40 split), I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given that money devalues faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), this 55/45 split is actually fair. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to both of us.""}

Reasoning:
1. The money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice
2. A 55/45 split is more equitable than the initial 40/60 split
3. My message emphasizes the time pressure due to different inflation rates
4. If Alice rejects, the next round will see even more value destruction"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's aim for a closer middle ground. I propose $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This way, we both face less devaluation and it's fair. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: I get $4800, Alice gets $5200 (52/48 split)
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $4800 is worth only $3888 (19% less)
   * Alice's $5200 is worth only $3328 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth even less (29% less for me, 48% less for Alice)
   * My negotiating power diminishes as total value erodes

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's closer to a 50/50 split than previous offers
- Further negotiations will significantly reduce value for both of us
- The absolute value loss is already substantial
