"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me only $100,000 (10%) while she takes $900,000 (90%). Considering that my money loses 20% value each round, if I reject now, I'll need to make an offer that accounts for this devaluation. However, this initial offer is quite unfair to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the 20% devaluation while still being reasonable to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $500,000 each. This is fair for both of us, and considering the 20% devaluation factor that affects me, it's reasonable to accept a fair division now rather than continue negotiating with diminishing returns."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from $100,000 to $300,000 for me. However, I need to consider the inflation factor carefully.

Due to 36% inflation from round 1, my $300,000 is effectively worth $192,000 of original value ($300,000 × 0.64). If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face 48.8% total inflation (0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8), which will further reduce the value of any money I receive.

While this offer still favors Alice considerably, the diminishing returns from inflation make it increasingly risky for me to continue negotiating.
