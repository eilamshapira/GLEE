6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us with the inflation effect.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a reasonable amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, due to the 10% inflation effect on my gains, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair value. With this 65-35 split, I'll actually receive 5850 in real value (90% of 6500), while you get 3500. This is closer to a fair split considering the inflation impact on my side.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my gains are not affected by inflation. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, with the inflation now at 27.1%, I need a 70-30 split for us to reach a fair outcome. My 7000 is actually worth only 5103 in real value (72.9% of 7000), while you get your 3000 at full value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will continue to hurt both our potential gains.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting your gains more with each round. However, my gains remain constant. Let's settle for a 60-40 split to accommodate the inflation impact on your side while also considering my position.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With 40.95% inflation on my side, my 7500 is only worth 4429 in real value (59.05% of 7500), while you get your 2500 at full value. We're more than halfway through our rounds, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both walk away with nothing. This split gives us both a reasonable outcome considering the inflation effect.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we're running out of rounds, and I understand that inflation is significantly affecting your gains. However, my gains remain unaffected. Let's settle for a 65-35 split to ensure we both walk away with something, considering the increasing risk of getting nothing if the game continues.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, we have only 3 rounds left after this. With 52.17% inflation, my 8000 would be worth only 3826 in real value (47.83% of 8000), while you get your 2000 at full value. This makes the real value split much closer to 65-35. Please consider accepting - the alternative might be both of us getting nothing if we run out of rounds.",Alice,9,
