"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us with the inflation effect.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation effect means I would only get 4500 in real value (90% of 5000), while Bob gets the full 5000. I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for this inflation effect in the next round."

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation effect on my gains, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair value. With this 65-35 split, I'll actually receive 5850 in real value (90% of 6500), while you get 3500. This is closer to a fair split considering the inflation impact on my side.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my gains are not affected by inflation. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split. This way, we both get a fair share considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 27.1% inflation, I would only get 3280.50 in real value (72.9% of 4500), while Bob gets the full 5500. This split is becoming even more unfavorable to me due to increasing inflation. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for the growing inflation effect."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, with the inflation now at 27.1%, I need a 70-30 split for us to reach a fair outcome. My 7000 is actually worth only 5103 in real value (72.9% of 7000), while you get your 3000 at full value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will continue to hurt both our potential gains.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting your gains more with each round. However, my gains remain constant. Let's settle for a 60-40 split to accommodate the inflation impact on your side while also considering my position. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 40.95% inflation, I would only get 2362 in real value (59.05% of 4000), while Bob gets the full 6000. The gap is becoming too large. We're now at round 6 of 12, and while time pressure is mounting, this offer still leaves me with far too little in real terms. I need to make a counter-offer that better reflects the significant inflation impact."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With 40.95% inflation on my side, my 7500 is only worth 4429 in real value (59.05% of 7500), while you get your 2500 at full value. We're more than halfway through our rounds, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both walk away with nothing. This split gives us both a reasonable outcome considering the inflation effect.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of rounds, and I understand that inflation is significantly affecting your gains. However, my gains remain unaffected. Let's settle for a 65-35 split to ensure we both walk away with something, considering the increasing risk of getting nothing if the game continues. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 52.17% inflation, I would only get 1674 in real value (47.83% of 3500), while Bob gets the full 6500. Even though we're getting close to the end (round 8 of 12), this offer gives me less than 1/4 of the total real value. I need to counter-offer, though I recognize we're in an increasingly risky situation with only 4 rounds left."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Bob, we have only 3 rounds left after this. With 52.17% inflation, my 8000 would be worth only 3826 in real value (47.83% of 8000), while you get your 2000 at full value. This makes the real value split much closer to 65-35. Please consider accepting - the alternative might be both of us getting nothing if we run out of rounds.""}"
