"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of dividing the $10,000 with me getting $4,000 and Alice getting $6,000.

While the split isn't equal, it's not terribly unfair. However, since we have multiple rounds, I think I can propose a more equitable division. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equal division of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the amount, giving us both an equal share of $5,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is moving toward a more equitable split, offering me $4,500 now instead of the original $4,000. This is progress, but I think we can reach an even fairer distribution since we still have several rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make another offer that moves us closer to agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,800 and Alice receives $5,200. This is a compromise between my previous equal split and Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is gradually increasing her offers, now up to $4,700 for me. We're getting closer to agreement, but since we still have 7 more potential rounds, I'll try one more negotiation to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $4,750 and Alice receives $5,250. This is very close to Alice's last offer and shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer to $4,800 for me and $5,200 for herself, which is actually the same split I proposed in round 4. Since we're converging on an agreement and this is a reasonable offer, I'll accept it.
