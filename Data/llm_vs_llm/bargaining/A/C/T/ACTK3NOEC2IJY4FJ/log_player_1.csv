"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too aggressive to avoid immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split considering that if Bob rejects, his next potential gains will be worth 10% less to him. This offer gives him a decent portion while securing a favorable position for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4,500 (full value)
   * Bob gets $5,500 (at 90% value = $4,950 effective value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   * I have no inflation penalty
   * I still have many rounds left

Given that Bob's counter-offer is giving him more than half of the money, and I don't face any inflation penalty, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. I can make a new proposal next round where Bob's inflation penalty will make him more likely to accept a better split for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob is now facing a 20% depreciation on his portion (2 rounds of 10% each), I can adjust my offer accordingly. He should be more inclined to accept a smaller portion now since any future gains will be worth even less to him.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This offer gives Bob $3,500 which, at 80% value due to inflation, is worth $2,800 to him. If he rejects, his next potential gains will be worth even less due to another 10% depreciation. This makes accepting now more attractive for him while improving my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $5,800 (full value)
   * Bob gets $4,200 (at 72.9% value = $3,062 effective value for him)

2. This is actually a pretty good offer for me:
   * I get more than half of the total amount ($5,800)
   * It's better than my initial offer ($6,000/$4,000)
   * The split is favorable considering we're 4 rounds in
   * Bob is already experiencing significant inflation impact

Given that:
- This is a fair offer that favors me
- Further negotiations might lead to more hostile offers
- We still risk getting nothing if we reach round 12
- I get a clear majority of the money
