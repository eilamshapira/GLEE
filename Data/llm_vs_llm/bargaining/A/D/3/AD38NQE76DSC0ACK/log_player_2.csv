"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 evenly â€“ $5000 each. Because every extra round costs me 20% in value, it makes sense for both of us to settle now. I believe this fair division benefits both sides, and I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has offered a 50-50 split ($5000 each), I need to consider that the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round. This means if I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the total value will be reduced.

If I reject this round, I'll be making an offer on money that's worth 20% less to me. Even if I were to propose taking $6000 in the next round, that would only be worth $4800 to me due to inflation (80% of $6000).

Since Alice has offered me $5000 now, which is worth the full $5000 to me, this is better than any future offer I could make after inflation.
