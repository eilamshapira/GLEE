"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money considering the inflation.

In round 1, $1 for Alice was worth $1.

In round 2, the value of the money I receive is reduced by 20% due to inflation.  Therefore, $1 in round 2 is worth $0.80 of what it was worth in round 1.

So, if Bob offered me $55:

*   Actual value of Alice's gain = 55 * 0.80 = $44 (in round 1 dollar value)

Since I get $44 in round 1 value of dollars, I will accept the offer.
