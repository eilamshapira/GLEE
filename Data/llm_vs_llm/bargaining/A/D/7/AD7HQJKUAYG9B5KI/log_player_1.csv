Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it a bit more balanced, Alice. How about 4750 for me and 5250 for you? 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I'll accept your previous offer, Bob.  It seems only fair.""

This strategy takes advantage of Bob's discounting of the future. He's already shown a willingness to accept this split, and while waiting might seem beneficial in a vacuum, the time pressure is more significant for him."
