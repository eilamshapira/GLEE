"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after inflation)
5. We have 12 rounds, but waiting too long could leave us both with nothing

While 40-60 isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
