"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the risk of losing value to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose we split the money with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. This is a fairly balanced split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but is still very reasonable for Bob. If he rejects, we'll both lose money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $4,800 (worth $4,800 due to 10% inflation = $4,320)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - Money will be worth another 10% less
   - I can make a new offer
   - But we risk further devaluation

Given that:
- The current offer is fairly balanced (48/52 split)
- The real value I'm getting is already reduced
- Rejecting would mean even more value lost to inflation
- There's no guarantee I could get a better deal next round
