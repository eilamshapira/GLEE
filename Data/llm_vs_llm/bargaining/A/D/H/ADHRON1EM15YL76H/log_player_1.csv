# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 10% inflation reduction in round 2 and another 10% in this round, the total value reduction for me is 19% (10% + 10% - 1% due to compounding). However, to simplify and focus on making a competitive offer, I'll aim for a division that acknowledges the decreasing value for me but still tries to be fair and enticing for Bob.
