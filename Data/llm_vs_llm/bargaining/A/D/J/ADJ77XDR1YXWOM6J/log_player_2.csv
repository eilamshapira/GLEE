Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, this offer is still worse for me than Alice's initial offer.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000} 

This is my final offer. It's important to make a firm stand, but I've also considered that continued rejection hurts both of us due to inflation."
