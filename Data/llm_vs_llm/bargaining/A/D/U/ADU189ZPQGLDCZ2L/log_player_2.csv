"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice.

She's proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. This is a 45%-55% split.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed a much more favorable split next round, I need to account for this loss in value.

Given that I can guarantee $450,000 now versus risking further negotiations with decreasing value, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
