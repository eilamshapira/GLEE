"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'd like to propose a more equitable split that benefits both of us. I suggest I receive $60 and you receive $40. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm facing a 5% penalty for each round we delay. A fair compromise would help us both walk away satisfied rather than continuing negotiations and potentially losing value."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a more balanced split where you receive $45 and I receive $55. This acknowledges the time pressure I'm under due to the inflation penalty, which has already reduced my value by nearly 10%. This is a fair compromise that gives you a significant portion while allowing me to avoid further depreciation. Let's conclude this negotiation now so we can both benefit."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a completely equal 50-50 split. This is the fairest possible division, giving us both exactly half. Even with my inflation penalty, which has now reached over 18%, a 50-50 split represents the most equitable outcome. I hope you'll recognize this as a reasonable compromise so we can conclude this negotiation. Neither of us benefits from continuing to delay."
