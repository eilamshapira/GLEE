"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, for the proposal, I'll still use the original $10,000 amount.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50/50 split of the original amount, considering the decreasing value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $3500 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $2240.

For Alice, the value of the money she would gain is $6500 * 0.9025 (1 - 0.0975) = $5863.75.

Given the significant decrease in value for me and the fact that we still have several rounds left, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 36% less for me, and it will be worth even less in the next rounds. For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less.

I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $3000 * 0.4096 (1 - 0.5904) = $1228.80.

For Alice, the value of the money she would gain is $7000 * 0.8145 (1 - 0.1855) = $5715.

Given the large difference in value and the fact that I'm losing more value each round, I should consider accepting this offer to get something rather than risking further devaluation.
