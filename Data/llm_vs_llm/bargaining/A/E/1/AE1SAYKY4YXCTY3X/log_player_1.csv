"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to propose a fair division that recognizes both our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an even split of the money - $500,000 for each of us. This is the fairest way to divide the sum, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount without needing to continue negotiating through multiple rounds."
