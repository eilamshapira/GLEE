"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given the higher inflation impact on your side (20% vs my 5%), accepting now would be better than waiting for future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even with the 20% inflation on my side, this is a fair deal considering you only face 5% inflation. Accepting this offer ensures we both get an equal share now, rather than risking more losses in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $50 at 95% value = $47.50 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round:
  * Money will be worth 90% for me and 60% for Bob
  * I could propose a more favorable split, but Bob might reject again
  * Further delays reduce value for both of us
- $47.50 is a reasonable amount, and waiting would reduce both our gains
