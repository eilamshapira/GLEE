"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my $40 would effectively become worth $38 next round
5. There's also no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

While $40 isn't a perfectly equal split, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject, I'd need to get significantly more in the next round to offset the inflation loss, and Alice might not accept.
