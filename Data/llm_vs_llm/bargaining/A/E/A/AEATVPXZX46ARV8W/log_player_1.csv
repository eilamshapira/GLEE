"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that inflation affects me but not Bob. I should aim for a higher initial amount since any delays will reduce my purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is reasonable considering I'm affected by inflation in future rounds. This gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this 50-50 split because with 5% inflation, my $500,000 would only be worth $475,000 in purchasing power. Since Bob isn't affected by inflation, he would get the full value of his $500,000. I can still make a counter-offer in the next round, though I'll need to consider that my share will be worth another 5% less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, my share will be worth 10% less due to inflation. I need to adjust my offer accordingly to compensate for this loss in purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering a 65-35 split. With 10% inflation on my part, my $650,000 would effectively be worth $585,000 in purchasing power, while Bob's $350,000 maintains its full value. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while helping to offset my inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 14.26% inflation, my $400,000 would only be worth about $343,000 in purchasing power, while Bob gets the full $600,000. This is too unfavorable for me. Even though continuing means facing higher inflation in the next round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. We still have 8 rounds left, though I need to be careful about letting this drag on too long as inflation continues to eat into my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're in round 5, my share will be worth about 19.26% less due to compounding inflation. I need to adjust my offer to account for this significant loss in purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering a 70-30 split. With 19.26% inflation on my part, my $700,000 would effectively be worth about $565,000 in purchasing power, while Bob's $300,000 maintains its full value. This offer still gives Bob a meaningful share while helping to compensate for my significant inflation penalty. If we continue much longer, the inflation will make it increasingly difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 22.62% inflation, my $350,000 would only be worth about $271,000 in purchasing power, while Bob gets the full $650,000. This is very unfavorable for me. While rejecting means facing even higher inflation in the next round, there are still 6 rounds left to negotiate. However, I need to be mindful that my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation. I'll make a more moderate offer in the next round to try to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much of my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 7, and my share will be worth about 27.62% less due to compounding inflation. I need to balance between protecting my interests and making an offer that Bob is more likely to accept, as continuing much longer will severely impact my purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 675000, ""bob_gain"": 325000}

I'm offering a 67.5-32.5 split. With 27.62% inflation on my part, my $675,000 would effectively be worth about $488,500 in purchasing power, while Bob's $325,000 maintains its full value. This is a more moderate offer than my previous one, as I'm trying to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much more of my potential gains. I've reduced my ask compared to the last round to show willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 30.17% inflation, my $300,000 would only be worth about $209,500 in purchasing power, while Bob gets the full $700,000. This is extremely unfavorable. However, we're now entering a critical phase - with only 4 rounds left and rapidly increasing inflation, my negotiating position is weakening significantly. In the next round, I'll need to make a more attractive offer to Bob to try to reach an agreement before inflation makes any deal too unfavorable for me or we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're in round 9, with my share worth about 35.17% less due to compounding inflation. Given that we only have 3 rounds left after this and risk getting nothing if we don't agree, I need to make a more compelling offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split. With 35.17% inflation on my part, my $600,000 would effectively be worth about $389,000 in purchasing power, while Bob's $400,000 maintains its full value. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, giving Bob a larger share. We're reaching a critical point where failing to reach an agreement soon could result in both of us getting nothing, so I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise. The alternative of continuing to later rounds would leave me with even less purchasing power due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 36.98% inflation, my $250,000 would only be worth about $157,500 in purchasing power, while Bob gets the full $750,000. However, this is an extremely risky decision as we now only have 2 rounds left before we both get nothing. The next round will be my last chance to make an offer, and if that's rejected, we'll only have one final round to reach an agreement. I'll need to make a very attractive offer in the next round to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're in round 11 - this is critical as it's my last chance to make an offer. If Bob rejects this, we'll have only one more round before we both get nothing. With my share now worth about 41.98% less due to inflation, I need to make a very attractive offer to Bob to avoid the risk of mutual failure.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split. With 41.98% inflation on my part, my $500,000 would effectively be worth about $290,000 in purchasing power, while Bob's $500,000 maintains its full value. This is a significant concession from my previous offers, giving Bob an equal share. While this means I get less purchasing power, it's better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the final round. I hope Bob recognizes this as a fair compromise given we're one round away from both getting zero."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because it's the final round and our last chance to reach an agreement. With 43.12% inflation, my $200,000 would be worth about $113,760 in purchasing power, while Bob gets the full $800,000. While this is not a great deal for me, it's better than the alternative of rejecting it and having both of us get nothing. Since this is round 12, if I reject this offer, the game ends with zero payoff for both players. Therefore, accepting this offer is the rational choice despite the unfavorable terms."
