7378.0,2622.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $7378 and you get $2622. Given that any delay costs you 20% per round while my share stays undiminished, this offer gives you exactly what you'd expect to secure if you waited. I hope you agree to settle now!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's split this evenly. It's the fairest solution, and we both get a decent amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while an even split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation asymmetry works in my favor. My money isn't discounted over time, so by waiting for my proposal in round 3 I can secure a much better outcome for myself. Therefore, I must reject your offer.",Alice,2,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3: I’ll take $2000 and you get $8000. Remember that with each round you lose 20% of your money’s value, and by waiting until round 4 you would only secure an effective $8000×0.8 (i.e. about $5120) for yourself. This offer matches that continuation value exactly, so I believe it’s in both our best interests to agree now rather than risk further devaluation. What do you say?",Alice,3,
