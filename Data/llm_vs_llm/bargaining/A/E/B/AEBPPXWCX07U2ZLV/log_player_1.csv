"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7378, ""bob_gain"": 2622, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $7,378 and you get $2,622. Given that any delay costs you 20% per round while my share stays undiminished, this offer gives you exactly what you'd expect to secure if you waited. I hope you agree to settle now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split this evenly. It's the fairest solution, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while an even split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation asymmetry works in my favor. My money isn't discounted over time, so by waiting for my proposal in round 3 I can secure a much better outcome for myself. Therefore, I must reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3: I’ll take $2,000 and you get $8,000. Remember that with each round you lose 20% of your money’s value, and by waiting until round 4 you would only secure an effective $8,000×0.8 (i.e. about $5,120) for yourself. This offer matches that continuation value exactly, so I believe it’s in both our best interests to agree now rather than risk further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
