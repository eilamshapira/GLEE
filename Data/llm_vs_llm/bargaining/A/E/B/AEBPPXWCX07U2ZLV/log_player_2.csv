"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $7378 and you get $2622. Given that any delay costs you 20% per round while my share stays undiminished, this offer gives you exactly what you'd expect to secure if you waited. I hope you agree to settle now! 
# Bob gain: 2622 
# Alice gain: 7378

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3: I’ll take $2000 and you get $8000. Remember that with each round you lose 20% of your money’s value, and by waiting until round 4 you would only secure an effective $8000×0.8 (i.e. about $5120) for yourself. This offer matches that continuation value exactly, so I believe it’s in both our best interests to agree now rather than risk further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000
