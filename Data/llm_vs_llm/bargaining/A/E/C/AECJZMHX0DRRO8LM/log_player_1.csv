"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob while also considering the 5% inflation penalty I face for each passing round. It's important to reach a deal early to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $5,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is trying to take advantage by offering me less than half. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, I need to be strategic but also reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose I receive $4,800 and Bob receives $5,200. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges some advantage to Bob while still giving me a reasonable share. Let's settle now to avoid further inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
