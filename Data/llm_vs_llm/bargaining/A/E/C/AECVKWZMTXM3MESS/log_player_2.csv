"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take $5128 and you get $4872. I believe this fair split reflects our future bargaining positions and the 5% devaluation per round. Let's settle now before the pie shrinks further! 
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I receive $4872 while she gets $5128. This is slightly in her favor, with her getting about 51.3% of the total and me getting 48.7%.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less (only $9,500 total). However, in the next round, I would make the offer, which gives me some advantage.

Given that future rounds would lead to a smaller total amount to divide, and the current split is reasonably close to 50/50, I believe it's beneficial to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
