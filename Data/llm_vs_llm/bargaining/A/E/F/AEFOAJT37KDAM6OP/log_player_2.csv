"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This isn't an equal split, and I need to consider that if I reject and move to another round, my money will be worth 10% less due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total would effectively be worth $9,000 to me. Even if I managed to get a 50/50 split in the next round, I would receive $5,000 but it would only be worth $4,500 to me due to inflation. 

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially $4,500 in the next round (which isn't guaranteed as Alice might reject my offer), I'll accept this offer.
