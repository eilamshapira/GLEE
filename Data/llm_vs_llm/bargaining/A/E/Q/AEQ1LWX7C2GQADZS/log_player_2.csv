"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only 1% of the total amount. Even with 5% inflation per round, I can propose a much more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is a balanced and equitable division that should be acceptable to both parties. With inflation affecting future rounds, this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit equally."
