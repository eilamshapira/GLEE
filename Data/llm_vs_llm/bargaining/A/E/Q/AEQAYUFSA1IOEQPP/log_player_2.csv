"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's wrap this up quickly. I propose that you get $55 and I get $45. Accepting now avoids further delays (and my funds lose 20% value each round), so it's a win‚Äêwin for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $55, which is more than half of the total $100. She mentions her funds lose 20% value each round, but I know from the game rules that my money loses 10% value each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $55 would be worth $49.5 due to 10% inflation. So accepting now would be better than getting $50 or less in the next round.

Given that I'm getting more than half already and inflation will reduce my value in future rounds, this seems like a reasonable offer.
