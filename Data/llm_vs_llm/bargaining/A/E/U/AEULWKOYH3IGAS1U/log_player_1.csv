Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer for the first round, considering the 5% inflation effect per round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering inflation affects me by 5% each round. If we delay, we both lose value, so this is a good deal for both of us.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a slightly more balanced split is fair, especially since I rejected your last offer. This offer considers the inflation impact on me and aims for a mutually acceptable compromise. Let's secure this deal before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
