"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the $10,000 division.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation reducing the total value in future rounds."
