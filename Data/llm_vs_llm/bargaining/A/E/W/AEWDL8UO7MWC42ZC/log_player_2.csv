"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer from Alice.

While this offer gives me the maximum possible amount ($100), it's extremely unfair to Alice, offering her nothing. Even though she faces a 10% depreciation per round, completely excluding her from any gain isn't likely to lead to an agreement.

I should reject this and make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more balanced distribution that Alice might accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more reasonable offer. Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and she already showed an aggressive stance, I'll propose a split that gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that she might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This is much more reasonable than her initial offer, and given that she faces depreciation, she might prefer taking $30 now rather than risking further negotiations where her share would be worth less."
