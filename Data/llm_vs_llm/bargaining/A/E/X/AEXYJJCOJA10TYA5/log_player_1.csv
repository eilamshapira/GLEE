"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer considering that each round reduces the money's value by 10% for me, but not for Bob. I should account for this inflation when making my proposal.

""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 50-50 split, which seems fair to both of us. I'm aware that delays affect me more due to the 10% inflation on my side, so I hope we can agree quickly and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
