"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to take into account the 20% inflation penalty I face if I reject and move to the next round.

If I accept now, I get $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I receive next round will be worth 20% less to me. So to make rejection worthwhile, I would need to secure significantly more than $500,000 in the next round to offset this penalty.

Given the equal split seems fair and the inflation risk makes rejection potentially costly for me, I'll accept this offer.
