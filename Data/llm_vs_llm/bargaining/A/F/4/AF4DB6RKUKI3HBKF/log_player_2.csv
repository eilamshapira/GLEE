Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, the actual value of the offer for me is now:

450,000 * (1 - 0.19) = 364,500

And for Alice:

550,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = 496,125

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making my offer, I want to recalculate the actual value of the money for me and Alice, considering the inflation.

For me, the money is worth 28% less than at the beginning, and for Alice, it is worth 19.38% less.

Considering this, I will offer a 55%-45% split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

The actual value of this offer is:

For me: 550,000 * (1 - 0.28) = 396,000

For Alice: 450,000 * (1 - 0.1938) = 363,165"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","First, let's calculate the actual value of Alice's offer considering the inflation:

For me: 475,000 * (1 - 0.3439) = 311,787.75
For Alice: 525,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = 427,931.25

Given that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, it might be beneficial to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds.
