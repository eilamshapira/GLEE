9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9999 for myself. Accepting now means you receive your full $1 value, while waiting will cost you 20% per round. I believe this is a fair move given the discount your money faces with delay. Let’s settle it now!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split. This reflects that waiting longer hurts my position more than yours, but still gives you a very good deal. Consider carefully.",Bob,2,

3330.0,6670.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 your share is discounted to 60% of its face value. If you reject, you’ll become proposer in Round 4, but then the best you can do—even if you claimed nearly the entire $10000—is worth only around $4000 in real terms. By accepting my offer, you'll get $6670 nominal, which is effectively about $4002 in current value. I believe this split recognizes the inflation disadvantage you face and offers you a slightly better deal than waiting. Let's conclude this efficiently!",Alice,3,
