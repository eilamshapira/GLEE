"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9,999 for myself. Accepting now means you receive your full $1 value, while waiting will cost you 20% per round. I believe this is a fair move given the discount your money faces with delay. Let’s settle it now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split. This reflects that waiting longer hurts my position more than yours, but still gives you a very good deal. Consider carefully. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3330, ""bob_gain"": 6670, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 your share is discounted to 60% of its face value. If you reject, you’ll become proposer in Round 4, but then the best you can do—even if you claimed nearly the entire $10,000—is worth only around $4,000 in real terms. By accepting my offer, you'll get $6670 nominal, which is effectively about $4002 in current value. I believe this split recognizes the inflation disadvantage you face and offers you a slightly better deal than waiting. Let's conclude this efficiently!""}"
