"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9999 for myself. Accepting now means you receive your full $1 value, while waiting will cost you 20% per round. I believe this is a fair move given the discount your money faces with delay. Let’s settle it now! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is extremely unfair. While it's true my money loses value over time, waiting allows me to propose a counter offer. This gives me significant bargaining power.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not from a starting point of practically zero."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split. This reflects that waiting longer hurts my position more than yours, but still gives you a very good deal. Consider carefully.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 your share is discounted to 60% of its face value. If you reject, you’ll become proposer in Round 4, but then the best you can do—even if you claimed nearly the entire $10000—is worth only around $4000 in real terms. By accepting my offer, you'll get $6670 nominal, which is effectively about $4002 in current value. I believe this split recognizes the inflation disadvantage you face and offers you a slightly better deal than waiting. Let's conclude this efficiently! 
# Bob gain: 6670 
# Alice gain: 3330 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While her offer isn't perfectly equal in terms of the original dollar amounts, factoring in the inflation means accepting now gets me the best possible outcome. Waiting any longer would only further erode my potential gains."
