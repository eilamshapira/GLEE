"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But due to 20% inflation, if I reject, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject and propose 600k for me next round, even if accepted, it would be worth: 600k * 0.8 = 480k
5. Therefore, 500k now is better than a higher nominal amount next round
