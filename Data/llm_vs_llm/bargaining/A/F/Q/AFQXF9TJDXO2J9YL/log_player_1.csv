"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the higher inflation rate I face (20%) compared to Bob's (10%). Since both of us would lose value by prolonging the negotiation, I'll make a reasonable first offer that should be attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's better for both of us to reach an agreement early, and this division gives both parties a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 × 0.8 = $360,000 (effective value due to 20% inflation)
   * Bob gets $550,000 × 0.9 = $495,000 (effective value due to 10% inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation (40% for me, 30% for Bob)
   * I would need to offer a very attractive deal to overcome the inflation loss
   * Even if I propose a better split in the next round, the increased inflation would significantly reduce its value

Since waiting another round would mean substantial value loss for both parties, and $360,000 is still a significant amount, I'll accept this offer.
