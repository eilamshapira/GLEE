"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% vs my 5% per round), he has more incentive to agree early.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair starting point that gives both of us a substantial amount
2. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to 10% inflation
3. It's better than risking multiple rounds of negotiation where we both lose value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer gives me $4500, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $4275 to me
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, we'll face further inflation (5% for me, 10% for Bob)
3. We still have 10 rounds left, but prolonging could lead to significant value loss for both
4. While this is less than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable offer considering inflation effects

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation-adjusted amount is still significant
2. Further negotiation rounds will reduce the real value for both of us
3. There's risk in prolonging the negotiation
4. It's a reasonable compromise from Bob's initial counter-offer"
