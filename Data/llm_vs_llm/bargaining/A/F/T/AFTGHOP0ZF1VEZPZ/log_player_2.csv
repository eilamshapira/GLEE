"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. 

Alice is proposing I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice. So next round, the $1M would effectively be worth $950,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice.

If I make a fair counter-offer considering the depreciation, I could offer something better for me. But Alice might also reject, and we'd lose more value in subsequent rounds.

Given that Alice's money depreciates much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I have more leverage in later rounds. However, I also don't want to be too greedy and risk multiple rejections.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different rates of inflation and that should be appealing to Alice given her faster depreciation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division considering that if Alice rejects, the money will depreciate more for her (20%) than for me (5%) in the next round. This offer gives her a substantial portion while improving my position from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $480,000, which is better than her initial offer of $400,000. Due to inflation, this $480,000 is worth about 9.75% less than in round 1, so effectively worth around $433,200 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will depreciate further - by about 14.75% for me and 48.8% for Alice compared to round 1 values.

Alice has improved her offer substantially, recognizing the asymmetric inflation that affects her more severely. Given that she's moved significantly from her initial position and offered me a much better deal, and considering the continued depreciation if we keep negotiating:
