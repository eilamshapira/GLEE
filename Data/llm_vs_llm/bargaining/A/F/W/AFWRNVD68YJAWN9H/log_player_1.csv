"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as I have a better inflation rate (5% vs your 10%). If we delay too much, we both lose significantly. This split maximizes our combined value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe an equal split is fair given the circumstances. Although your inflation rate is better, starting with an even division seems reasonable. Let's not let the money lose too much value! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
