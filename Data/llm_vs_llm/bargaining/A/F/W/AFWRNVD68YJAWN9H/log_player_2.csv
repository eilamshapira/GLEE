"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as I have a better inflation rate (5% vs your 10%). If we delay too much, we both lose significantly. This split maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
