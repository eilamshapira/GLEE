"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for this division of $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split with a slight advantage to me since inflation will affect me more severely. With each round, my money loses 20% value while Bob's only loses 10% value, so it's reasonable that I get more in the first round. This is a generous offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while accounting for the difference in our inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer to Bob for this division of $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000}

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for the higher inflation rate I face. At this point, the money I receive has already lost 36% of its original value (20% compounded twice), while Bob's has only lost 19% (10% compounded twice). This offer gives Bob a bit more than my initial proposal while still ensuring I get enough to offset my steeper inflation penalty."
