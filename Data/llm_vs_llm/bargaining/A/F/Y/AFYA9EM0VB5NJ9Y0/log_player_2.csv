Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll explain my reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is going down for me each round. Waiting too long means I lose more.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice seems to be pushing for a slightly better deal each round, hoping I'll panic as the value decreases. 

I need to push for a more significant gain soon, or the inflation will eat away at any potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42} 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly for me. I need to apply pressure.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is a significant jump from my previous, signaling I'm serious about getting a larger share. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Not Too Greedy:**  While I want a larger share, being overly aggressive could backfire. This offer leaves a decent amount for Alice, increasing the chances of acceptance. 

Let's see what Alice says!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but the clock is ticking, and the value of the money is dropping fast for me. A 50/50 split is fair, and waiting any longer could result in getting even less."
