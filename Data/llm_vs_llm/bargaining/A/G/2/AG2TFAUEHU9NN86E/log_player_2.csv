"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Her money will be worth 5% less
3. The split isn't exactly equal (55/45)
4. However, rejecting means we both lose value due to inflation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. If I reject, my negotiating power in the next round is diminished due to the higher inflation rate affecting me. The difference between our shares ($1,000) is less than what we might lose through inflation and negotiation.
