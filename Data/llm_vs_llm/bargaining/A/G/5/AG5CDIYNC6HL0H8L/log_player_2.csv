"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or propose my own division in the next round. With a 5% inflation per round, my $4,000 will be worth less if I reject and wait to make a counter-offer.

Let me think about this carefully. If I reject, the $10,000 pot will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, but I could potentially negotiate a better split. However, the inflation risk compounds with each round.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and inflation affects me at 5% per round, I believe I can propose a more favorable split while still accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to consider. Since inflation affects me at 5% per round, I need to balance getting a better deal versus the decreasing value of waiting.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and balanced for both of us. This even division gives us both equal shares of the money and represents a fair compromise."
