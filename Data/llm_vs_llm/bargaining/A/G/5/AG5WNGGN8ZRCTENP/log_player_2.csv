"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Alice's Offer:** Bob gets $40, Alice gets $60.

*   **Current Value:** Since this is round 1, the money is still worth $100 for both of us.

*   **My Perspective (Bob):** I would get $40. If I reject, I risk getting less later due to inflation and the limited number of rounds.

*   **Alice's Perspective:** Alice gets $60. If she continues to the next round, it will be me making the decision.

Considering the immediate gain and the risk of diminishing returns in later rounds due to inflation, $40 is not a great deal, but it's something. I will reject this offer to try and negotiate for more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose. I need to balance getting a good share now with Alice potentially rejecting and the value of the money decreasing in future rounds. I will propose a more favorable split for myself, but still leave Alice with a reasonable amount to encourage acceptance.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer, taking into account the inflation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** Bob gets $45, Alice gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 36% less and hers is worth 19% less than in round 1. That is:
    *   Bob's money is worth 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 of its original value.
    *   Alice's money is worth 1 - 0.19 = 0.81 of its original value.

Let's determine the real value of the offer for both:

*   **Bob's perspective:** $45 * 0.64 = $28.8
*   **Alice's perspective:** $55 * 0.81 = $44.55

This offer is not very good for me because the real value for me is 28.8. Let's consider my alternatives. If I reject, I will have to create a proposal in the next round, in which my money will be worth even less. I don't think I can make any better proposal than this. Let's accept.
