"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer. I want to secure a decent amount early due to the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest taking $60 for myself and giving $40 to Bob. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is not favorable enough, especially considering the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing. Even though rejecting means facing another 20% reduction in the next round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that the money is now worth even less for me (40% less than round 1), I need to increase my share to compensate for the inflation, while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm proposing $65 for myself and $35 for Bob. This higher share helps offset my significant inflation penalty, while still leaving Bob with a meaningful amount. If we continue to reject offers, both of us risk getting nothing, so I hope this offer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's why:
1. With the 48.8% inflation penalty, my $45 is actually worth about $23.06
2. If I reject, the next round will have an even worse inflation penalty
3. We're already in round 4, and with only 12 rounds total, the risk of getting nothing is increasing
4. Bob has shown some movement from his previous offer (40/60 to 45/55)
5. Further negotiation might lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement

Better to secure this amount now than risk further depreciation or total loss."
