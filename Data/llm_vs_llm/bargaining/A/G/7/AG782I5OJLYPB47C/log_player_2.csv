"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. I think this is a fair start, considering I'm taking a bit more risk by making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically. She's offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself, justifying it with making the first move. This isn't a particularly fair split, and if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split that slightly favors me since Alice was initially aggressive with her offer.

{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I suggest a more balanced split of 55-45 in my favor. This is fairer than your initial proposal, and we both get a substantial share.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for an even split, 50-50. It's fair and equal, and I think it's time we end this back-and-forth. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair and reasonable offer. Alice has moved to an equal split, which is the most equitable solution. Given that continuing the negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or potentially worse offers, and that a 50-50 split is generally considered the most fair outcome, I'll accept this offer.
