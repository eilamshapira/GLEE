"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair but strategic first offer, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round if rejected.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I offer this division because:
1. It gives me a reasonable majority while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round, so I have incentive to make a compelling first offer
3. It's not so greedy that it would likely trigger spite or retaliation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept now:
   * I would get $450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000 in round 1 value
   * Bob would get $550,000

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   * The money will be worth another 20% less to me
   * I might get a higher nominal amount, but it would be worth even less
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer

3. Bob's offer is not terribly unfair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me

Given these considerations, I should accept this offer. The inflation penalty makes continuing the negotiation too risky for me.
