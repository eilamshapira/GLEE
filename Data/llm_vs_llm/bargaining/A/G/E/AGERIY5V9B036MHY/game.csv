650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This might seem unequal, but I face 20% inflation each round while you don't. If we go to round 2, the $1M is only worth $800K to me but still $1M to you. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree now for mutual benefit.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. While I understand your concerns about inflation, I believe a more even split is fairer. Let's work together to avoid the risk of losing money in further rounds.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I need to adjust my offer because of the increasing inflation pressure. Each round costs me significantly - the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1. If we go to round 4, I'll face 60% inflation while you face none. This 70/30 split accounts for this disadvantage and still gives you a substantial $300K. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish the total value for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I understand your situation, but I believe a 60/40 split is a fairer compromise given the increasing inflation affecting you.  It still gives you a significant portion of the money while also accounting for my lack of inflation. Let's avoid further rounds and secure a reasonable outcome for both of us.",Bob,4,
