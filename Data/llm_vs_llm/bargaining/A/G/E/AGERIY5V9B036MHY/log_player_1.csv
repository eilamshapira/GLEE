"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the 20% inflation I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This might seem unequal, but I face 20% inflation each round while you don't. If we go to round 2, the $1M is only worth $800K to me but still $1M to you. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree now for mutual benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. While I understand your concerns about inflation, I believe a more even split is fairer. Let's work together to avoid the risk of losing money in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, 
""bob_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to adjust my offer because of the increasing inflation pressure. Each round costs me significantly - the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1. If we go to round 4, I'll face 60% inflation while you face none. This 70/30 split accounts for this disadvantage and still gives you a substantial $300K. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish the total value for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but I believe a 60/40 split is a fairer compromise given the increasing inflation affecting you.  It still gives you a significant portion of the money while also accounting for my lack of inflation. Let's avoid further rounds and secure a reasonable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
