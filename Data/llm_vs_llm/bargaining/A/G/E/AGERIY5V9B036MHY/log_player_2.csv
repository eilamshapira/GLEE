"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This might seem unequal, but I face 20% inflation each round while you don't. If we go to round 2, the $1M is only worth $800K to me but still $1M to you. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree now for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to adjust my offer because of the increasing inflation pressure. Each round costs me significantly - the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1. If we go to round 4, I'll face 60% inflation while you face none. This 70/30 split accounts for this disadvantage and still gives you a substantial $300K. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish the total value for me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
