"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the total will be worth 10% less to me. Let me evaluate:

If I accept now: I get $500,000
If I reject and we reach agreement next round: The maximum I could get is $900,000 (if Alice accepts), but with 10% inflation, that's worth $810,000 to me.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in rejection since we don't know Alice's inflation rate, and she might reject my counteroffer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
