"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will only decrease by 5%.

If I reject this offer, in the next round the effective value of the total pot for me would be $80 (20% less). For Alice, it would be worth $95 (5% less).

While the offer isn't equal, rejecting might lead to a significant loss of value for me due to the asymmetric inflation rates. I'll accept this offer to secure $40 now rather than risk further devaluation.
