60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This is a generous offer, and remember the money loses value with each round due to inflation, so let's take it now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's be fair and split the money evenly. 50/50 ensures we both benefit and avoids further losses from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I propose 65 for me, 35 for you. It's more than your initial ask, and we secure something before it's all gone. Let's make a deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to be realistic. 55/45 acknowledges the time pressure while ensuring a more balanced outcome.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, time is running out, and inflation is hitting us hard. My offer is 70 for me and 30 for you. It might seem like a lot, but considering the diminishing value, it's a smart move to secure something substantial now. Don't let it all disappear!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing 60/40 - my original offer, only reversed. We are running out of time, and this ensures a decent share for both of us despite the inflation.",Bob,6,
