"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer. Given the inflation aspect that affects me (Alice) with each passing round, I need to offer a reasonable split that Bob will likely accept, while maximizing my gain.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if Bob rejects, inflation will reduce the value of my share in future rounds, which puts me at a disadvantage in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for a 60-40 split in his favor, which gives me less than what I originally offered him. Given that I still have negotiating power, it makes sense to make another proposal, even with the 10% inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic now, considering that my share has already lost 10% of its value and will lose another 10% if this round fails.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55-45 split. This is a more balanced proposal that recognizes the inflation pressure I'm under while still seeking a reasonable advantage. If Bob rejects again, my position will weaken further, so this represents a compromise from my initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the compounding inflation penalty (now at 27.1%), rejecting would put me in an increasingly weaker position. Bob has moved from his previous 60-40 split to a more reasonable 55-45 split in his favor. If I were to reject and propose again, I'd face even greater inflation, and Bob seems to be making strategic incremental concessions. This offer of $450,000 (worth about $328,000 after the inflation penalty) is better than risking another round of negotiations where my bargaining power would decrease further."
