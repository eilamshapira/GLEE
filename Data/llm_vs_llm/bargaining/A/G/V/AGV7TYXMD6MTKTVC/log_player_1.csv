"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000, keeping in mind the 5% inflation that affects me with each rejected round. I want to maximize my potential gain while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, especially since I don't know how inflation might be affecting him.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $450,000. This is a significant portion of the total and should be enticing. By claiming $550,000 for myself, I secure a slightly larger share but also ensure Bob receives a substantial amount. This first offer attempts to establish good faith and increase the likelihood of acceptance."
