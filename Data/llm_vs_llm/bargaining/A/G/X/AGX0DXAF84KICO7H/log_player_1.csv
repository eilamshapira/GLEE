Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $45 offered to me is actually worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each round, and we are now in the 3rd round, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

To maximize my gain, I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more.
