"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, considering potential future inflation if negotiations extend longer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45, which is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion. This offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it, saving us both from inflation losses in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me, especially since my inflation penalty (5%) is much lower than Bob's (20%). With this significant difference in inflation impacts, I have a stronger negotiating position in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I now know Bob has a much higher inflation penalty (20%) compared to my 5%, I can be a bit more assertive in my offer. However, I still want to make it attractive enough to avoid too many rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because Bob is losing value much faster than I am with each round, so they should be more motivated to accept a reasonable offer now rather than continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a reasonable split (45/55)
2. Bob's inflation penalty is much higher than mine (48.8% vs 14.26%)
3. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value
4. The offer is better than Bob's previous one (40/60)
5. With my 14.26% inflation penalty, I'll still get approximately $38.58 in round 1 value, which is acceptable"
