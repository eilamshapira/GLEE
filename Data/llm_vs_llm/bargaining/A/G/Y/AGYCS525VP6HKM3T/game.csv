250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, let's avoid further delays that might erode the value of the deal—especially given the unknown inflation effects that might hit you harder in later rounds. I propose a split where I receive $750000 and you receive $250000. Accept this offer now to secure your share before any devaluation occurs.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Meet in the middle, 55-45 split, before further devaluation",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, your proposal gives me $450000 while you’d effectively get about $496375 after accounting for inflation. I believe we can reach a more favorable split if we allow the negotiation to proceed another round. Let's continue.",Bob,3,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a favorable split—however, every round you delay further, your share suffers more from inflation. In this round, I’m offering you 570000 (which, even accounting for the 9.75% devaluation, nets you roughly 514425 in value) while I receive 430000 at full value. This is a genuine attempt to safeguard your earnings against further deterioration. Accept this offer now, so we both lock in our shares before the situation worsens.",Bob,4,
