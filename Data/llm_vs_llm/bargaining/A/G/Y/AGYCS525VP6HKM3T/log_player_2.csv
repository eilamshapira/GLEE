I propose a split where I receive $750,000 and you receive $250,000. Accept this offer now to secure your share before any devaluation occurs.""}"

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your proposal gives me $450,000 while you’d effectively get about $496,375 after accounting for inflation. I believe we can reach a more favorable split if we allow the negotiation to proceed another round. Let's continue.""}"

In this round, I’m offering you 570,000 (which, even accounting for the 9.75% devaluation, nets you roughly 514,425 in value) while I receive 430,000 at full value. This is a genuine attempt to safeguard your earnings against further deterioration. Accept this offer now, so we both lock in our shares before the situation worsens.""}"
