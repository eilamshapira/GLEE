600000.0,400000.0,"I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Consider that with each round, your money loses 10% value. If you accept now, you'll get the full $400000 worth.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to take a bit more, considering my money loses value each round. This is a fair offer, and we both get a good amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. At this point, your 420000 is worth more than what you'd get after more rounds of negotiation. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation factor.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the depreciation, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to Alice's previous one, but I still think I deserve a bit more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about the situation. At this point, your money has already lost over 27% of its value. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This 350000 now is worth more to you than a larger number in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I know my money is losing value, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering we're already halfway through the rounds.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, your money has lost nearly 41% of its value already. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This 300000 now is worth more than 500000 would be in the final rounds. Let's end this negotiation now - further delays only hurt your position.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"I know my position is weakening, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This offer is still relatively fair, considering the circumstances.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your money has lost over 52% of its value now. This 250000 is actually worth more to you than what you just offered me would be in the final rounds. We only have 3 rounds left after this - time is really working against you. This is a practical offer given the circumstances.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I know time is running out, but I'm trying to hold on to as much as I can. This offer is still somewhat reasonable, considering the rapidly decreasing value of my share.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round, and your money has lost over 61% of its value. If we go to the final round, your share will be worth even less. This 150000 now is worth more than 450000 would be in the final round. Take this offer, or we risk getting nothing if we can't agree in the last round.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"This is the final round, and I'm willing to take a risk. If we don't agree, we both get nothing. I'm hoping you'll see that giving me a bit more is better than getting nothing at all.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
