"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't. I'll propose a split that acknowledges this pressure on Bob while maintaining a favorable position for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, considering my money loses value each round. This is a fair offer, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that I have no inflation penalty and Bob loses 10% value each round, I can negotiate for a better deal. Bob's 550,000 will be worth less next round (495,000 in value for him), while my potential gains maintain their value. I'll make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. At this point, your 420,000 is worth more than what you'd get after more rounds of negotiation. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation factor.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the depreciation, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to Alice's previous one, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's position is weakening with each round due to the 10% depreciation. His offered 520,000 is actually worth only about 379,080 to him now (due to 27.1% depreciation). I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as my money maintains its value while his continues to depreciate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about the situation. At this point, your money has already lost over 27% of its value. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This 350,000 now is worth more to you than a larger number in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know my money is losing value, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering we're already halfway through the rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's 500,000 is now only worth about 295,250 to him (due to 40.95% depreciation), while my potential gains maintain their full value. His negotiating position continues to weaken with each round. A 50/50 split at this point doesn't reflect the reality of our situation, especially since I'm not affected by the depreciation. I'll continue negotiating for a more favorable split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, your money has lost nearly 41% of its value already. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This 300,000 now is worth more than 500,000 would be in the final rounds. Let's end this negotiation now - further delays only hurt your position.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know my position is weakening, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This offer is still relatively fair, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's 480,000 is now only worth about 229,584 to him (due to 52.17% depreciation), while my money maintains its full value. With only 4 rounds left and his money continuing to lose value rapidly, my negotiating position is very strong. There's no reason to accept a 520,000/480,000 split when I can get a much better deal by waiting, as his money will be worth even less in the next rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, your money has lost over 52% of its value now. This 250,000 is actually worth more to you than what you just offered me would be in the final rounds. We only have 3 rounds left after this - time is really working against you. This is a practical offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know time is running out, but I'm trying to hold on to as much as I can. This offer is still somewhat reasonable, considering the rapidly decreasing value of my share. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's 450,000 is now only worth about 174,330 to him (due to 61.26% depreciation). With only 2 rounds remaining after this and his money continuing to lose substantial value, my position is extremely strong. His offer of 550,000 to me is not attractive enough given that I can likely secure a much better deal in the final rounds, as his money will be worth even less then. I'll continue to negotiate for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round, and your money has lost over 61% of its value. If we go to the final round, your share will be worth even less. This 150,000 now is worth more than 450,000 would be in the final round. Take this offer, or we risk getting nothing if we can't agree in the last round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the final round, and I'm willing to take a risk. If we don't agree, we both get nothing. I'm hoping you'll see that giving me a bit more is better than getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this final offer. While I could try to hold out for more, the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in this final round is too high. Even though Bob's 400,000 is only worth about 125,520 to him (due to 68.62% depreciation), getting 600,000 is better than the zero we'd both receive if we don't reach an agreement. This is a pragmatic decision that ensures I get a substantial amount rather than risking everything."
