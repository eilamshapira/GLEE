"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me the entire $1,000,000, it seems unfair to leave her with nothing. Since I don't face inflation pressure but Alice does (20% per round), I can afford to negotiate for a more balanced outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for Alice's time pressure due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion ($400,000) while recognizing that I have a stronger negotiating position due to your inflation pressure."
