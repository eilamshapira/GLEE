"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more than I initially proposed, and considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is now worth 10% less in each round for him, but not for me, I'll try to take advantage of this.
