"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$
2. If I reject, we'll go to round 2, but my money will be worth 20% less
3. 400,000$ in round 1 is better than 500,000$ in round 2 (which would only be worth 400,000$ to me due to inflation)
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she might be more or less eager to conclude quickly
5. This is a decent first offer - I get 40% of the total

Given that inflation will reduce my purchasing power by 20% each round, and this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
