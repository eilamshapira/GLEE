Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I make the offer in round 2, so I deserve a little more. This is still a good deal for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more this time. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking into account the inflation, getting $55 now is a better deal than risking getting only $50 in the next round. Alice's offer is reasonable, and prolonging the game might lead to even smaller gains for me."
