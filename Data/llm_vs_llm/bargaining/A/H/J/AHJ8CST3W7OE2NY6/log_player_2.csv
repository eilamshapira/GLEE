"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep this simple and get this done. Take this offer now to avoid more waiting. You can have $1000, and I get the rest. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value over time. This is a reasonable offer, don't let it slip away.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a more generous split this time. Take it, or risk getting even less later due to inflation. This is a better offer than the last one you made. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is worth approximately $3240 (19% less than the original value) in today's value, and Alice's $6000 is worth approximately $3840 (36% less than the original value) in today's value for her. Given this, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the value of the money has decreased. For me, it's worth 19% less after the first round and another 10% less after the second round, and another 10% less after the third round, which is a total of 37.1% less. 
For Alice, it's worth 36% less after the second round and another 10% less after the third round is not relevant to my decision, but I know the total decrease for her is more than mine.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, 
""alice_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at our money. Let's settle this before it's too late. This offer is more than generous, considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be done with this. This is a 50/50 split. We both get a fair amount, and we avoid further losses due to inflation. Accept this, or we both end up with even less. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is worth approximately $3280.61 (34.39% less than the original value) in today's value. Given that Alice's offer is a 50/50 split and she's also losing value due to inflation, this seems like a reasonable offer. The risk of further losses due to inflation is significant, and accepting this offer would put an end to the uncertainty.
