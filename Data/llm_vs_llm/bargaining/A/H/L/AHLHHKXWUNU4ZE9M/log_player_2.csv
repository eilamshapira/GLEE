"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer, considering that inflation doesn't affect me.

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. It's a fair offer that gives me half of the total amount. 

Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's also no guarantee that Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me, and she might make a less favorable counter-offer if I reject.

Given that this is a perfectly fair split with no downside for accepting immediately, I'll take it.
