"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,500 while she takes $5,500. 

While it's not a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount and there's no inflation effect on my end. However, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer split by making a counter-offer in the next round.

Since there are still 11 rounds left and no inflation penalty for me, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I have the opportunity now. I'll aim for a reasonable offer that Alice would be likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it. It's not too greedy, and it's more balanced than her initial offer. Since neither of us knows if there are inflation effects on the other party, making a reasonable offer increases the chances of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,500 to $4,800
2. I now know that Alice is affected by inflation (9.75% less value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation
4. Her $5,200 is actually worth less to her now due to inflation
5. There are still 9 rounds left

Given that:
- The offer is better than her first one
- Her portion is worth less to her due to inflation
- She might make even worse offers in future rounds due to increasing inflation
- I'm not affected by inflation, so $4,800 maintains its full value for me

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable split, and with Alice's inflation penalty, continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for both of us.
