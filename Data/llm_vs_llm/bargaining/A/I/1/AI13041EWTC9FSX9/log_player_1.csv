"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation risk for myself and try to get the best possible deal now.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** Bob is offering me $500,000. However, due to inflation, it's only worth $500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 to me now.

*   **Comparison:** I need to consider if rejecting and making an offer in Round 3 would be better. If I reject, the money will be worth even less to me in Round 3 (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value).

Given the rapid value loss, and the fact that Bob isn't giving much ground, I should accept the deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
