"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to start with, considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is slightly in my favor since I face 20% inflation per round, so waiting is costly for me. I think this is a reasonable split that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob faces much lower inflation (5% per round) than I do (20% per round). This explains why he rejected my first offer and proposed a split more in his favor. Let me adjust my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is more balanced than my previous offer, accounting for our different inflation rates. Since my time pressure is higher, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share since the money is rapidly losing value for me."
