Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you value getting a fair share, but waiting costs us both—especially you with the steep 20% per round depreciation. I propose a 68-32 split in my favor, which gives you $3200 nominal (worth 80% now) while avoiding further losses. Let's settle now and save both our shares from more depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let’s consider our positions. With every round, our money loses value—but yours is hit much harder (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round). If we delay into round 5, you’d have the floor of what you might secure as proposer—but that deal would still give you roughly the equivalent of about 850 effective dollars, while I would be risking a lower effective payoff in later rounds. I’m proposing a division that gives me $8333 nominal (worth about 7144 in current effective value) and you $1667 nominal (worth about 853 effective). This split reflects our relative discounting and ensures that you get at least what waiting would guarantee you. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you 20% of the value per round. By round 6, your money is worth only 32.8% of its original value, while mine retains 77.4%. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 7—but by then, further devaluation combined with the need to leave me his safe payoff will leave you with almost nothing. I’m giving you 200 nominal dollars now, which is worth about $65.5 in round‑1 terms, a bit more than what your continuation value would allow. Let's settle now before the value slips further. 
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800
