Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you value getting a fair share, but waiting costs us both—especially you with the steep 20% per round depreciation. I propose a 68-32 split in my favor, which gives you $3200 nominal (worth 80% now) while avoiding further losses. Let's settle now and save both our shares from more depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly in your favor, considering my loss due to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8333, ""alice_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Alice, let’s consider our positions. With every round, our money loses value—but yours is hit much harder (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round). If we delay into round 5, you’d have the floor of what you might secure as proposer—but that deal would still give you roughly the equivalent of about 850 effective dollars, while I would be risking a lower effective payoff in later rounds. I’m proposing a division that gives me $8,333 nominal (worth about 7,144 in current effective value) and you $1,667 nominal (worth about 853 effective). This split reflects our relative discounting and ensures that you get at least what waiting would guarantee you. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9800, ""alice_gain"": 200, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait costs you 20% of the value per round. By round 6, your money is worth only 32.8% of its original value, while mine retains 77.4%. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 7—but by then, further devaluation combined with the need to leave me his safe payoff will leave you with almost nothing. I’m giving you 200 nominal dollars now, which is worth about $65.5 in round‑1 terms, a bit more than what your continuation value would allow. Let's settle now before the value slips further.""}"
