"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a slightly unbalanced split where she gets $55 and I get $45. While a 50-50 split would be completely fair, this offer is reasonably close. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, it's possible that Alice faces inflation, which might make her less willing to accept a fair offer in the next round.

Given that the current offer is only $5 away from an even split, and considering the uncertainty about how negotiation might proceed, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a perfectly even split, which I believe is the most fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We both walk away with an equal share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your last offer 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has proposed a compromise between her initial offer (45-55) and my counter-offer (50-50), suggesting a 47.5-52.5 split. She's moved 2.5 units in my direction, which shows willingness to negotiate.

I notice that inflation is affecting Alice (9.75% less value for her) but not me. This means that if negotiations continue, Alice would be more motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

Given that:
1. Alice has moved toward a more even split
2. The current offer is reasonably fair
3. Alice faces inflation that will make future rounds less valuable for her
4. Continued negotiation might lead to a worse outcome for both of us

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
