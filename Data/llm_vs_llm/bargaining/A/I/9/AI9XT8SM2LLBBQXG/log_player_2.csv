"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000.

Since there's no inflation for me, my $400,000 would maintain its value throughout all rounds. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could influence her future decisions.

This is only the first round out of a possible 12, so I have several opportunities to make counteroffers if needed. I could potentially negotiate a better split for myself.

Let me reject this initial offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced counteroffer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is fair to both of us. This would give us each $500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to me - now offering $450,000 instead of her initial $400,000 offer. This is moving closer to an even split. I notice that inflation is affecting Alice's gains (by 9.75% compared to the first round), which may explain why she's more willing to offer me a larger share now.

Since I'm not affected by inflation, my $450,000 would maintain its full value. While this isn't the 50-50 split I proposed, it's a reasonable improvement from her first offer. 

I need to consider that if I reject this and we continue negotiating, Alice's inflation will increase further, potentially making her more willing to give me a better offer. However, there's also risk in continued negotiation if we can't reach agreement within the 12 round limit.

Let me accept this improved offer.
