"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things fairly. Considering the inflation, a slight advantage for me ensures we both benefit in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the 10% inflation penalty I face, Bob's offer of $4,750 is reasonable. If I reject and we continue negotiating, my share will be worth even less in the next round due to the higher inflation rate I face (10% vs Bob's 5%). It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further devaluation of my share."
