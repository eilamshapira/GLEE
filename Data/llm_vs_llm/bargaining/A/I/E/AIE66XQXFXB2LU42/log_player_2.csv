"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has offered me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the entire $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and try to get more next round, I'd need to secure more than $500,000 ($400,000 รท 0.8) for it to be worthwhile, which might be difficult since Alice would have to accept.

Given the significant inflation penalty and uncertainty about Alice's preferences, I'll accept this first offer.
