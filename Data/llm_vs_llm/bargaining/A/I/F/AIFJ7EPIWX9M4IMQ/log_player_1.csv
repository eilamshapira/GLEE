"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with my offer. Given the asymmetry in inflation rates (mine at 10% vs Bob's at 5%), I need to account for this time pressure while still being fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500 Bob, which is slightly less than half but still substantial. Since inflation affects me more severely, accepting now would benefit both of us rather than continuing to additional rounds where our total value decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our inflation rates and the game dynamics.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. Since we're now in round 3, further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us - my share will be worth 19% less than round 1 value if we go to round 4, and yours will be worth 14.3% less. This fair split maximizes our collective value and respects both our positions. Let's conclude this negotiation and both walk away with equal shares."
