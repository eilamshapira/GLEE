"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally. It's fair and square. This way, we both get the same amount, and there's no advantage to either of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn.  I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. This is a better deal than you'll get if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, but it's still a good deal for you. Let's finish this before inflation eats away more of our money.""}

Just to clarify, the actual values we're dividing are still based on the original $100, but their worth has decreased due to inflation. So, for me, the money is now worth 52% of its original value, while for Alice, it's worth 68% of its original value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
