Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% inflation penalty for two rounds, the effective value of the money for me is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. To maximize my gain, I'll aim for a larger share.
