Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation affecting your share, how about we settle with $550000 for me and $450000 for you? This way we account for the changes. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one! While Alice acknowledges the inflation, she's using it as leverage to take a larger share. I need to push for a more balanced deal."

""alice_gain"": 475000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet closer to the middle given the inflation impact on your side. How about $530000 for me and $470000 for you? 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is far from ideal, but with each round, the deal gets worse for me due to the inflation.  It's time to cut my losses and accept a less than favorable outcome."
