"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

With this offer, I'll explain to Bob: ""I propose a 55-45 split, which is fairly balanced while accounting for the first-mover position."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $47 now, it's actually worth $44.65 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. If negotiations continue, the value keeps decreasing
4. Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, giving me 47% of the pot
5. The risk of getting an even worse deal later outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating further
