"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. If you reject, you'll already lose 10% value in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the inflation impact, this offer still leaves you with a good share while compensating me for the value loss from last round. Let's settle this now to minimize further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4500, but with 10% inflation = $4050 effective value
   * This is less than my initial proposal but still substantial

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (20% for me)
   * I'd need to propose a much higher nominal amount to make up for it
   * Bob might reject again, leading to further losses
   * There's risk in continuing

3. Bob's offer is reasonable considering:
   * The inflation impact
   * The need to conclude quickly
   * It's not too far from a 50-50 split
