"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose giving myself $550,000 (55%) and Bob $450,000 (45%). This is a reasonable split that respects both parties while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects, the next round will have the money worth 10% less to me, so this is a fair initial offer."
