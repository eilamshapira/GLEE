"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair, equal split offer right from the start. Since there's no inflation effect on my end, and I would get half of the total amount ($5,000), there's no strategic advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer. A 50-50 split is considered the most equitable outcome.
