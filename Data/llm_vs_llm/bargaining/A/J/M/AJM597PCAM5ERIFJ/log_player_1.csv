"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $4500 I would receive is actually worth $3600 (20% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 2 rounds have passed, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400 for me.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the decreased value. I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor to account for the inflation disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 3800, 
""bob_gain"": 6200, 
""message"": ""Let's settle before inflation eats away more value""}"
