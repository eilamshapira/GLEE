"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is a 40%-60% split in her favor.

Since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I think I should try for a more favorable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that gives us both a substantial amount.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us receiving half a million dollars. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint welfare."
