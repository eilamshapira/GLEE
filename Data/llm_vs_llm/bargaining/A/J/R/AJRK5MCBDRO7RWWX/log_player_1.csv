"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer given the inflation risk that affects me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly advantageous split for me since I face 10% inflation each round. This is fair because if we go to round 2, the $100 will only be worth $90 to me, making a 50/50 split actually disadvantageous. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away happy!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Given your higher inflation rate, it's in both our interests to settle quickly. If we don't, the value decreases for both of us, but at different rates. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
