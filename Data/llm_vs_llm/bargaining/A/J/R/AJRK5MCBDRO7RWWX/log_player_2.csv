"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly advantageous split for me since I face 10% inflation each round. This is fair because if we go to round 2, the $100 will only be worth $90 to me, making a 50/50 split actually disadvantageous. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $45 and Alice $55, and considering the inflation, if I reject this offer, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me in the next round. This means the $100 will be worth $95 to me, but I don't know the inflation rate for Alice. Given that Alice has a higher inflation rate (10%) than me (5%), it might be beneficial to accept this offer to avoid further devaluation. However, I should also consider making a counteroffer that could potentially give me a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the total amount is now worth 5% less to me, which means it's $95 to me. However, for the sake of the proposal, I'll still consider the original $100.

I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer to me, considering her higher inflation rate might put pressure on her to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later.
