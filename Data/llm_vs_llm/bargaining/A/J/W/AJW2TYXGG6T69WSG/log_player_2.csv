"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this quickly to avoid losing value to inflation. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair, or if I should counter-offer in the next round.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. This is not an even split. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% to $95. 

If I were to propose a 50/50 split in the next round, I would offer Alice $47.50 and keep $47.50 for myself. This is better for me than the current $40, but Alice might reject it since she'd get less than the $60 she's currently proposing for herself.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
