"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the $100 evenly at $50 each. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's end this on a balanced note. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
