"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 by giving me $55 and you $45. Accepting this offer now helps both of us close the deal quicklyâ€”especially since additional rounds will reduce the total value for me. Looking forward to a swift agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer earlier. To keep things fair and to avoid any further loss from delay, I propose we split the $100 equally: $50 each. I believe this is a fair deal considering the cost of additional rounds. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your fair 50/50 split offer. While I value the money a bit less now due to inflation, I believe locking in an immediate agreement is in our mutual best interest. Looking forward to wrapping this up!""}"
