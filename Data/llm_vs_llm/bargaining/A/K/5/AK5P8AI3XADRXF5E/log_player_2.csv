"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 by giving me $55 and you $45. Accepting this offer now helps both of us close the deal quicklyâ€”especially since additional rounds will reduce the total value for me. Looking forward to a swift agreement! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
