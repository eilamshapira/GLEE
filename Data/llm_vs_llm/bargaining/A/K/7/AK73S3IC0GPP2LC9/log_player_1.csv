"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob in this negotiation game.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face a 20% inflation penalty each round if we don't reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While I originally proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, I recognize that due to the 20% inflation for me, accepting a fair 50-50 split now is better than potentially receiving less value in future rounds."
