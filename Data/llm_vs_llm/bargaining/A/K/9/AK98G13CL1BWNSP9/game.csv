58.0,42.0,"Bob, my previous offer was fair, but I'll sweeten the deal slightly. 58 for me, 42 for you. Remember your money is losing value faster than mine. This is still a good deal for you considering the inflation. Let's close this now!",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"I'm willing to split it 50/50, considering the significant loss in value I've already incurred. It's a fair deal at this point, and we should both take it to avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
