"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've proposed a slightly higher amount for myself because my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than yours (5%). This means the money loses value faster for me in later rounds. This is a fair split considering our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing this offer considering that the money loses value for you significantly faster as the rounds progress. By ensuring I secure a bit more now, we'll still have a fair distribution accounting for future reductions. I hope this is acceptable to you given the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical here. The inflation rates create a significant disadvantage for me at 20% compared to your 5%. With each round, my position weakens much faster than yours. This offer is fair when accounting for our different inflation pressures. If we keep going back and forth, I'll be forced to accept less and less due to my higher inflation rate, which isn't fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, given how quickly the value is dropping for you, I've adjusted my offer so you still get a substantial portion considering your inflation impact. I hope we can agree on this to ensure you still get a fair deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're five rounds in and the money is now worth 59% of its original value for me, but still 81% for you. This significant difference means any further delay hurts me much more than you. This split accounts for our unequal inflation rates while being fair to both of us. Let's not waste more value through continued negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
