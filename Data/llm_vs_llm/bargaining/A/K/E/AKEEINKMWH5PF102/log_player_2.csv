"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering a 50-50 split right away in the first round, this is a fair offer. If I reject, I would need to make an offer next, and with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me. Taking the 50$ now is better than potentially getting a slightly higher amount later that would be worth less due to inflation.
