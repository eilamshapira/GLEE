"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, and mine doesn't depreciate, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. When I make my offer in round 2, Alice's share will only be worth 90% of its nominal value to her.

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this even split and proposing something more favorable to me in the next round, knowing Alice will be more inclined to accept due to the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her this round, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for her to accept. If she rejects, her money will be worth even less next round.

A 60-40 split in my favor means Alice gets $40, which at 90% value is worth $36 to her. If she rejects and we go another round, any amount would be worth even less to her.
