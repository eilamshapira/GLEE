"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a split where I get $350,000 and she gets $650,000. I need to consider that if I reject, the total amount will be worth less in the next round due to inflation, but I'd get to make a counter-offer.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will be worth 5% less to me, so the total value becomes $950,000 from my perspective. This would still allow me to potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

Since this is the first round and I believe I can propose a more favorable split, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while giving Alice a reason to accept rather than continuing to the next round.

Since Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty if she rejects (reducing the pot's value to $900,000 from her perspective), while I only face a 5% penalty, I have a slight advantage in bargaining. I'll propose a more balanced split that still gives her incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable, and considering Alice would lose more value to inflation if she rejects (10% vs my 5%), this should be attractive to her. A 50-50 split is a standard fair division that respects both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer from Alice. She's now offering me $390,000, which is $40,000 more than her initial offer of $350,000. However, I need to account for inflation.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round. So this $390,000 offer is equivalent to about $351,975 in round 1 value ($390,000 Ã— 0.9025).

If I reject and we go to round 4, the total amount will be worth even less due to additional inflation. I would get to make another counter-offer, but Alice would face even steeper inflation (19% + 10% = 29% from round 1 value).

Alice has improved her offer slightly in real terms, and we're already experiencing significant inflation effects. While I might be able to negotiate further, the risks of continued inflation are substantial.

I'll accept this offer.
