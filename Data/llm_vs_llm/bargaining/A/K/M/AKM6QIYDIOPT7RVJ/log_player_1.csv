"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Round 1

I'll make a fair offer that respects both our interests while accounting for the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round if we delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Round 3

With inflation continuing to affect my gains, I'll adjust my offer to be more balanced while still accounting for the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and you get $48. This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I've already accumulated while offering you a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
