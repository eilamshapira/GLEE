"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for Bob (10% per round), I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept. If he rejects, both of us will get less value in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair split considering I'm making the first offer, but it's not too greedy. It's better for Bob to accept this now than to wait for the next round where the money will be worth less for both of us."
