"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

Current offer: $45 for me
If I reject: Next round the $100 will effectively be worth $90 for me and $80 for Alice

This is a pretty fair initial offer from Alice at 45/55. If I reject, we'll both lose value and it might be harder to reach an agreement. The loss in value from waiting likely outweighs any potential gain from negotiating.
