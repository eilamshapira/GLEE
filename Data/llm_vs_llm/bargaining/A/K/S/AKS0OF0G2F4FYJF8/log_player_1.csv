"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation issue I'm facing. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me in each subsequent round, I should aim for a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering you $350,000, Bob. This division gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face a 20% inflation penalty if we move to another round, which you don't have to worry about. This makes accepting now mutually beneficial."
