60.0,40.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on.,Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face risks with further negotiations and inflation, so let's agree to an equal division and conclude this now. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the fair split, but considering the inflation affects me more, I think a 55-45 split in my favor would be more equitable. Let's reconsider in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact, I think this split is fair. It gives you a good amount while accounting for the risk we both face. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I notice you're affected by inflation more severely than I am (19% vs. my 9.75%). This means delays hurt you more than they hurt me. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for you compared to further rounds where inflation will reduce your gains even more significantly. Let's conclude this now before both our shares diminish further.",Bob,4,
