Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face risks with further negotiations and inflation, so let's agree to an equal division and conclude this now. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you're affected by inflation more severely than I am (19% vs. my 9.75%). This means delays hurt you more than they hurt me. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for you compared to further rounds where inflation will reduce your gains even more significantly. Let's conclude this now before both our shares diminish further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
