"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that money will be worth 5% less to me in each subsequent round.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, the maximum value to me would be 95% of $100 = $95. So theoretically I could offer something that gives me more than $40 while still being reasonable to Alice.

I'll reject this offer as I believe we can reach a more balanced division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that takes into account the inflation factor while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face risks with further negotiations and inflation, so let's agree to an equal division and conclude this now. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact, I think this split is fair. It gives you a good amount while accounting for the risk we both face. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. Alice is now offering me $42 out of the $100, which is slightly better than her initial offer of $40. 

Taking inflation into account:
- For me, the $42 is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so it's effectively worth about $37.91
- If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount would be worth even less to me

Alice has now revealed that her inflation rate (19%) is higher than mine (9.75%), which gives me some negotiating leverage. However, with each passing round, both of us lose value.

Since Alice only improved her offer slightly and the adjusted value to me is still less than $40, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I notice you're affected by inflation more severely than I am (19% vs. my 9.75%). This means delays hurt you more than they hurt me. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually beneficial for you compared to further rounds where inflation will reduce your gains even more significantly. Let's conclude this now before both our shares diminish further.""}"
