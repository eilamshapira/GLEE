4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, since the money devalues 10% for you each round but not for me, a fair split should account for this time advantage. I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is reasonable given the depreciation factor, and I'm willing to accept immediately so you don't lose more value in later rounds.",Bob,2,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, your last offer moved in the wrong direction - you asked for more despite facing inflation. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 10% more value, while mine doesn't. This means time favors me in negotiations. I'm offering $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is actually generous considering the game mechanics, and we should settle now before inflation further reduces the value of your share. We still have 8 rounds left, and my position only strengthens with each passing round.",Bob,4,
