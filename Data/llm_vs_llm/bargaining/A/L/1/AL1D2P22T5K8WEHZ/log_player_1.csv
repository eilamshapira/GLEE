"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, since the money devalues 10% for you each round but not for me, a fair split should account for this time advantage. I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is reasonable given the depreciation factor, and I'm willing to accept immediately so you don't lose more value in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I should think carefully about my decision.

Since the total value of the money is $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000 in my perspective (10% less due to inflation), Bob's offer gives me $4,000 out of $9,000, which is approximately 44.4% of the total value.

Given that this is only the second round and I still have 10 more rounds to negotiate, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in each of the two rounds), I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

The total value of the money is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000 in my perspective.

I'll offer Bob $3,500 and keep $6,500 for myself, but considering the inflation, the actual value I'm proposing is $6,500 out of $8,000.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm making a more favorable offer for myself this time. Let's settle before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your last offer moved in the wrong direction - you asked for more despite facing inflation. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 10% more value, while mine doesn't. This means time favors me in negotiations. I'm offering $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is actually generous considering the game mechanics, and we should settle now before inflation further reduces the value of your share. We still have 8 rounds left, and my position only strengthens with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is essentially the same as my previous offer, but in reverse. Considering the inflation factor, the total value of the money is $10,000 * 0.729 = $7,290 in my perspective (10% less in each of the three rounds, which is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, then 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81, and 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729).

Bob's offer gives me $3,500 out of $7,290, which is approximately 48% of the total value. However, since the value of my share decreases by 10% each round, I need to consider the potential future value.

Given that Bob's position strengthens with each passing round due to the inflation mechanic, and I still have 8 rounds left, I should think carefully about my decision. Accepting this offer would give me a guaranteed amount, but rejecting it might lead to a better deal in the future.

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of my potential share, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.
