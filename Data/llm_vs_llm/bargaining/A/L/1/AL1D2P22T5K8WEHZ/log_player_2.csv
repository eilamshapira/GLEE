"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $5,500 and taking $4,500. While she claims this is generous, let me consider the situation:

1) With each round, Alice loses 10% of the value, but I don't lose any value
2) This gives me negotiating leverage in later rounds
3) Since we're only in Round 1, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer

Given these factors, I believe I can achieve a more favorable split by continuing to negotiate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation effect while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, since the money devalues 10% for you each round but not for me, a fair split should account for this time advantage. I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is reasonable given the depreciation factor, and I'm willing to accept immediately so you don't lose more value in later rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a more favorable offer for myself this time. Let's settle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $3,500 and taking $6,500, which is significantly worse for me than her first offer. She's actually asking for more money despite the inflation affecting her, which doesn't make logical sense.

Let's consider the key factors:
1) The money doesn't lose value for me at all
2) Alice is now facing 19% inflation on her share
3) We still have 9 rounds remaining
4) Her offer has gotten worse for me, not better

This offer is not reasonable given my stronger negotiating position. As rounds progress, Alice's inflation penalty increases, which should lead to better offers for me, not worse ones.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, your last offer moved in the wrong direction - you asked for more despite facing inflation. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 10% more value, while mine doesn't. This means time favors me in negotiations. I'm offering $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is actually generous considering the game mechanics, and we should settle now before inflation further reduces the value of your share. We still have 8 rounds left, and my position only strengthens with each passing round.""}"
