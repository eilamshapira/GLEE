"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair deal? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to factor in the inflation penalty. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means in the next round, the maximum value I could get would be $9,000 ($10,000 - 10%).

Even if I were to take all $10,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $9,000 to me. So getting $5,000 now is better than potentially getting less than $5,000 in future rounds after accounting for inflation.
