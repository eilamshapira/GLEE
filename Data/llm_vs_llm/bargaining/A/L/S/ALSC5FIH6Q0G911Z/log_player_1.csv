"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money is worth less now for me.

Let's calculate the value of the money for me now. With 5% inflation, my money is worth 95% of what it was in round 1.

If I accept this offer, I get $50, but it's only worth 95% of its face value to me now.

Since I have 12 rounds, I will **reject** this offer for now.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time for my offer in round 3. Remember, the money is worth even less for me now due to inflation.

Given that I rejected Bob's offer, I will make an offer that is slightly better for me than the previous rejected one.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. I now have 14.26% inflation, which means my money is worth 85.74% of its original value.

*   **My gain:** $45.
*   **My effective gain:** $45 \* 0.8574 = $38.58

I also know that I have rejected some offers from previous rounds. Since I have 8 rounds left, I will keep rejecting this one.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm making an offer in round 5. My money is worth even less now. I need to consider how much I'm losing with each round.

I need to get a little more aggressive to try and secure a better outcome.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down. I'm in round 6, and my money is worth 22.62% less than in round 1, which means it's worth 77.38% of its original value.

*   **My gain:** $40
*   **My effective gain:** $40 \* 0.7738 = $30.95

I have six rounds left and I am not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation effect on me. Since I have rejected similar offers before, and since I may get a better offer later, I will reject this one.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm making my offer in round 7. The money is worth even less for me, so I need to try and get a better offer from Bob.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. The money I gain is worth 30.17% less than in round 1, or 69.83% of its original value.

*   **My gain:** $35
*   **My effective gain:** $35 \* 0.6983 = $24.44

I only have 4 rounds left. At this point, I need to seriously consider the risk of getting nothing. This is a very low offer for me, but the risk is increasing. I will accept this.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
