"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a balanced first offer, considering that Bob loses 10% value each round if he declines.

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If you decline, your money will be worth less next round due to your inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get the same amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject Bob's offer:
- I can make a new offer in round 3
- But Bob's money will be worth another 10% less, so he'll be more desperate to make a deal
- This gives me more leverage for a better split in my favor

If I accept:
- I get $5000 now, which is less than my initial offer
- Bob gets $5000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4500 to him
- This is actually the same effective value I offered him in round 1

Since Bob rejected my reasonable first offer and is now effectively asking for the same deal but structured differently, I should reject and use my stronger negotiating position in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now that Bob's money is worth 20% less due to two rounds of inflation, I can leverage this position.

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Due to two rounds of inflation, $4000 now is actually worth only $3200 to you. If you reject this offer, the next round will reduce your value by another 10%. This is your best opportunity to maximize your actual value.""
