Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to two rounds of inflation, $4000 now is actually worth only $3200 to you. If you reject this offer, the next round will reduce your value by another 10%. This is your best opportunity to maximize your actual value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
