6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be practical - your share is now worth significantly less due to 27% inflation, and will drop another 10% if you reject. I'm offering you $4000, which despite inflation is still a substantial amount. Further delays will only decrease the real value of your share. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.",Alice,5,

,,,Alice,6,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Your share has lost over 40% of its value due to inflation, and will lose another 10% if you reject. My $3500 offer now is worth more than a larger nominal amount in future rounds.

,,,Bob,7,reject

,,,Alice,8,reject
7000.0,3000.0,Your share has lost over 52% of its value and will lose another 10% if you reject. Even a smaller nominal amount now is worth more than a larger amount next round.
