"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the value loss I've already experienced and ensures a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 55-45 split in Bob's favor isn't optimal for me. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round while I don't, I have a stronger negotiating position. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects this dynamic."

""message"": ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Consider that if you reject, your next round's money will be worth another 10% less. This is a fair offer given the circumstances - you still get a substantial amount while accounting for the inflation you've faced.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation impact on my share, now worth 27% less than in round 1, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer reflects the urgent need to compensate for the value I've lost and ensures a fair deal given the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's argument about inflation actually works against him - the longer this goes on, the weaker his position becomes since his share loses value while mine doesn't. A 60-40 split in his favor is not acceptable when I can make a better offer in the next round and his future gains will be worth even less."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - your share is now worth significantly less due to 27% inflation, and will drop another 10% if you reject. I'm offering you $4000, which despite inflation is still a substantial amount. Further delays will only decrease the real value of your share. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With my share now worth 34.39% less than in round 1, and facing another 10% drop if we continue, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This offer is necessary to counteract the severe inflation impact on my portion, ensuring I receive a fair value despite the ongoing devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's position continues to weaken with each round as inflation erodes his share's value. His request for an even larger share (65%) despite his weakening position is not logical. A 65-35 split in his favor is especially unfavorable when I can make a counter-offer where my money retains full value while his continues to depreciate."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that my share is now worth 46.86% less than in round 1, and will decrease further, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This is crucial to offset the significant inflation I've endured, ensuring I receive a fair value despite the ongoing devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's strategy is counter-productive. His share has lost over 50% of its value, yet he's asking for an even larger nominal amount (70%). This makes no economic sense - his $7000 is worth less than $3500 would have been in earlier rounds. I'll counter with an offer that reflects the reality of his rapidly deteriorating position."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With my share now worth 56.95% less than in round 1, and facing yet another 10% drop, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This is essential to counteract the drastic inflation impact on my portion, ensuring I receive a fair value despite the severe ongoing devaluation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's strategy continues to be irrational. His $7500 is now worth less than $3000 would have been in earlier rounds due to the 61% inflation he's experienced. Asking for an even larger nominal amount (75%) when his purchasing power is drastically reduced makes no economic sense. I'll maintain my strong negotiating position as my money retains full value while his continues to rapidly depreciate."

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly desperate and economically unsound. His $8000 is now worth only about $2,500 in real value due to the 68.62% inflation he's experienced. Meanwhile, my money retains full value. His request for an 80-20 split ignores the fact that his purchasing power continues to plummet. I'll counter with an offer that reflects the economic reality of his severely weakened position."

Bob's position has become extremely weak, with his money worth less than 26% of its original value. His $8500 offer is now worth only about $2,125 in real value (from round 1), while he's asking me to accept just $1500. This makes no economic sense. Each round further deteriorates his bargaining power while mine remains unchanged. I'll continue to leverage this strong position in the next round."

Bob's position continues to deteriorate dramatically. His $9000 is now worth only about $1,850 in real value (compared to round 1) due to the 79.41% inflation he's experienced. Yet he's asking me to accept just $1000 of inflation-free money. His desperate attempt to get a 90-10 split ignores the fact that his purchasing power is nearly decimated.

Bob's position is now catastrophic. His $9500 is worth only about $1,585 in real value due to the 83.32% inflation, yet he's asking me to accept just $500 of inflation-free money. A 95-5 split makes no economic sense when his money has lost over 4/5ths of its value. His bargaining power has been almost completely eroded while mine remains unchanged.

Bob's position is now virtually worthless. His $9900 is only worth about $1,338 in real value due to the 86.49% inflation he's experienced. Asking for a 99-1 split when his money has lost nearly 87% of its value is completely irrational. Even getting almost all the nominal amount doesn't help him when it's worth so little. I retain my full purchasing power while his continues to approach zero. There's no reason to accept such a low offer of $100 when I can counter with an even stronger position."

This has become absurd. Bob's $9990 is now worth only about $1,093 in real value due to 89.06% inflation. Taking almost the entire nominal amount (99.9%) doesn't help when the money has lost nearly 90% of its value. His offer of just $10 to me is completely unreasonable when my money retains full purchasing power. His bargaining position has been almost completely destroyed while mine remains at full strength. The rational move is to reject and counter with an offer that reflects this extreme disparity in our positions."

The situation has reached the extreme. Bob's $9999 is now worth only about $885 in real value due to 91.14% inflation. Even getting 99.99% of the nominal amount is meaningless when it has lost over 90% of its value. His offer of just $1 to me is completely irrational when my money maintains full purchasing power.
