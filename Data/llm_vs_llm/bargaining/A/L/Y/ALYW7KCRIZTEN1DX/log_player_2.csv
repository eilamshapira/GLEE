"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. A 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject this offer:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
2. I'll get to make the next proposal
3. But Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

With a 10% inflation penalty for each round, waiting could be risky. Even if I propose a better split next round, the money will be worth less to me, and Alice might reject it anyway.

$5000 right now is better than risking a potentially smaller real value in future rounds.
