55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point, and avoids us losing value with inflation.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, since the value of money is decreasing more rapidly for you, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This way, we can both still get a reasonable amount despite the inflation.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your reasoning, but 60/40 is too skewed. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. Remember we both lose more value each round, so let's find a deal we can both live with now.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I see your point about meeting in the middle. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your side, I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we can both secure a fair share before the value drops further.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I propose an even split: 50 for me, 50 for you. It's fair, and avoids further losses. Let's lock it in now.",Alice,5,
