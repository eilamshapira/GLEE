Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the value of money is decreasing more rapidly for you, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This way, we can both still get a reasonable amount despite the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
