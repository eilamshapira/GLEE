"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to be fair but also ensure I get a reasonable amount, especially considering the inflation factor in later rounds.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for slightly more than half (55%), anticipating that Bob might counter-offer in later rounds, and the money will be worth less then.
*   I'm still offering Bob a significant amount ($4500) which should make the offer appealing enough for him to accept in this first round."
