"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is proposing to take the larger share (5500$) while giving me 4500$. While this isn't an even split, it's relatively close to 50-50, and importantly, accepting now means we avoid the 10% inflation penalty that would apply in the next round.

If I reject, the total amount will decrease to 9000$ in the next round. Even if I then proposed a more favorable split for myself, the total amount available would be less, so I might end up with less money overall.

4500$ is a reasonable offer, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting now a prudent choice.
