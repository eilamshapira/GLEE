Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a slightly better deal for you, but still a fair split? I hope this works for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'll explain my reasoning here:

While Alice's offer seems generous on the surface, I need to factor in the inflation.  A $55 gain now is worth considerably less than it was in Round 1.  It's still early in the game, so I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I need to factor in the inflation hitting me each round.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - this offer gives me a bit more to offset the losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation. Let's meet halfway with a 40-60 split in your favor this time. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer gives me a good deal more than what I would have gotten from an even split at the start, offsetting the inflation. Accepting now is better than risking a worse offer later."
