600000.0,400000.0,I propose we split the money with me receiving $600000 and you receiving $400000. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is actually better for you than waiting another round due to your 20% inflation rate. If we go to round 3, the million dollars would only be worth $800000 to you, so getting $450000 now is better than getting even 60% of that reduced amount later. Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair compromise.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split the money equally, $500000 each. Given the inflation rates, this seems like the fairest option for both of us at this point.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a split where I get $600000 and you get $400000. Consider our inflation rates carefully: the money is now worth 14.26% less to me but 48.8% less to you compared to round 1. If we go to round 5, you'll face another 20% inflation, making the total worth less than $400000 to you even if you got it all. This offer is economically rational for both of us given our different inflation positions, and I hope we can conclude the negotiation here.",Bob,4,
