"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me receiving $600000 and you receiving $400000. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation rates for each of us.

If I reject Alice's offer of $400,000 now, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to 5% inflation for me, the total value would effectively be $950,000 from my perspective. For Alice, with 20% inflation, the total value would be only $800,000 from her perspective.

Given these inflation rates, I believe I can propose a better split for myself in the next round that Alice would still rationally accept. Since her money loses value faster than mine, she has a stronger incentive to agree sooner.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is actually better for you than waiting another round due to your 20% inflation rate. If we go to round 3, the million dollars would only be worth $800,000 to you, so getting $450,000 now is better than getting even 60% of that reduced amount later. Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally, $500000 each. Given the inflation rates, this seems like the fairest option for both of us at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer considering our different inflation rates.

Since we're now in round 3, my inflation rate means the money is worth 9.75% less to me, while Alice's money is worth 36% less to her. This significant difference in inflation rates puts me in a stronger negotiating position.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another proposal. The total pot would then be worth 14.26% less to me (compounding the 5% inflation), but a substantial 48.8% less to Alice (compounding the 20% inflation). This means Alice has a much stronger incentive to settle now.

Given that I'm in the stronger position due to our different inflation rates, and I could potentially get a better deal in the next round that Alice would still rationally accept, I should reject this offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a split where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. Consider our inflation rates carefully: the money is now worth 14.26% less to me but 48.8% less to you compared to round 1. If we go to round 5, you'll face another 20% inflation, making the total worth less than $400,000 to you even if you got it all. This offer is economically rational for both of us given our different inflation positions, and I hope we can conclude the negotiation here.""}"
