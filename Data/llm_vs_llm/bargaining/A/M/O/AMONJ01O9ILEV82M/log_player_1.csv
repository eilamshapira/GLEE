"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, taking into account that there's a 5% inflation effect for me per round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair 50-50 split. If we delay and go to additional rounds, the money loses value for me due to inflation, so this is the most efficient solution for both of us.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we don't lose more value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation effects for both of us.

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,

  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I now understand inflation affects you more severely (20% per round vs my 5%). This split is fair considering our different inflation rates, and we should finalize now before we both lose more value.""
