"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a fair 50-50 split. If we delay and go to additional rounds, the money loses value for me due to inflation, so this is the most efficient solution for both of us.

# Alice gain: 5000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we don't lose more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I now understand inflation affects you more severely (20% per round vs my 5%). This split is fair considering our different inflation rates, and we should finalize now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
