6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you're facing inflation, but your initial offer was too steep. This split acknowledges that while giving us both a fair deal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial offer. Due to the 5% inflation per round, my $5500 is actually worth $5225 to me now. This is a fair middle ground that accounts for both our interests.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, time is ticking and your share is losing value. Let's be practical - this offer provides a good amount for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I'm making a more moderate offer. With the current 19.25% inflation impact, my $5200 is actually worth only about $4200 to me. This split is becoming more favorable to you with each round. Let's reach an agreement now before inflation reduces my share even further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we're at the halfway point. This offer is firm and reflects the time we have left. It's a good deal for you considering the ongoing inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which due to the 26.49% inflation I'm facing, means my $5000 is actually worth only $3675 to me while your $5000 remains at full value. This is already quite favorable to you, and further delays will only make both of us worse off. Let's agree now.",Alice,7,
