"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you're facing inflation, but your initial offer was too steep. This split acknowledges that while giving us both a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since with 5% inflation, my $4500 is already worth only $4275, and this gap will continue to grow if we keep negotiating. I'll make a more moderate counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial offer. Due to the 5% inflation per round, my $5500 is actually worth $5225 to me now. This is a fair middle ground that accounts for both our interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and your share is losing value. Let's be practical - this offer provides a good amount for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 14.26% inflation, my $4300 would only be worth about $3687, which is too low considering we started with $10,000. Bob's share remains at full value while mine keeps decreasing. I'll make another counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a more moderate offer. With the current 19.25% inflation impact, my $5200 is actually worth only about $4200 to me. This split is becoming more favorable to you with each round. Let's reach an agreement now before inflation reduces my share even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're at the halfway point. This offer is firm and reflects the time we have left. It's a good deal for you considering the ongoing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 22.62% inflation, my $4000 would only be worth about $3095, which is less than a third of the total value. Even though we're halfway through, accepting such a low effective value isn't reasonable when Bob's share remains at full value. I'll make another counter-offer to find middle ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which due to the 26.49% inflation I'm facing, means my $5000 is actually worth only $3675 to me while your $5000 remains at full value. This is already quite favorable to you, and further delays will only make both of us worse off. Let's agree now.""}"
