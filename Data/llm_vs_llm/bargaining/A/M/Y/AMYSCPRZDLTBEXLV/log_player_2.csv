"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you're facing inflation, but your initial offer was too steep. This split acknowledges that while giving us both a fair deal.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've lowered my request from the initial offer. Due to the 5% inflation per round, my $5500 is actually worth $5225 to me now. This is a fair middle ground that accounts for both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to position her offer as a compromise, it's important to remember that the value of her share is decreasing, not mine. Holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is still the stronger strategy."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5700,
""alice_gain"": 4300,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a more moderate offer. With the current 19.25% inflation impact, my $5200 is actually worth only about $4200 to me. This split is becoming more favorable to you with each round. Let's reach an agreement now before inflation reduces my share even further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and trying to frame the offer in a way that seems generous to me. However, while her buying power decreases, the actual amount of money remains the same. I'm willing to wait for a more favorable offer as we approach the halfway point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're at the halfway point. This offer is firm and reflects the time we have left. It's a good deal for you considering the ongoing inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which due to the 26.49% inflation I'm facing, means my $5000 is actually worth only $3675 to me while your $5000 remains at full value. This is already quite favorable to you, and further delays will only make both of us worse off. Let's agree now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is fair, and waiting any longer risks Alice proposing an even less favorable deal for me. It's time to accept and secure a reasonable share."
