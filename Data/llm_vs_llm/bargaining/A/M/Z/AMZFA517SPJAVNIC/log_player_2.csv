"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is now $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. However, the actual division is still based on the original $1,000,000.

I'll make a proposal that is slightly in my favor but still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I would get is $420,000 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) = $268,800.

For Alice, the value she would get is $580,000 * 0.81 (since 10% less in round 1 and another 9% less in round 2, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) = $469,800.

Given the significant decrease in value for me and considering Alice's offer, I think it's time to accept.
