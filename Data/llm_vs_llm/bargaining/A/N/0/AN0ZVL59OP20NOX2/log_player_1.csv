"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face (20% vs Bob's 10%). Since we both want to maximize our gain and avoid going through too many rounds, I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair split considering I face higher inflation risk in future rounds. I offer Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept this 50/50 split now:
   * My $50 is worth 20% less, so effectively $40
   * Bob's $50 is worth 10% less, so effectively $45

This is actually worse for me than my initial offer would have been. Given that I face higher inflation penalties, a 50/50 split puts me at a disadvantage. I'll reject and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, inflation has increased (I lose 40% value, Bob loses 20% value compared to round 1). I need to account for this while still making an attractive offer to avoid further rounds of value decay.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm offering this split because:
1. Given the higher inflation I face, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value
2. Even with Bob's 20% inflation penalty, his $35 is still worth $28, which is a significant amount
3. Further delays will hurt both of us, but me more severely"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept this 45/55 split now:
   * My $45 is worth 48.8% less, so effectively about $23.04
   * Bob's $55 is worth 27.1% less, so effectively about $40.10

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I'll face even higher inflation (60% vs Bob's 30%)
   * We're already in round 4 out of 12, but the value is decreasing rapidly

The offer is getting worse for me, but continuing further will result in even more value loss. While this isn't ideal, getting $23.04 in effective value now is better than risking further rounds with higher inflation.
