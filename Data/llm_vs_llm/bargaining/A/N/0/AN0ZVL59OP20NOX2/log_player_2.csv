"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $40 out of $100. While I'd prefer a more equal split, I need to consider the inflation penalties. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. Let me make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more equitable offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and considering that you face higher inflation (20% per round) than I do (10% per round), accepting this offer now would be better than continuing to negotiate and losing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has actually offered me less than before, which doesn't make sense given the inflation penalties we're both facing. The money is already worth 19% less to me and 36% less to Alice than in the first round.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where my inflation penalty will be even higher, and I'll need to make a new offer. I need to consider whether I can reach a better outcome by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 4 and inflation is reducing the value for both of us (especially for Alice), I'll make an offer that's more favorable to both of us than continuing this negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and you get $45. This is reasonable considering that:
1) Inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round vs. my 10%)
2) We've already lost significant value from the original $100
3) If we continue negotiating, we both stand to lose even more
4) This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the current proposer"
