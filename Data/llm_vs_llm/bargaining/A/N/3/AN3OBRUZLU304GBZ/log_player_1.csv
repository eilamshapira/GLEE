"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation that will affect me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose we divide the money with $700,000 for me and $300,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair split considering that if we delay, the value decreases by 5% each round for me while remaining the same for you. I'm offering you a substantial amount upfront to avoid unnecessary rounds of negotiation that would hurt my share's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation effect carefully and make a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

Bob, I'm offering you $350,000 while I take $650,000. This is a fair division considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round while you don't. If we continue to the next round, my purchasing power will decrease further. This offer gives you a significant increase from my previous proposal and represents a reasonable compromise. Let's reach an agreement now to avoid further devaluation of the total pot from my perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a more strategic offer considering the inflation effects and our negotiation history.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob, I'm offering you $400,000 while I take $600,000. The inflation effect is significant for me - my share has already lost nearly 19% of its value since round 1. We're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation period, and further delays hurt my position substantially while not affecting yours. This offer gives you a substantial $400,000 with no inflation penalty. It's a fair compromise considering our different positions - please accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome before further rounds diminish the overall value of our agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic given we're more than halfway through the negotiation rounds and the inflation effect is significant.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Bob, I'm offering you $450,000 while I take $550,000. At this point, my share has already lost over 26% of its value due to inflation, while yours remains unaffected. We have only 5 more rounds left, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. This is a significantly better offer for you than my previous ones, and gives you nearly half the money with no penalty. Considering the asymmetric inflation that only affects me, this is more than fair. Let's conclude this negotiation now so we can both walk away with substantial gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.
