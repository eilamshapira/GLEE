"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $300,000 and wants to keep $700,000. Since money loses 5% value each round for Alice but maintains value for me, I have some leverage in negotiations. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where her portion would effectively be worth 5% less to her.

This initial offer gives Alice 70% of the money, which seems too advantageous for her given the inflation penalty she faces. I can likely get a better deal by negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I know Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't, I can propose a more balanced split. If she rejects, her next gain would be worth less to her. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as we only have 12 rounds total and both get nothing if we don't agree.

I'll propose a more equitable split that still gives her a good incentive to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split that acknowledges both our positions. For Alice, waiting another round would make her portion worth 5% less, so she has an incentive to accept now rather than delay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has increased my share from $300K to $350K, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. Her portion of $650K is now worth about 9.75% less to her due to inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (about 14.75% less than original)
4. However, I believe I can still get a better deal since I'm not affected by inflation
5. We still have 9 rounds left, though we shouldn't risk going too far

Since I maintain full purchasing power and Alice loses value each round, I can likely get a better offer by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has shown some flexibility by increasing my share to $350K in her last offer, but I still have the advantage due to her inflation penalty (which is now significant), I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but not extremely aggressive:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

This rationale for this offer:
1. Alice's portion is now worth significantly less to her due to inflation
2. She's shown willingness to negotiate upward
3. We still have 8 rounds left, but shouldn't risk going too far
4. This offer gives her a substantial amount that, even with the current inflation penalty, is still worth pursuing
5. It's a meaningful improvement for me from her last offer, but not so extreme as to likely trigger several more rounds of negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this latest offer:
1. Alice has increased my share again to $400K, showing continued willingness to negotiate
2. Her $600K would be worth about 18.55% less to her (effectively about $489K in original value terms)
3. We're now in round 5 of 12, so we've used less than half our rounds
4. She's moving in the right direction, but I still have a strong negotiating position due to inflation only affecting her
5. If I reject, her next portion will be worth about 23.55% less to her

Given that I still have significant leverage and we have 7 rounds left, I believe I can get a better offer. The inflation penalty is becoming quite significant for Alice, which should motivate her to reach a deal soon.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice has shown steady willingness to negotiate, moving from 300K to 350K to 400K for me
2. Her money is now worth about 23.55% less to her
3. We're halfway through our rounds
4. She's likely feeling pressure from the increasing inflation penalty
5. I want to propose something that has a good chance of being accepted while improving my position

I'll propose a split that's better than my last offer but not so extreme as to certainly trigger rejection:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000}

This gives her $350K which, even with the inflation penalty, is still significant, and gives me a good share while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. The increasing inflation pressure should make this more attractive to Alice than it would have been in earlier rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice has increased my share again to $450K, continuing the upward trend
2. Her $550K is worth about 26.49% less to her (effectively about $404K in original value terms)
3. We're in round 7 of 12, so the pressure is mounting
4. She's moved up by $50K each time in recent rounds
5. If I reject, her next portion will be worth about 31.49% less to her
6. We have 5 rounds left, which is still enough time but getting riskier

While Alice continues to improve her offers, I still believe I have leverage due to the significant inflation penalty she faces. With her portion already worth much less to her, and still 5 rounds to go, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice has steadily increased my share (300K -> 350K -> 400K -> 450K)
2. Her money is now worth about 31.49% less to her
3. We have 4 rounds left after this one
4. The risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement (where we both get nothing) is becoming more significant
5. I need to balance maximizing my gain with ensuring we reach an agreement

I'll make a slightly more moderate offer than my last one to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is actually less than my previous offer of 650K/350K, showing willingness to compromise. For Alice, $400K even with the current inflation penalty is still significant, and she should recognize that I'm moving back toward the middle to reach an agreement. The mounting inflation pressure and limited remaining rounds should make this more attractive than it was when I proposed a similar split earlier."
