60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This gives you a solid $40 right away without risking inflation losses.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, since you took a larger share last round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This balances out the previous round and still gives you a good amount considering the game's progression.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation affecting me each round, I need a larger share to make up for lost value. The $75 I'm asking for is actually worth only $48 to me now due to two rounds of inflation. This is fair considering my diminishing returns.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor this round. This accounts for the value loss I've experienced and still offers you a reasonable amount. Let's find a balance before the money loses too much value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, the inflation is severely impacting me - even this $85 is only worth about $34.85 to me now due to the compounding 20% inflation each round. We need to reach an agreement soon before the money becomes worthless for both of us. This offer gives you $15 now, which is better than nothing if we keep going.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, with the money losing value rapidly, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor this round. This reflects the severe inflation impact on my side, and still leaves you with something before it's too late. We need to settle soon or we'll both end up with nothing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,accept
