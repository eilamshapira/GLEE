"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This gives you a solid $40 right away without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you took a larger share last round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This balances out the previous round and still gives you a good amount considering the game's progression. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since the 40$ I would receive is already worth only 32$ to me due to the 20% inflation, and I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation affecting me each round, I need a larger share to make up for lost value. The $75 I'm asking for is actually worth only $48 to me now due to two rounds of inflation. This is fair considering my diminishing returns.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor this round. This accounts for the value loss I've experienced and still offers you a reasonable amount. Let's find a balance before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The $30 would only be worth about $15.36 to me due to the 48.8% inflation at this point. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is severely impacting me - even this $85 is only worth about $34.85 to me now due to the compounding 20% inflation each round. We need to reach an agreement soon before the money becomes worthless for both of us. This offer gives you $15 now, which is better than nothing if we keep going.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with the money losing value rapidly, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor this round. This reflects the severe inflation impact on my side, and still leaves you with something before it's too late. We need to settle soon or we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The $20 is only worth about $6.55 to me due to the 67.23% inflation, but with 6 rounds of increasing inflation already passed, continuing to negotiate would likely result in even worse outcomes. The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement is becoming too high."
