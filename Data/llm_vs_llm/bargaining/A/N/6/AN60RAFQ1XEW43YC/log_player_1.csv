"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. Since Bob might be tempted to reject and counter-offer, I'll make a relatively fair initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This is a reasonable split giving Bob a good portion while still maintaining an advantage for myself. If Bob rejects, their next round's $100 will effectively be worth only $90 to them."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Bob offered me $54, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob takes $46, which is actually worth $41.40 to him due to 10% inflation
3. This is slightly less favorable to me than my initial offer
4. However, if I reject, we move to round 3 where Bob's money will be worth even less, which might make him less rational
5. The difference between my initial offer ($55) and this offer ($54) is minimal
6. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome rather than risking further rounds

Given this analysis, I'll accept the offer.
