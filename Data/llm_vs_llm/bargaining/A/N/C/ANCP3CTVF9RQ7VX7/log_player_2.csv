"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40%. If I reject and go to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation
2. I'll get to make the next proposal, but Alice could reject it
3. Original $4,000 would become worth $3,200 to me in the next round

While 40% is less than half, getting a guaranteed $4,000 now might be better than risking further devaluation through inflation. The 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
