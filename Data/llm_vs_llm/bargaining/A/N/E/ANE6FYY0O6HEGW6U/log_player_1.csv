Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the importance of fairness and time. With each passing round, my share loses value due to inflation. I’m proposing a 45-55 split now to ensure we both secure a deal immediately—this way, you still get a generous share while I avoid further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
