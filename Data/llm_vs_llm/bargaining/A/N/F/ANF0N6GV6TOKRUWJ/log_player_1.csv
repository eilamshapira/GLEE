"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair. Since the money loses value each round, we should both aim to get a good deal sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if we continue to the next round, the money will be worth another 20% less
2. The 45-55 split is relatively fair
3. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both parties due to the inflation penalty
4. Getting $45 now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a depreciated amount later"
