"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as he might still reject.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is advantageous to me but still gives Bob a substantial amount. Given the faster depreciation rate for Bob, this should be an attractive offer for him to consider rather than moving to the next round where his share would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With the current inflation rates:
- For me, $450,000 is now worth $427,500 (95% of original value)
- For Bob, $550,000 is now worth $495,000 (90% of original value)

2. If I reject:
- I can make a new offer next round
- But both our shares will be worth even less
- After several more rounds, the total value could decrease significantly

3. This is actually a reasonable offer:
- I get 45% of the total
- It's early in the game
- The difference in value isn't too extreme yet

Given that the money will continue to lose value for both of us (and more quickly for Bob), and this is a fair offer, I should accept.
