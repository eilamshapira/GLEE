"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer:
- Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($50 for each of us)
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, inflation will reduce the total value by 20% to $80
- Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total amount to divide will be less

This is a fair first offer that gives me half of the full amount. Given the inflation penalty, I would get less total money if I reject and try to negotiate further.
