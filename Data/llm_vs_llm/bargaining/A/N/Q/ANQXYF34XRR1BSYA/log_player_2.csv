"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm analyzing this offer from Alice. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $4,000 and her $6,000.

This is less than an equal split, but it's not an unreasonable opening offer. However, since this is just the first round of potentially 12 rounds, I have plenty of opportunity to make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me.

Given that I'll get to make the next proposal if I reject, and there's no penalty for going to the next round (as long as we eventually reach agreement), I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with an equal share, and it's the most equitable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we compromise? I'll take 5500 and you take 4500. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's new offer of a 55-45 split in her favor. She's moved from her initial 60-40 proposal to 55-45, offering me $4,500 instead of $4,000.

This is a step in the right direction and shows she's willing to compromise. However, since I proposed a perfectly fair 50-50 split and we still have many rounds left, I think there's room for her to move closer to an even division.
