"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. With a 10% inflation affecting me each round, an even split actually puts me at a disadvantage if we continue negotiating. This adjustment accounts for that inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
