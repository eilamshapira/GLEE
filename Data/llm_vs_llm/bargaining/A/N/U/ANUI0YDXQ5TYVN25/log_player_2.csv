Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. With a 10% inflation affecting me each round, an even split actually puts me at a disadvantage if we continue negotiating. This adjustment accounts for that inflation risk I'm facing.""}"
