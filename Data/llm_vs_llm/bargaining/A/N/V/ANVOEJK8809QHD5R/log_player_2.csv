"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the money equally: $50 for each of us. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Alice's offer as it is perfectly fair and equitable - an even 50-50 split gives both parties an equal share of the money. There's no reason to reject this reasonable proposal and risk getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds."
