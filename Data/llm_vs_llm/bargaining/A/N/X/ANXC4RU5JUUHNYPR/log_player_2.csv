"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Bob, and I need to consider the inflation. Let's analyze the offer.

*   Alice is offering me $50.
*   Money is worth 20% less to me each round.

Since this is Round 1, the $50 is worth $50 * (1 - 0 * 0.20) = $50 to me.

If I reject, I get to make an offer next round. However, my money will be worth 20% less in the next round. Therefore, to get $50 in value, I would need $50 / 0.8 = $62.50. Alice might not agree to my proposal, and in round 3 I would get even less.

Therefore, I should accept the offer.
