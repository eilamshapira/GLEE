"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking the lion's share. Accept this and we'll both walk away with something. Reject it, and things get more complicated. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

For Round 2, the value of the money for me is 80% of the original, and for Alice, it's 90% of the original.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value. This is a reasonable offer, don't let it slip away.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get the better end of the deal. This is my final offer before things get even tougher. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round (due to two rounds of 20% decrease: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, which is a 36% decrease), and Alice's offer gives me $400,000, the actual value I'd get is $400,000 * 0.64 = $256,000.

Given this, I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer.

For me, the money is now worth 48.8% less than the original (20% decrease in Round 1, another 20% decrease in Round 2, and another 20% decrease in Round 3: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, which is a 48.8% decrease). For Alice, the money is worth 27.1% less than the original (10% decrease in Round 1, another 10% decrease in Round 2, and another 10% decrease in Round 3: 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, which is a 27.1% decrease).

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""It's time for an equal split. The value is decreasing rapidly, and we both risk losing everything if we don't agree soon.""}"
