"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's favorable enough to me while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it to avoid value loss through inflation."
