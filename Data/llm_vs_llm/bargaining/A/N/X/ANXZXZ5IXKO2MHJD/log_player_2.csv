"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself. This isn't a perfectly equal split, but it's not too far off. If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 will be worth only $90 to me in the next round, which means even if I got it all (which Alice wouldn't accept), I'd effectively get less than the $45 offered now. Since this is a fairly reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty hurts me more than Alice, I should accept.
