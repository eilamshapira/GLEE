"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair proposal to share the $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives each of us an equal share of $500,000. This is the fairest way to divide the money, ensuring we both benefit equally."
