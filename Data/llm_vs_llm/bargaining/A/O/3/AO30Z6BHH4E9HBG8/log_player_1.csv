"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to think carefully about this offer. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement earlier rather than later. The money loses value more quickly for me (20% per round) than for Bob (5% per round), which gives Bob a slight advantage in later rounds.

For a first offer, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while being fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges we both need to come to an agreement soon due to the inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob made a very aggressive offer, taking over 83% of the money. Given the inflation rates, I need to be strategic but also make a more reasonable offer that might be accepted.

The money is now worth 40% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to round 1. We need to reach an agreement soon as the value continues to decrease, especially for me.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a larger share than my initial proposal, acknowledging the inflation disadvantage I face, while still seeking a more equitable distribution than Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1111 
# Bob gain: 8889 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob continues to make extremely imbalanced offers. Given that we're now in round 5, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, especially for me (the money is now worth 59.04% less for me and 18.55% less for Bob compared to round 1).

Let me propose a more pragmatic offer that accounts for our current inflation situation while still seeking a fairer division than Bob's proposals.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

I'm increasing Bob's share compared to my previous offer, recognizing both the inflation pressure and the need to reach an agreement soon, but still seeking a more balanced distribution than the extremely one-sided offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000
