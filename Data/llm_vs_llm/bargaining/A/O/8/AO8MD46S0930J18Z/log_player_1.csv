"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer considering the inflation effect I face. I want to be fair but also need to consider that the money will be worth less to me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this division because I know we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds, and inflation affects my gains by 5% each round. I'm offering you a substantial portion while still making sure my share is fair given the time pressure I face."
