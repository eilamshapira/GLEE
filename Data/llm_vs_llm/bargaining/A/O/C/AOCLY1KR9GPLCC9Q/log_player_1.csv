"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives me a good portion while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting, given his higher inflation penalty for waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $55, but with 5% inflation = $52.25
   * Bob gets $45, but with 10% inflation = $40.50

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (10% less for Bob, 5% less for me)
   * Given Bob's higher inflation rate, he might be more willing to accept my next offer
   * However, the total value we're splitting keeps decreasing

Given that this is a reasonable offer and the inflation penalty is already affecting both of us, I think it's best to accept now rather than risk further value deterioration.
