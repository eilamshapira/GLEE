"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the original $10,000, but considering the inflation, my offer will be based on the reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less, which means I'll effectively get $3500 * 0.64 = $2240.

Given this, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after 3 rounds (20% in round 1 and another 20% in round 2, and then considering the effect over two rounds, it's 20% + 20% + (20% * 0.8) = 36% less, but now it's 20% + 20% + 20% = 44.8% less for the next offer I make, but I will calculate based on 3 rounds of inflation for me: 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $5120), and the money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to make a more generous offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""alice_gain"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 59.04% less, which means I'll effectively get $2500 * 0.4096 = $1024.

Given this significant reduction in value, I'll have to reconsider my strategy.
