"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject this 50-50 split:

1. The money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
2. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. The current offer gives me $500,000, which is a fair split
4. If I wait, my $500,000 would become worth $400,000 due to inflation

Since this is a fair first offer and waiting would definitely reduce my value by 20%, I should accept this offer.
