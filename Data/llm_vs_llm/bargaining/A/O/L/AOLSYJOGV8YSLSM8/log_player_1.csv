"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5556, ""bob_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to maximize our mutual benefit given the 20% depreciation each round, I propose a division where I receive $5556 and you get $4444. Accepting now ensures we both get a fair share before further discounting takes effect. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the depreciation, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we can still secure a reasonable amount before the value drops further. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
