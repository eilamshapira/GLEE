Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to maximize our mutual benefit given the 20% depreciation each round, I propose a division where I receive $5556 and you get $4444. Accepting now ensures we both get a fair share before further discounting takes effect. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556
