"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we can both benefit more if we adjust our split! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 5500 * 0.95 = 5225 (due to 5% inflation)

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

For me, the money is worth 5% less in each round, so:
Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 95%
Round 3: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%

For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so:
Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 90%
Round 3: 90% * 0.9 = 81%

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation eats away more of our money!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a compromise that benefits us both! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation:
Alice gain: 5200 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = 4457.68 (due to 14.26% inflation)

For Bob, the offer is:
Bob gain: 4800 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 3499.2 (due to 27.1% inflation)

Considering the values, I think Bob's offer is relatively fair, and the inflation is starting to significantly reduce the value of the money. I'll accept the offer to avoid further losses.
