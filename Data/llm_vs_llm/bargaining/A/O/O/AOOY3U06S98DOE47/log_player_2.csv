"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 out of $100
* If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% next round
* $40 now is better than $42.10 next round (would need that much to offset 5% inflation)
* However, I could counter with a better offer next round
* We have plenty of rounds left
* 40/60 split seems a bit unfair in Alice's favor

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer to try negotiating a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but considering that Alice already showed she wants a substantial portion, I'll be strategic:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a more equitable division, slightly in my favor but not too aggressive. I'm offering Alice a reasonable $45 which is still a significant portion, while securing a better position for myself compared to her initial offer. This feels like a fair middle ground that could lead to an agreement before inflation erodes too much value."
