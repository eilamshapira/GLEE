"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split, where she gets $6000 and I get $4000.

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, if I reject this offer, the total pot's value to me would effectively be $9000 in the next round. If I were to propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $5000, but with 10% inflation, that's worth $4500 to me now - which is better than the current offer of $4000.

Even a 60-40 split in my favor next round would give me $6000, which after 10% inflation would be worth $5400 to me now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers both my interests and what might be acceptable to Alice.

Given the 10% inflation that affects me each round, I should try to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to future rounds. However, I also need to improve upon Alice's initial offer to make this worthwhile.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. You offered a 60-40 split in your favor, so I'm suggesting a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both deserve close to half, and further negotiation would reduce the total value due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this carefully:

Alice has offered me $4200, which is slightly better than her first offer of $4000.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where:
- My inflation penalty would increase to about 27% (from the current 19%)
- If I were to get a 50-50 split ($5000) in round 4, it would be worth about $3650 to me now after the 27% inflation
- Even if I got $6000 in the next round, it would be worth about $4380 with the 27% inflation

Although Alice's inflation penalty is higher than mine (36% vs 19%), she still seems willing to negotiate rather than concede more. Since the $4200 offer is close to what I might effectively get even with a better nominal split in the next round (due to increasing inflation), and this could go on for several more rounds with diminishing returns, I should accept this offer.
