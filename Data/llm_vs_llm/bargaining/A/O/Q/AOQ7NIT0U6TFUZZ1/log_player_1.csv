"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me since my inflation penalty is higher (10% vs your 5%). This is fair because waiting hurts me more than it hurts you. If we delay, we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer is better than proceeding to the next round.

If I accept Bob's offer of $50, its value to me is $50 × 0.9 = $45 (due to 10% inflation).

If I reject and make another offer in round 3, the maximum I could get would be further reduced by another 10%. Even if I proposed taking all $100 in round 3, it would be worth $100 × 0.9 × 0.9 = $81 to me, and Bob would likely reject it.

Since Bob's inflation rate is 5%, he has less incentive to resolve quickly, so I need to be pragmatic.
