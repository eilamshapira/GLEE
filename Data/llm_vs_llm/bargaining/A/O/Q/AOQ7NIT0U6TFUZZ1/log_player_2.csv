"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me since my inflation penalty is higher (10% vs your 5%). This is fair because waiting hurts me more than it hurts you. If we delay, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
