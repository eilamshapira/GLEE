Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your earlier proposal, but with the pressure of immediate devaluation, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is the most pragmatic solution. Accepting now secures us both a definitive outcome while protecting against further loss in value. Let's make this deal to avoid unnecessary inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
