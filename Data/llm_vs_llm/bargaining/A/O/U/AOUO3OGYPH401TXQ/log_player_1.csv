"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the impact of inflation on my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split with a slight advantage for me, since I know inflation will reduce the value of future payoffs for me by 20% each round. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation."
