"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. A 55/45 split for me seems fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
- I get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $40.5 to me
- Bob gets $55, worth full value to him

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- Any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- I need to consider if I can get enough more to offset the additional inflation loss

$40.5 now is probably better than risking another round of inflation. Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances.
