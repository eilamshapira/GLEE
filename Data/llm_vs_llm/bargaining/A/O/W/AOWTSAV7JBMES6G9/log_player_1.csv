"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my money is worth less now. I need to think carefully.

My original offer gave me $60. With 20% inflation, the money is now worth less, and I also only have a limited number of rounds left. Bob is offering me $45.

I choose to accept this offer.
