6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for us both to take something now.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, since we're already losing 5% of the total value, I suggest a more equitable split of 52/48. This gives you 4800$ now, which is better than what you'd likely get if we continue negotiating and letting inflation reduce our total. Let's not lose more value - this is fair for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - we both lose if this drags on. 55/45 is my final offer.",Alice,3,
