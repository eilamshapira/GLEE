Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since we're already losing 5% of the total value, I suggest a more equitable split of 52/48. This gives you 4800$ now, which is better than what you'd likely get if we continue negotiating and letting inflation reduce our total. Let's not lose more value - this is fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
