"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for us both to take something now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's proposal carefully. She's offered me 4000$ out of the 10,000$, which is a 60/40 split in her favor.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total amount will be reduced by 5% to 9,500$. That means even if I proposed a fair 50/50 split next round, I would get 4,750$ - which is better than the 4,000$ I'm being offered now.

Since I can potentially get a better deal by going to the next round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that's better for both of us than continuing to let the money decrease in value.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, since we're already losing 5% of the total value, I suggest a more equitable split of 52/48. This gives you 4800$ now, which is better than what you'd likely get if we continue negotiating and letting inflation reduce our total. Let's not lose more value - this is fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - we both lose if this drags on. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully. 

Alice is now offering me 4500$ out of the 10,000$. However, due to inflation, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. This means the real value of this offer is about 4,061.25$ (4500 Ã— 0.9025).

If I reject this offer, in the next round the money will be worth 14.75% less than the original value. Even if I could get a 50/50 split (5000$) in the next round, it would be worth about 4,262.5$ in original value.

The marginal gain for continuing is getting smaller, and there's risk Alice could make an even less favorable offer in future rounds. While her current offer isn't ideal, it's reasonable given the inflation penalty, and we should avoid further devaluation.
