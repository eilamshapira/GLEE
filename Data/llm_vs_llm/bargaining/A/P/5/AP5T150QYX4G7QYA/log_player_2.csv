"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The money is worth 5% less to me (I'd have $9,500 equivalent to work with)
   * The money is worth 20% less to Alice (much more significant drop)
   * I get to make the next proposal

Given that Alice faces a much steeper depreciation (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage for the next round. I could propose a better split for myself, and she would be more likely to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money has depreciated (worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice), I should propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being acceptable to Alice, considering she faces a steeper depreciation in the next round.
