"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly higher split in my favor since Bob doesn't face inflation penalties, but still fair enough to be attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split considering I face inflation penalties in future rounds while Bob doesn't."
