Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before inflation makes the potential gains less appealing. Bob's rejection of my first offer and his attempt to take a larger share in round 2 suggest he might be prone to risk. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for him to accept, knowing that further delays might result in even smaller gains for him."
