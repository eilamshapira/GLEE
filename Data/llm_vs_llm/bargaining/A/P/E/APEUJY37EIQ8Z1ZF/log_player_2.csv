"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally, so we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject this offer:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
2. I'll get to make a counter-proposal
3. But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

A 50-50 split is actually quite fair, and if I reject it, I'm guaranteed to lose 10% of the value. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further losses.
