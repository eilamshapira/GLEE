"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. Since there's no inflation affecting me, I can negotiate without pressure, but I'm offering an equal split because it's the most equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
