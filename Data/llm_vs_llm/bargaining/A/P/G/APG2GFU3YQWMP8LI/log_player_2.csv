"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in the first round! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% inflation rate per round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. I could potentially secure a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. Since there's no inflation affecting me, I can negotiate without pressure, but I'm offering an equal split because it's the most equitable solution.""}"
