"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think through this carefully:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500 total value for me
   * I'd need to get significantly more than $4000 to make up for the loss

The current offer gives me 40% of the pot. While not ideal, rejecting means I need to get at least $4,210 ($4000/0.95) in the next round just to break even. Given that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, it's risky to reject.
