"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 36, ""bob_gain"": 64, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my offer for a timely agreement: I’ll take $36 and you get $64 out of the $100. Given that money loses value as rounds go by—with my share decaying by 20% each round and yours by 10%—I believe this division reflects our differing patience and is in both our best interests. Let's settle now and avoid the further discounting of value. What do you think?""}"
