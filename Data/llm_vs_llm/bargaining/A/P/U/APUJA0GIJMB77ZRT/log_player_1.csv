"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for the first round. Given that I value the money consistently across all rounds while Bob might have his own inflation concerns, I'll propose a relatively fair split that acknowledges the advantage of moving first.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable division that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still offers Bob a substantial portion. I believe this is fair and hope Bob will accept so we can both walk away with significant amounts rather than risking further rounds of negotiation."
