"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair division while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still fair enough to be acceptable. If Bob rejects and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 5% less, so I need to account for that risk in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $4500, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $4275 to me
- If I reject: We go to round 3, where any money I get will be worth 10% less than original value
- If I make a new offer in round 3, Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation penalties for me

While Bob's offer gives him more than half, accepting now is better than risking further inflation penalties. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
