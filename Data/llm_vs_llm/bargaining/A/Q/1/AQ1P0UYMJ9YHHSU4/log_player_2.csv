"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

I should keep in mind that with each passing round, inflation reduces the value of money - 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice per round. If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the total value will be less for both of us.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the $100 would be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split in round 2, I'd get $45 (worth $40.5 to me after inflation), and Alice might reject that.

While $40 isn't an equal split, considering the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiation, it's a reasonable offer.
