Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation and our future prospects, this split secures you the same real value you'd expect if you waited to propose next round. Let’s settle now—fair and efficient for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
