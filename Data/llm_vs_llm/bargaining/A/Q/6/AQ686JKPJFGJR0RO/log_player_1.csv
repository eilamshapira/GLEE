"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55-45, which gives both of us a significant portion of the money. Given that inflation affects me more heavily (10% per round versus Bob's 5%), it makes sense to reach an agreement early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6454 
# Bob gain: 3546 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a very favorable split for me, giving me 64.54% of the total amount. Considering inflation will reduce my gains by 10% each round, accepting this favorable offer now is better than risking further negotiation where inflation will diminish the value more significantly."
