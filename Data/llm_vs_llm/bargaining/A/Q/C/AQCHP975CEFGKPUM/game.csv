3571.43,6428.57,"Hi Bob, in Round 1 I propose that I receive $3571.43 while you receive $6428.57. This split reflects our differing discount rates (my money losing 20% per round and yours 10%), and I believe itâ€™s a fair division for both of us if we agree now. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,
