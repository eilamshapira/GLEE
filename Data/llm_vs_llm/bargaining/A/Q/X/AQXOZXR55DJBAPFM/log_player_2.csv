"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slight advantage for me since the inflation affects you more severely than me. This way we both walk away with a fair amount considering our different inflation rates.

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you slightly more than last time. Given the high inflation rate you face (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair split considering our different positions. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her last one, and still significantly favors Alice. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to aim for a more equitable split."
