"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $4,500, keeping $5,500 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I can make a counteroffer
- The money will be worth 20% less to Alice (but same for me)
- Alice's $5,500 would effectively become worth $4,400 to her in the next round

This means I have leverage in the next round since Alice faces devaluation while I don't. I could potentially offer a deal that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the time pressure she faces.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for better terms.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I know Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage. In this round, $10,000 is still worth full value to me but only worth 80% to Alice.

I'll propose a split that gives me a larger share while still being rational for Alice to accept (since rejecting would mean even less value for her in the next round).

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $4,000 now is worth more than potentially getting more in the next round when it will be devalued by another 20%
2. It's still a significant amount that respects Alice as a negotiating partner
3. If Alice rejects, in the next round the entire sum will be worth even less to her, making this a relatively attractive offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5,200, which is better than her initial offer of $4,500
2. For Alice, the $4,800 is actually worth only $3,072 (64% of $4,800) due to the 36% inflation she's experiencing
3. If I reject:
   - We go to next round where I can make an offer
   - Alice will face 48% inflation (another 20% drop)
   - I still face no inflation
   - But we're getting deeper into negotiations which might risk the deal altogether

This is actually a pretty good offer for me:
- I get more than half ($5,200)
- Alice has already conceded significantly from her initial position
- The amount is substantial enough that continuing to negotiate might be risky

I'll accept this offer.
