"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. How about I take 600,000 and you take 400,000?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's do a fair 50-50 split. Since your money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5%), accepting now would be better than waiting for future rounds where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
