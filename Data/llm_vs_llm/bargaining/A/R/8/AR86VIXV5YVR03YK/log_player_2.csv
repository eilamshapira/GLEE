"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. How about I take 600000 and you take 400000? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 5% less
2. Alice's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round)
3. We have a limited number of rounds before we both get nothing

Given that Alice's money depreciates faster, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. The 5% depreciation would make my $400,000 worth $380,000, but I could propose a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I'll propose a more balanced split while highlighting this dynamic.
