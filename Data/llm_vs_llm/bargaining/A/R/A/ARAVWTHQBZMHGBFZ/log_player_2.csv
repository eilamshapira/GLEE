"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 equallyâ€”$5000 for you and $5000 for me. Since each additional round reduces my share by 5%, it makes sense for both of us to agree now rather than delay and lose value. I believe this fair division is our best option given the circumstances. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is to split the $10,000 equally, which seems like a fair proposal, and considering the inflation factor that reduces the value with each round, it makes sense to accept this offer to avoid potential losses due to inflation.
