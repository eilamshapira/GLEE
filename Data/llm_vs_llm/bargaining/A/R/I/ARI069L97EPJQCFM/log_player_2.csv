"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this fairly today. Since my portion loses 5% value with each round, I'm offering you $520000 and taking $480000, ensuring you get a slightly better deal if you accept right away. Let's avoid delays and secure this agreement immediately! 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems fair, considering the 5% inflation per round that affects my portion. By accepting now, I avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in future rounds. Since I'm being offered more than half of the total amount ($520,000) and we'd settle this immediately, it makes economic sense to accept.
