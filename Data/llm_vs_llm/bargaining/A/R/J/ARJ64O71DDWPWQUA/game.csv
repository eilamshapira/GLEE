6000.0,4000.0,Hi Bob! Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 6000 and you get 4000. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initiative. I'd like to propose a 50-50 split, ensuring fairness for both of us. Let's agree now and avoid any further delays.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, I understand you want fairness. Given the inflation, I'm now offering 5500 for me and 4500 for you. Take it or leave it!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, considering that every additional round further erodes the value of your share, I'm putting forward a proposal that lets you lock in a better outcome than risking more inflation. I propose I receive 5200 and you receive 4800. This way, you avoid future devaluation and we both get a conclusive deal. I hope you'll agree to settle now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alright Bob, your strategy seems to be working. Given the inflation and your previous offer, I propose 5200 for me, and 4800 for you. This is my final offer, so let's finalize this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Hi Alice, I know we’ve both felt the sting of inflation so far—and yours, in particular, has been taking a heavier toll. Waiting further will only worsen the effective value of your share. I'm offering you 4600 (nominal) dollars now, which, despite the numbers, is a secure deal compared to the uncertain and likely lower outcome if we delay even more. I believe this strike of balance protects both our interests. Let's settle this round and avoid further erosion.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's try a straight 50/50 split. Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take 5000, you take 5000. It's fair and simple.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4400.0,5600.0,"Hi Alice, as we move into round 8, the impact of inflation on your share is getting even heavier. I’m offering you 4400 while I take 5600. Although the numbers might seem skewed, waiting further could worsen the effective value of your portion even more. This is a practical offer to secure both our interests—please consider accepting it before the situation deteriorates further.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, let's settle this. Given the inflation, I will receive 4800, and you will receive 5200. Consider it a final offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, as we reach round 10, the effective value of your share is deteriorating even further due to inflation. I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. While the nominal numbers might look less balanced, please consider that any further delay will likely leave your share worth even less in real terms. Let's finalize this now and avoid more loss.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alright Bob, this is it. I'll take 4500, you take 5500. Let's finish this game.",Alice,11,
