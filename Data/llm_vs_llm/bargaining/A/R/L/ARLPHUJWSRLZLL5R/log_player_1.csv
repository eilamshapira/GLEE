"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good portion, but slightly favoring me since I'm making the first move. I'll offer a 60-40 split.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. While it's similar to my initial proposal but reversed, I need to consider that due to inflation, $40 is now worth only $32 to me. I'd rather make a counter-offer in the next round, even though it will be subject to further inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider that any amount I receive will be worth 40% less than in round 1 due to inflation. To compensate for this loss, I'll propose a higher split in my favor while still keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
- However, due to inflation, my $50 would actually be worth only $25.60 to me (51.2% of $50)
- If I reject, we move to round 5 where any amount I receive will be worth even less
- We've already used 4 rounds out of 12, and the pattern suggests reaching an agreement might take several more rounds
- Each additional round makes my potential gains worth less

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, continuing to negotiate would likely result in even lower real value for me due to inflation.
