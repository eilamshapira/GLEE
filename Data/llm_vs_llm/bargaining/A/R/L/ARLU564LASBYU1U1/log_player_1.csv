"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 for myself and give $45 to Bob. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial share, while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $38 to me
- If I reject and make another offer in the next round, any money will be worth even less (10% less than original)
- However, Bob is offering himself $60 while apparently suffering from 20% inflation (making his $60 worth only $48 to him)
- I could potentially make a better offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as I believe I can make a more balanced proposal in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, I need to account for the fact that any money I get is now worth 10% less than the original value. I should make an attractive offer to Bob to avoid further depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing this split because:
1. My $52 is actually worth $46.8 to me after 10% inflation
2. We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss
3. This is a more balanced offer that Bob might accept, especially since his previous offer was rejected"
