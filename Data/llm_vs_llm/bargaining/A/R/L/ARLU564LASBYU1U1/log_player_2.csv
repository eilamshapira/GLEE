"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is 100 * 0.8 = $80.
To maximize my gain, I'll make a proposal where I get a bit more than half of the original $100, considering the reduced value.
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $48 I would gain is actually worth 48 * 0.64 = $30.72 to me (since it's 36% less than the original value).
On the other hand, if I were to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the value of the money would decrease even further for me.
Given this, Alice's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.
