"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split 60/40. It's a fair start, considering we both benefit from moving quickly due to inflation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, here's my proposal: I take $7,143 and you get $2,857. This split adjusts for our differing inflation rates—since your money loses value faster than mine, the equilibrium favors me a bit. Accepting now ensures you secure the best possible outcome given the devaluation if we proceed further. I look forward to your agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, it seems like we're facing a tough negotiation. With inflation kicking in, it makes sense for us both to aim for an equitable split of $5000 each in this round. This division is fair and helps us both minimize further losses. Let's wrap this up in harmony! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, here’s my proposal for round 4. Given the inflation rate, my share is now 2000 and yours 8000. With round 4 multipliers (0.729 for me and 0.512 for you), this means you’d effectively secure about 4096 dollars if you accept now. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose in round 5, but your money will only be worth 0.8 × 0.64 = 0.512 of its original value, leaving you with at most the same effective amount—or even less once I consider your need to give me a bare minimum. Therefore, accepting this offer preserves your best possible outcome under the escalating devaluation. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"
