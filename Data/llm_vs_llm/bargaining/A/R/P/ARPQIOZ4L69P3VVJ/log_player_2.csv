"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me
3. A fair split might seem reasonable, but since I have the inflation disadvantage, I might want to ask for more
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. With inflation, my $500,000 would be worth $450,000 in the next round if I try to get the same amount

However, this is a solid first offer, and there's risk in rejection. If negotiations drag on, inflation will significantly eat into my share, and we might end up with nothing after 12 rounds.
