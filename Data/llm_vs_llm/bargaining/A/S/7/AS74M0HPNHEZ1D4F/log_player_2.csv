"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. This is a 60-40 split in her favor.

I should consider that:
1. For each round that passes, Alice's value decreases by 20% while mine stays the same
2. We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing
3. I could counter-offer in the next round
4. The longer we negotiate, the worse position Alice is in due to the 20% depreciation

Given that Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round (so her $600k would only be worth $480k to her), I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money value decreases by 20% each round, I should leverage this to get a better deal. However, I also don't want to be too aggressive and risk prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.

Given that Alice's value has already decreased by 20%, a fair split now would actually give me more than 50%. I'll propose a 70-30 split in my favor, which considering her 20% depreciation, is actually more balanced from her perspective than it appears.

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Given the 20% depreciation on your side, this offer is actually fair. Your $300k now is worth more than $400k next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering depreciation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (up from her initial $400,000)
2. She would get $550,000, but it's worth 36% less to her than in round 1
3. $550,000 with 36% depreciation is worth about $352,000 to her
4. If I reject, her next value will depreciate by 48.8% (next round)
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but prolonging too much risks getting nothing

This is a significant improvement from her first offer. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate (as her value continues to depreciate), there's also a risk of deadlock. This offer gives me a good portion while still being reasonable to Alice given the depreciation she's experiencing.
