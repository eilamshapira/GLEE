"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting Alice and Bob. Since I experience higher inflation (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a favorable first offer while still being reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me 60% of the total amount while leaving Bob with a substantial 40%. Given that my money will depreciate faster than Bob's if we continue to the next round, this is a fair initial proposal that acknowledges both parties' interests."
