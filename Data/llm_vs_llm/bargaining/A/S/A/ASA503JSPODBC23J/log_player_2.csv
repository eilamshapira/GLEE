"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Only 5% less to Alice
   - The total value for me in next round would be maximum $800,000 Ã— 0.8 = $640,000

While I could potentially get more in the next round, the steep 20% inflation penalty for me compared to Alice's 5% makes this a risky move. The current offer of $400,000 is substantial, and the risk of losing value through inflation might not be worth it.
