"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation effect. With each passing round, my value of the money decreases by 20%, but for Bob, there's no inflation. If I go to the next round, I'll only get 80% of the value.

Let me make a fair and reasonable offer to maximize my gain while giving Bob a decent amount.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, Bob. This is a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to secure a reasonable amount. Given that I face 20% inflation if we go to the next round, I hope you'll find this acceptable so we can both walk away with a good result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation effect.

Bob is offering me $45. Due to inflation, this is equivalent to 45 * 0.8 = $36 in original value for me, while Bob would get $55 at full value.

If I reject and make an offer in round 3, I'll face another 20% inflation (meaning round 3 money would be worth 64% of original value to me). If Bob then rejects my round 3 offer, we'd go to round 4 where the money would be worth even less to me (51.2% of original value).

Given these circumstances, accepting Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $36 to me after inflation) seems reasonable. If I reject, I'd need to get substantially more in the next round to offset the additional inflation.
