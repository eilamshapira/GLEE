"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me 40$ out of 100$, keeping 60$ for herself. If I reject:
- I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- The money will maintain its full value for me (0% loss)
- But it will be worth 20% less to Alice

Given that Alice's portion would be worth 20% less next round, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. She would only get 80% value of whatever amount we agree on next round. This makes her more likely to accept a more favorable split for me.

I'll reject this offer and propose a better split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll consider that:
1. The money maintains full value for me
2. For Alice, any amount will be worth 20% less than in round 1
3. Alice needs to find this offer more attractive than making a counter-offer where values would decrease further for her

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more favorable to me than the original offer, but still gives Alice a decent amount that's worth taking now rather than waiting for another round where she'll lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. Given the 20% depreciation for her, she should prefer taking $45 now rather than waiting for another round where any amount would be worth even less to her."
