"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I get 5500 and you get 4500? This seems more balanced considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
