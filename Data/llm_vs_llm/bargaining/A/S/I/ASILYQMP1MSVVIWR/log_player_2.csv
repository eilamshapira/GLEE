"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, I need to remember that if I reject and we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value of my money by 20%. So in the next round, the $100 would only be worth $80 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I proposed getting $60 (and Alice getting $40), that $60 would only be worth $48 to me due to inflation. This makes Alice's current offer of $40 quite reasonable given the inflation penalty.
