Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 57.5%-42.5% split in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing. This way, considering inflation, I'm actually getting close to the same value you offered originally, while you still get a substantial portion. 
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{
