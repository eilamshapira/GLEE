"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. While an even split seems fair, I could potentially get more if I make a counteroffer in the next round. However, with 5% inflation per round, waiting reduces the value of my share.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me will be 9,500. If I then proposed something like 6,000 for me and 4,000 for Alice, I'd get 6,000 - which is better than the current 5,000 offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 5% less to me (so the $10,000 is effectively worth $9,500 to me), I should propose a split that accounts for this inflation while still remaining attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5750, 
""alice_gain"": 4250, 
""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 57.5%-42.5% split in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing. This way, considering inflation, I'm actually getting close to the same value you offered originally, while you still get a substantial portion.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering your inflation concerns, I'm offering you a bit more than half, but I also need to ensure I get a fair share. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully, considering the inflation effect.

The original $10,000 is now worth 9.75% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total value to me is $9,025. Alice is offering me $5,500 of that, which is more than half.

If I reject and we continue to the next round, I'll face even greater inflation (around 14.75% by round 4), further reducing the value of any future gains. Alice has increased her offer to account for my inflation penalty, which suggests she's negotiating in good faith.

$5,500 now is better than risking further inflation for a potentially marginally better offer later.
