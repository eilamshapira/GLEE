Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is better for you than waiting, as your money loses 20% value each round. If we go to round 3, you'd need to offer me more than 50% for me to accept, given the inflation effect on your side. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
