"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I get a slight advantage now due to the inflation for me, but you still get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer given the inflation factor.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. For me, there's no inflation penalty, so that's exactly $400,000 in value. For Alice, the money loses 20% value each round, but this is round 1, so there's no loss yet - she gets the full $600,000 in value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it too, and we'd go to round 3. By then, Alice's money would be worth 20% less, giving me some negotiating advantage. However, there's also the risk of continuing too long and both getting nothing.

Since I have the inflation advantage in later rounds, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a more balanced split that still accounts for the inflation asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is better for you than waiting, as your money loses 20% value each round. If we go to round 3, you'd need to offer me more than 50% for me to accept, given the inflation effect on your side.""}"
