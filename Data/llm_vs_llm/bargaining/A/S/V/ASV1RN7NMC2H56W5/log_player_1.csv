"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Given that Bob and I need to divide $1,000,000, and we both want to maximize our gains, I'll propose an even split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the total amount, which I believe gives us both an equal and substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is looking for a larger share than 50-50. Since inflation affects Bob's gains by 20% each round, I'll make an offer that accounts for this while still being favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than my initial proposal, acknowledging his time pressure from inflation, while still securing a substantial amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is continuing to ask for more despite facing significant inflation. Since Bob is now experiencing almost 50% inflation compared to round 1, his bargaining position is weakening. I'll adjust my offer slightly to acknowledge this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This offer gives me a bit more than half, which is reasonable given that Bob's money is rapidly losing value with each round, increasing his urgency to make a deal."
