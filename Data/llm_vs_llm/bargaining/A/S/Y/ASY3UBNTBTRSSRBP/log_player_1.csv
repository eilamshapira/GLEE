"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds. Since I want to encourage Bob to accept early, I'll offer a slightly favorable deal for him.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'll let Bob know: ""I propose that you get $550,000 and I get $450,000. This is a favorable split for you, and accepting now means we both avoid inflation losses."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $400,000 to me
* If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth even less
* Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but due to different inflation rates, it's actually less favorable for me
* However, continuing to negotiate means more value lost to inflation

Given that inflation will keep eating into the value and we have limited rounds, I'll accept this offer.
