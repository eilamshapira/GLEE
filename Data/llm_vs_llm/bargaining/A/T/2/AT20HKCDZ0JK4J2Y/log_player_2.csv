"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, we both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Money will be worth 20% less next round (total value = $800,000)
   * I can make the next offer
   * Maximum I could get next round would be less than $450,000 due to inflation
   * Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further losses

Alice's argument about being first mover isn't really valid, but the threat of inflation makes this a reasonable offer. If I reject, we both lose value, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round.
