"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $10 and she gets $90. This is significantly in my disfavor.

I should consider that with each round, Alice faces a 20% depreciation in value while I face no depreciation (0%). This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds, as waiting is more costly for Alice than for me.

Given this significant asymmetry in our time preferences and the very uneven split being offered, I'll reject this proposal and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different time discounting factors. Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round while I face none, a more balanced division would be appropriate, with a slight advantage to me given my stronger negotiating position.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that the money maintains full value for me over time, while it loses value for Alice with each round. If we continue negotiating, Alice's potential gain will decrease due to her time discount factor, so accepting this offer now is beneficial for her compared to prolonged negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this updated offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $28 and keeping $72. While this is an improvement from her first offer of $10/$90, it's still significantly in my favor to reject this.

Let's consider our positions:
- For me, the money maintains full value throughout all rounds
- For Alice, the money has already depreciated by 36%, and will continue to depreciate by 20% each round
- We're only in round 3 of a potential 12 rounds
- The longer we negotiate, the stronger my position becomes

Given these factors, Alice's offer still doesn't reflect our asymmetric time preferences adequately. I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer that considers our different discount factors. As we progress through rounds, Alice's position weakens more than mine since the money depreciates for her but not for me.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This is reasonable considering that we're now in round 4, and Alice faces a significant depreciation (already at 36% and growing with each round). If we continue negotiating further, Alice stands to lose more due to her time discount factor.

This offer is an improvement for Alice compared to extended negotiations, where her potential gain would continue to decrease in real value. I'm increasing my share slightly from my previous offer to reflect the strengthening of my position as rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this updated offer.

Alice is now offering me $36 while keeping $64. Let's analyze our positions:

- For me, the money maintains full value
- For Alice, the money has now depreciated by 59.04% (meaning her $64 is effectively worth only about $26.21 of original value)
- We're in round 5 of 12 possible rounds
- Alice's money will continue to depreciate by 20% each round
- My negotiating position continues to strengthen with each round

While Alice has improved her offer, it still doesn't adequately reflect our vastly different time preferences. Given that we still have 7 more potential rounds and Alice's money will continue to rapidly lose value, I believe I can achieve a better outcome by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that reflects our increasingly divergent positions due to the asymmetric depreciation factors.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This reflects the reality of our situation in round 6:

- We're halfway through our possible 12 rounds
- Alice's money has already depreciated by nearly 60% 
- Each additional round represents a substantial loss in value for Alice but no loss for me
- If negotiations continue to the later rounds, Alice's position will become dramatically weaker

This offer provides Alice with $30, which given her current depreciation rate, is a better outcome than she would likely achieve through continued negotiation. The longer we delay agreement, the less Alice will effectively receive in terms of real value, while my position remains unchanged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $42 while keeping $58. Let's analyze our current positions:

- For me, the money maintains full value
- For Alice, the money has now depreciated by 73.79% (meaning her $58 is effectively worth only about $15.20 of original value)
- We're in round 7 of 12 possible rounds
- Alice's money will continue to depreciate by 20% each round
- My negotiating position has strengthened significantly

While Alice has improved her offer to $42 for me, given the extreme depreciation she's facing and that we still have 5 more potential rounds, this offer doesn't adequately reflect our positions. Her $58 has already lost nearly three-quarters of its value to her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that reflects our increasingly asymmetric positions as we approach the final rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This reflects our current situation in round 8:

- We've now used 8 of our possible 12 rounds
- Alice's money has depreciated by over 73% already
- Each additional round represents a substantial further loss in value for Alice (20% more each round)
- If we continue to the final rounds, Alice's potential gain would be worth very little to her

This offer provides Alice with $25, which - despite seeming small - actually represents a better real value for her than continuing negotiations and facing further depreciation. At this point, securing any agreement soon is significantly in Alice's interest due to the severe time pressure she faces.

If we fail to reach an agreement by round 12, we both get nothing, so this offer represents a reasonable compromise given our vastly different time preferences."
