"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face a 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round. This is a fair offer that saves us both time and gives you a substantial amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's wrap this up quickly. I understand you're facing inflation, so I'm proposing a split that's a bit more in your favor than my previous offer. This seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

Since we're in round 2, the money I receive is worth 20% less to me. So $5200 in this round is equivalent to $5200 Ã— 0.8 = $4160 in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, I'll face another 20% inflation penalty. Also, Bob is offering me more than half of the money ($5200 vs $4800 for him), which seems reasonable given the circumstances.
