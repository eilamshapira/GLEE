"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Only 5% less to Alice
   - She might reject my offer anyway

While 4000$ isn't the most favorable split, the asymmetric inflation puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds. Each round I wait, my negotiating position gets worse. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
