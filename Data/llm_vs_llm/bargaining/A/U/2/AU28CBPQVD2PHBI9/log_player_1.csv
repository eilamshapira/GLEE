"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I need to factor that into my decision. Let's calculate:

*   **My original gain (Round 1):** $60, which effectively becomes $60 * 0.80 = $48 in terms of Round 2 value.
*   **Bob's gain (Round 1):** $40, which we don't need to calculate since it's not relevant for my gain.

I'll evaluate the current offer based on the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Here's the breakdown and my decision:

*   **Alice's Gain (Round 2):** $50
*   **Acceptance Decision:** Based on these numbers, I will accept this offer.
