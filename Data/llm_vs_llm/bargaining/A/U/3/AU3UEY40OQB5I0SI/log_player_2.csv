Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration. 

For round 2, the total value of the money for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.80 = $8,000.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500}"
