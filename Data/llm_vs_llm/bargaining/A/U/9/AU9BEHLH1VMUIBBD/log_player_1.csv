"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces 10% inflation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you $4,000, which is more valuable than getting a larger amount in later rounds due to your 10% inflation penalty. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you $5500 because I believe a slightly more equitable split will be fair for both of us, especially considering the inflation factor on my side. Let's conclude the deal on these terms. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $5500, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob gets $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4050 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But Bob will face another 10% inflation
   - Making him more likely to accept a lower amount
4. Therefore, strategically, I should reject this offer as I can likely get a better deal next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob is now facing 20% total inflation in this round, I can make a stronger offer in my favor while still making it attractive for Bob to accept rather than risk further inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation you're facing, this $3,500 is worth only $2,800 to you now. If you reject, your next offer will face 30% inflation, making any future gains worth even less. This is your best option at this point.""}"
