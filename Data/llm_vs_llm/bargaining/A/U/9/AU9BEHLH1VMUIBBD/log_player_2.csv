"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you $4000, which is more valuable than getting a larger amount in later rounds due to your 10% inflation penalty. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm offering you $5500 because I believe a slightly more equitable split will be fair for both of us, especially considering the inflation factor on my side. Let's conclude the deal on these terms.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation you're facing, this $3500 is worth only $2800 to you now. If you reject, your next offer will face 30% inflation, making any future gains worth even less. This is your best option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
