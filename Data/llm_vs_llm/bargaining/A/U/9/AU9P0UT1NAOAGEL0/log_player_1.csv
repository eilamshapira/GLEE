Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the need for a swift resolution to avoid any unforeseen devaluation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise that rewards both of us for a prompt agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we've both been trying to secure our best outcomes, but further delay only risks more value lost on your side. In round 3 you proposed a 45/55 split, which—given the current inflation—gives you an effective value that you can’t really improve on by waiting. I'm proposing the same 45 for me and 55 for you. Accepting this now spares us both the risk of further devaluation. I believe it's our best move toward a fair and final agreement. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though it's the same split I offered, accepting now prevents further loss in value due to inflation on my end. Bob is clearly trying to stall and benefit from the decreasing value on my side.  It's better to secure the 55 now than risk getting even less in later rounds."
