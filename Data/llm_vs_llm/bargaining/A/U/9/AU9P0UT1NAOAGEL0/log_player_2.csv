"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the need for a swift resolution to avoid any unforeseen devaluation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise that rewards both of us for a prompt agreement. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and this back and forth isn't helping. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we've both been trying to secure our best outcomes, but further delay only risks more value lost on your side. In round 3 you proposed a 45/55 split, which—given the current inflation—gives you an effective value that you can’t really improve on by waiting. I'm proposing the same 45 for me and 55 for you. Accepting this now spares us both the risk of further devaluation. I believe it's our best move toward a fair and final agreement.""}"
