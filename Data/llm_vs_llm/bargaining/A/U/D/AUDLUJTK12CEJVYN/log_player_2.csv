"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair offer, considering that I am taking the larger share. However, I hope you see the value in accepting a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, keeping $800,000 for herself. While $200,000 is a significant amount, this is a heavily skewed split (20-80).

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. Given that we're both rational players, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. There's no immediate pressure to accept such an uneven split, and I can propose a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while still being strategic.

""message"": ""I propose an equal split, which is the fairest outcome for both of us. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount and neither feels disadvantaged.""
