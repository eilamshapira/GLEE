"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that I (Alice) am affected by 5% inflation each round while Bob isn't. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering I need to protect against potential inflation losses in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too favorable to Bob. Since I am affected by inflation and he isn't, he's trying to take advantage of that. I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round, although I'll need to consider that the money will be worth even less for me then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 3 and my gains are subject to 10% total inflation (5% compounded twice), I need to be strategic while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm slightly lowering my initial demand to show willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a position that protects me from inflation effects. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal while still being fair to me considering the inflation penalty I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure on my side. With the 14.26% inflation penalty, my $3800 would actually be worth only about $3258 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $6200 maintains full value. That's too unbalanced. 

While rejecting does mean facing even more inflation in the next round, I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement, and I'll have the chance to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 5 and the inflation effect is becoming more significant, I need to adjust my strategy while still seeking a fair deal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal split now to demonstrate maximum fairness and hopefully reach an agreement. Even though this 50-50 split will be worth less to me due to inflation, it's better to reach a deal now than to continue negotiating with increasing inflation penalties. This offer shows I'm willing to meet in the middle, and it's a very reasonable proposition that would be hard for Bob to justify rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal for me, the mounting inflation pressure makes continuing to negotiate risky. With the current 22.62% inflation penalty, my $3600 is worth about $2786 in round 1 terms, and if I reject, the next round will reduce my purchasing power even further. Also, we're halfway through our 12 rounds, and the risk of not reaching an agreement at all (resulting in zero for both) is becoming more concerning. While Bob has been aggressive in negotiating, getting something is better than risking further inflation or total failure."
