"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair and straightforward first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is asking for more than a 50-50 split, which suggests he may be affected by inflation and wants to compensate for that. Let me make a slightly more favorable offer to him while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I propose a 48-52 split, which gives Bob a bit more to account for the inflation he's experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is requesting an increasingly larger share, likely to compensate for the growing inflation effect on his end. I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to him while still ensuring I get a reasonable portion.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose a 45-55 split, giving Bob a larger share to help offset the inflation he's experiencing while maintaining a fair outcome for both of us."
