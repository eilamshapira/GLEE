"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, considering the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my money is now worth less. Bob's offer is not ideal, but I need to consider my potential gains in the next round. If I reject, I will make an offer and have to account for another 5% inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
