"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is much fairer than the previous 20-80 split, and if you reject, remember that inflation will affect the next round's value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
