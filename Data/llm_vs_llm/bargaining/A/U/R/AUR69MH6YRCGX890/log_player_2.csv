"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. You get $200000 and I keep $800000. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 (20%) while keeping $800,000 (80%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. Next round, $200,000 would only be worth $180,000 to me

This is not a fair split at all. Even with inflation risk, I should reject this offer since:
1. The split is too uneven (20-80)
2. I can make a more reasonable counter-offer next round
3. The 10% inflation loss is preferable to accepting such an unfair division

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for both our interests:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is much fairer than the previous 20-80 split, and if you reject, remember that inflation will affect the next round's value.""}

My reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a more equitable split (55-45)
2. This is significantly fairer than Alice's initial 20-80 proposal
3. I'm taking a slightly larger share since I know I'm affected by inflation
4. I'm reminding Alice about inflation to encourage acceptance
5. This offer leaves both parties with a substantial amount"
