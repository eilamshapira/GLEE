"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting us. Since I lose value faster than Bob (20% vs 5% per round), I should propose a favorable split for both of us in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because it's important to reach an agreement quickly due to the inflation penalties. This split gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my higher inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $40 is worth only 80% of original value = $32 effective value
   * Bob's $60 is worth 95% of original value = $57 effective value
2. If I reject, next round I can propose again, but:
   * Values will decrease further (I'll lose another 20%, Bob another 5%)
   * The inflation penalty is much harsher for me

While I'd prefer a higher share, the rapid inflation rate affecting my portion (20% per round) makes it risky to reject. If we continue negotiating, my purchasing power will decrease significantly faster than Bob's.
