"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect on my portion.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me. If we keep going back and forth, the value continues decreasing for me, which means there's a cost to prolonged negotiation.

Given that this is a first offer with a perfectly equal split, and considering that delaying would reduce my potential gain due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
