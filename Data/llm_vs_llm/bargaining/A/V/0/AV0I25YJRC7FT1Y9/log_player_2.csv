"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unfavorable to me. She's offering me only 10% of the total amount ($100,000) while keeping 90% ($900,000) for herself. Given that inflation impacts her more severely than me (20% vs 10% per round), I have an advantage by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to make a fair offer that considers our different inflation rates. The money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice compared to round 1.

For me to be indifferent between accepting now vs. next round, I should account for the 10% depreciation. For Alice, she faces a 20% depreciation, which gives me some leverage in negotiations.

I'll propose a more balanced split that still acknowledges our different positions:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this more equitable division because it recognizes both our interests while accounting for the differential inflation rates. This gives Alice a substantial portion while still being fair to myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the current inflation rates.

At this point:
- My money is worth 19% less than in round 1
- Alice's money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My money would be worth 27.1% less than round 1 (additional 10% loss)
- Alice's money would be worth 48.8% less than round 1 (additional 20% loss)

Alice has now offered me $450,000, which is significantly better than her initial $100,000 offer. This amount adjusted for inflation is still substantial, and the differential inflation rates are working in my favor.

If I reject, I could potentially get more in the next round, but Alice might also reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation for both of us. Alice's current offer is fair given the circumstances.
