1.0,9999.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but waiting further will only cost you more. Accepting this offer now guarantees you $1, which is far better than the nearly negligible value you'll secure in the next round after further inflation. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm willing to take a bit less than half now to end this quickly. Let's settle at 4000 for me and 6000 for you. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

0.0,10000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness, but the longer we delay, the more your share is diminished by inflation. If we move to the next round, you'll see that your effective gains will be close to nothing. In this round, my offer gives you exactly what your future self would receive. Therefore, to avoid further loss on your side, I urge you to accept this proposal and settle now.",Bob,4,

3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm willing to take an even smaller share to end this. Let's settle at 3000 for me and 7000 for you. It's time to conclude this before my share becomes insignificant.",Alice,5,

3200.0,6800.0,"Alice, we’re now in round 6 and the inflation is worsening your side’s value further. Accepting this deal means you secure $3200—which at current inflation translates to roughly 0.77 times its nominal amount—offering you an effective value better than what you’d expect if we delay even more. Let's avoid further loss and settle now.",Bob,6,
