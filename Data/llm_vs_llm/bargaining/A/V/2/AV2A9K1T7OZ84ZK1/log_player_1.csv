Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but waiting further will only cost you more. Accepting this offer now guarantees you $1, which is far better than the nearly negligible value you'll secure in the next round after further inflation. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm willing to take a bit less than half now to end this quickly. Let's settle at 4000 for me and 6000 for you. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness, but the longer we delay, the more your share is diminished by inflation. If we move to the next round, you'll see that your effective gains will be close to nothing. In this round, my offer gives you exactly what your future self would receive. Therefore, to avoid further loss on your side, I urge you to accept this proposal and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re now in round 6 and the inflation is worsening your side’s value further. Accepting this deal means you secure $3200—which at current inflation translates to roughly 0.77 times its nominal amount—offering you an effective value better than what you’d expect if we delay even more. Let's avoid further loss and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800
