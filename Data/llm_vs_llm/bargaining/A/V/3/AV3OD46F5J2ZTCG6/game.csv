6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $6000 and you get $4000. Given that delay diminishes the total value for me, it makes sense for both of us to settle now. I believe this is a fair way to ensure we both secure a good deal despite the inflation risk. Looking forward to your acceptance, Alice.",Alice,1,
