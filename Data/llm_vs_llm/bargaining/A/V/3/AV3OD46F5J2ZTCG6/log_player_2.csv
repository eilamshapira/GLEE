"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $6000 and you get $4000. Given that delay diminishes the total value for me, it makes sense for both of us to settle now. I believe this is a fair way to ensure we both secure a good deal despite the inflation risk. Looking forward to your acceptance, Alice. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
