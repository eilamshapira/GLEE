"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that is fair but acknowledges the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, my share loses value while yours doesn't. This offer gives us both nearly equal effective value and avoids multiple rounds of negotiation that would reduce the total value for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share. Since my share is not affected by inflation, delaying the deal will only decrease the value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5450, 
""bob_gain"": 4550, 
""message"": ""Bob, a 50-50 split isn't actually fair because of the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. My $5000 would only be worth $4750 in round 2, and just $4512 now in round 3. I need slightly more to compensate for this disadvantage. This offer accounts for the value I've already lost and is actually equitable in real value. Further delays will only reduce our combined utility.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your share is still worth more than mine in real value. Let's settle on this offer to avoid further delays and potential loss of value for you. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your acknowledgment of the inflation issue, but your offer doesn't adequately address it. With nearly 15% inflation affecting me already, a 48-52 split still gives you an advantage. This offer of 55-45 compensates for the cumulative inflation I've already faced and represents a truly fair division in real value. Let's conclude this now - further delays will only harm both of our interests as I'll need to request even more to offset continued inflation.""}"
