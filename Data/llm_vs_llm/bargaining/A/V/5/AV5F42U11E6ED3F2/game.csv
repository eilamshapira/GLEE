6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal to start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the upcoming inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a bit more balanced considering we're losing value each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm countering with 58/42. We both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, with inflation reducing our gains, I suggest a 52/48 split. It's more equitable given the circumstances, and we need to settle soon to minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, time is running out.  55/45 is my final offer.  Let's be done with this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're losing value fast. Let's agree on a 50/50 split to end this now. It's fair and stops us from losing any more to inflation.",Bob,6,
