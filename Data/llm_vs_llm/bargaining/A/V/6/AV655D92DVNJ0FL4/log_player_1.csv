Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation hitting us hard, a 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. Let's agree and stop the value from dropping further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Taking Bob's offer is the best course of action at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing with each round. While I don't know how it affects Bob, it's clearly impacting me. Accepting a 50/50 split now secures a reasonable amount.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is risky. The gains would be increasingly marginal even if I could secure a slightly larger share. 
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know how Bob is valuing the money or how much longer he's willing to negotiate. Accepting a sure thing now avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal later."
