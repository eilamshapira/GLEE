"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split. This benefits both of us in the long run, considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Worth 10% less to Alice
   - $400,000 now > $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000 in next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the high inflation rate affecting me (20%) makes waiting risky. Even if I could get a better split next round, the 20% loss in value would likely negate any gains.

A 40% share ($400,000) right now is actually a fair offer considering the inflation penalties.
