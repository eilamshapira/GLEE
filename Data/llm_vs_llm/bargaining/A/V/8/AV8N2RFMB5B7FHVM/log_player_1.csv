"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 60/40 for me, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $400,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000.

Considering this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again due to inflation, I need to make a more attractive offer to Bob while also considering my own decreasing value.

In Round 3, the value of the money I receive is effectively $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $810,000 (since it's the second round of inflation for me).

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game. Let's see how he responds!"
