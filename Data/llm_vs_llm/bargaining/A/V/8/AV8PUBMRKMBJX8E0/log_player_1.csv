"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll consider the impact of inflation on my decision-making. Since we have 12 rounds maximum and each round decreases the value by 5% for me, I should aim to reach an agreement quickly while still getting a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division and should be acceptable to both of us. A fair split now is better than prolonging negotiations while inflation reduces the value of my share."
