"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation, but ensures we both get a good amount.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slightly larger share to protect against potential inflation if Bob refuses, while still being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation for me, if I accept, my $5000 is actually worth $4500
2. If I reject and we continue, the next round will have even more inflation
3. This is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms
4. Bob's first rejection of my slightly favorable offer suggests they're looking for fairness
5. Given the mounting inflation pressure, this is probably a reasonable deal to take
