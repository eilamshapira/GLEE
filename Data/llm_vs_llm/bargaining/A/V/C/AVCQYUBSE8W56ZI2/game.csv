2857.0,7143.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fair division. Considering how the value of money drops for both of us—10% for me and 20% for you—with each round, delaying isn’t in either of our best interests. In this round, I propose a split where I take $7143 and you get $2857. This division mirrors our future payoffs if we were to delay further. I believe this is a fair, rational offer given the circumstances. I hope you’ll agree to settle now so we both avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Let's find a middle ground, considering our losses. This split should be more favorable to both of us than waiting further.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. However, given the inflationary penalties—as my share is multiplied by 0.81 this round—I can expect to secure a better outcome if I make the next proposal. I believe waiting one more round is in my best interest, so I must reject this offer.",Bob,3,reject
2900.0,7100.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure of ongoing losses—each round further erodes our funds (my share loses 10% per round, yours 20%). By delaying, your future effective value as proposer in round 5 is estimated to be around $1462, when discounted. To give you a slight edge and ensure you’re at least as well‐off as waiting, I’m offering you $2900 nominal (worth about $1485 effective in round 4) while I take $7100. I believe this is a fair settlement now that avoids further loss for both of us. Let’s settle and put these diminishing dollars to good use.",Bob,4,
