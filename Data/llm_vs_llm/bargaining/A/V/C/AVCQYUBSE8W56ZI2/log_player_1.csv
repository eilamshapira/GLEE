"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fair division. Considering how the value of money drops for both of us—10% for me and 20% for you—with each round, delaying isn’t in either of our best interests. In this round, I propose a split where I take $7143 and you get $2857. This division mirrors our future payoffs if we were to delay further. I believe this is a fair, rational offer given the circumstances. I hope you’ll agree to settle now so we both avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I should think carefully about this offer.

Since the original amount was $10,000 and the money I gain is worth 20% less, the actual value of the money for me in this round is 80% of the original value. 

Bob's offer gives me $2857, but considering the 20% reduction in value, I need to calculate if this is a good deal for me.

However, given the significant disparity in the offer and the fact that I would be giving up a large portion of the potential value, I think it's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round (which was already 20% less than the original), so it's 64% of the original value for me. For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round (which was already 10% less than the original), so it's 81% of the original value for him.

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer Bob a bit more than half, considering his loss is less than mine.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering our losses. This split should be more favorable to both of us than waiting further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressure of ongoing losses—each round further erodes our funds (my share loses 10% per round, yours 20%). By delaying, your future effective value as proposer in round 5 is estimated to be around $1462, when discounted. To give you a slight edge and ensure you’re at least as well‐off as waiting, I’m offering you $2900 nominal (worth about $1485 effective in round 4) while I take $7100. I believe this is a fair settlement now that avoids further loss for both of us. Let’s settle and put these diminishing dollars to good use. 
# Alice gain: 2900 
# Bob gain: 7100 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, I need to carefully evaluate his new offer, considering the significant inflation that has occurred.

Given that the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer gives me $2900, I must calculate the effective value of this offer. Since the original amount was $10,000, and my share would be worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%), the effective value of $2900 for me would indeed be around $1485, as Bob mentioned.

However, I should also consider the alternative: waiting for the next round and making a proposal myself. If I wait, the value of the money for me will decrease even further, to 38.4% of the original value (51.2% * 0.8, due to the 20% reduction).

Bob's offer, although not ideal, seems to take into account the diminishing value of our potential shares. Given the significant loss in value that I would incur by waiting, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer and settle now.
