Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fair division. Considering how the value of money drops for both of us—10% for me and 20% for you—with each round, delaying isn’t in either of our best interests. In this round, I propose a split where I take $7,143 and you get $2,857. This division mirrors our future payoffs if we were to delay further. I believe this is a fair, rational offer given the circumstances. I hope you’ll agree to settle now so we both avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground, considering our losses. This split should be more favorable to both of us than waiting further. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. However, given the inflationary penalties—as my share is multiplied by 0.81 this round—I can expect to secure a better outcome if I make the next proposal. I believe waiting one more round is in my best interest, so I must reject this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7100, ""alice_gain"": 2900, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressure of ongoing losses—each round further erodes our funds (my share loses 10% per round, yours 20%). By delaying, your future effective value as proposer in round 5 is estimated to be around $1,462, when discounted. To give you a slight edge and ensure you’re at least as well‐off as waiting, I’m offering you $2,900 nominal (worth about $1,485 effective in round 4) while I take $7,100. I believe this is a fair settlement now that avoids further loss for both of us. Let’s settle and put these diminishing dollars to good use.""}"
