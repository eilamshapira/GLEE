"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered ""fair""
2. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in rejecting:
   - I don't know Alice's inflation rate
   - We have limited rounds
   - Alice might make a worse offer next time
3. My inflation rate is 0%, so the money's value won't change for me
4. $500,000 is a substantial amount

Given there's no penalty for me to wait but unknown risks, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal. If we can't reach a better agreement, we can always fall back to a 50-50 split in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Alice to potentially accept:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

My reasoning:
1. The offer is still giving Alice a substantial amount ($400,000)
2. The increase in my share isn't so dramatic that it should appear unfair
3. Since I know I have no inflation pressure, I can afford to make this moderate push
4. If Alice rejects, we still have many rounds to negotiate
5. This creates room for future negotiation while starting from a position advantageous to me"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased my share from her initial offer ($525,000 vs $500,000)
2. I now know Alice faces inflation (9.75% so far), which explains why she might be more eager to conclude
3. My portion remains unaffected by inflation
4. This offer is better than the first one, but still less than what I proposed
5. Given Alice's inflation pressure, she might be willing to offer even more in the next round
6. We still have 9 rounds left, and I face no inflation risk

Since I have no inflation pressure and Alice's inflation is significant, I can strategically wait for a potentially better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I know Alice faces significant inflation (9.75% after just 2 rounds), I can leverage this position. However, I should still be reasonable to maintain a good chance of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal
2. I have no inflation pressure, so I can afford to be more aggressive
3. $350,000 is still a significant amount for Alice, even with her inflation
4. If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less due to inflation
5. This is a moderate increase from my previous offer, showing a clear negotiation pattern
6. If she rejects, we still have 8 rounds to find agreement, giving me room to adjust if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Alice is now facing 18.55% inflation, making her $450,000 effectively worth only about $366,525
2. She's gradually increasing my share ($500K → $525K → $550K) showing she's feeling pressure
3. I have no inflation pressure, so my $550,000 maintains full value
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Alice's inflation is increasing significantly (from 9.75% to 18.55%)
6. The rate of inflation increase suggests Alice will face even more pressure in future rounds

Given that Alice's inflation is accelerating and I have no time pressure, I can still push for a better deal. The significant inflation pressure on Alice suggests she may offer even more favorable terms in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Alice's accelerating inflation (now at 18.55%) and her pattern of increasing offers to me, I'll push for a stronger position while still leaving her a meaningful amount:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice's inflation is accelerating rapidly (0% → 9.75% → 18.55%)
2. She's shown willingness to increase my share in each offer
3. Her $300,000 with 18.55% inflation is worth about $244,350 to her, and will be worth even less next round
4. I maintain full value with no inflation
5. We still have 6 rounds left, but Alice's rapidly increasing inflation suggests she can't afford to wait much longer
6. If she rejects, her negotiating position will be even weaker in the next round due to higher inflation
7. This offer maintains enough value for Alice to potentially accept while capitalizing on my stronger negotiating position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice's inflation has increased dramatically to 26.49%
2. Her $425,000 is effectively worth only about $312,416 to her
3. She's continuing to increase my share in small increments ($550K → $575K)
4. My $575,000 maintains full value due to no inflation
5. We have 5 rounds left
6. Alice's inflation is accelerating (18.55% → 26.49%), suggesting even greater pressure on her in future rounds
7. Her pattern of offers shows she's willing to go higher, but is trying to minimize her concessions

Given the accelerating inflation rate and Alice's clear pattern of increasing offers under pressure, I believe I can still get a better deal by waiting. The rapid inflation increase suggests she'll need to make a significantly better offer soon.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Alice's rapidly accelerating inflation (now 26.49%) and her clear pattern of making increasingly better offers under pressure, I'll increase my previous demand but still ensure it's not so extreme as to be automatically rejected:

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice's inflation has increased dramatically (18.55% → 26.49%), suggesting she's under severe time pressure
2. Her $250,000 with current inflation would be worth about $183,775 to her, but still a significant amount
3. We have 4 rounds left, but her accelerating inflation makes each round increasingly costly for her
4. She's shown a consistent pattern of increasing my share ($500K → $525K → $550K → $575K)
5. I maintain full value with no inflation, so I can afford to be aggressive
6. If she rejects, her next round will likely see inflation over 30%, putting her in an even weaker negotiating position
7. This offer represents a logical progression from my previous offer of $700K, maintaining negotiation momentum"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice's inflation has increased to 33.66%
2. Her $400,000 is now only worth about $265,360 to her due to inflation
3. She's still incrementing my share, now at $600K
4. My $600,000 maintains full value
5. We have only 3 rounds left
6. Alice's inflation is severely accelerating (26.49% → 33.66%)
7. The risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement (where we both get nothing) is becoming more real

However:
1. With 3 rounds left and Alice's severe inflation pressure, she's likely to make an even better offer next round
2. Her inflation is increasing by roughly 7% per round
3. My last offer of $750K wasn't accepted, but her situation has worsened significantly since then

Given the severe inflation pressure on Alice and only 3 rounds remaining, I believe she will be forced to make a substantially better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only 2 rounds remaining after this and Alice's severe inflation (33.66% and rising), I'll maintain strong pressure while ensuring the offer isn't so extreme as to risk total failure:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice's inflation is severe and accelerating (around 7% increase per round)
2. Her $200,000 at current inflation is worth about $132,680, but next round will be worth even less
3. Only 2 rounds remain after this - the threat of mutual zero payoff is real
4. However, Alice's rapidly worsening position makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal
5. I maintain full value with no inflation
6. She's shown willingness to increase my share consistently
7. This offer balances between:
   - Capitalizing on Alice's weakening position
   - Leaving enough value for Alice to potentially accept
   - Not risking total failure with too extreme an offer
   - Creating room for one final negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 625000 
# Alice gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this critical situation:

1. We're now at the second-to-last round (only one round left after this)
2. Alice's inflation is at 40.13%, making her $375,000 worth only about $224,513
3. She's offering me $625,000 at full value
4. If we don't reach agreement in either this round or the next, we BOTH get ZERO

Critical considerations:
1. While I could make one final counter-offer, that would be our last chance before both getting nothing
2. The risk of getting nothing is now very real
3. $625,000 is a substantial improvement from her initial $500,000 offer
4. While I might get more by rejecting, the risk/reward ratio has shifted significantly due to the impending deadline

Given that we're one round away from mutual destruction, and I have a guaranteed $625,000 on the table (which is 25% more than the initial offer), I believe it's prudent to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing.
