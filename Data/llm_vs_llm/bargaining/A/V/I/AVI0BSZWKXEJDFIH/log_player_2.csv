"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
- This is a 45-55 split in Alice's favor
- If I reject, the total amount will be worth 20% less ($800,000)
- I would need to make a counter-offer next round
- While not perfectly equal, this is a reasonably fair offer
- The risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting a slightly lower share reasonable
