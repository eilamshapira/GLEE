"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $53 for me and $47 for you. Given that every round decreases the total value by 10%, this is the most efficient deal we can reach right now. Accepting this offer ensures you get $47 without any further loss from waiting. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about we split it evenly at $50 each? This way, we both get a fair share without worrying about the decreasing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
