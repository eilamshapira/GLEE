"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $53 for me and $47 for you. Given that every round decreases the total value by 10%, this is the most efficient deal we can reach right now. Accepting this offer ensures you get $47 without any further loss from waiting. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
