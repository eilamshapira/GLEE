Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, considering the inflation, I need to adjust my offer. For me, the value of the money is 10% less than in round 1, and for Bob, it's 20% less. To make this worthwhile for both of us and increase the chances of acceptance, I'll offer slightly more to Bob.
