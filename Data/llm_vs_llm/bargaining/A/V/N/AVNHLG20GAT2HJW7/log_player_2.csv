"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. While $40 is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total $100. Since I know I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject this, I'll reject this somewhat unfair split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but slightly in my favor since Alice tried to get a larger share first. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more equitable than the previous 60-40 split but still gives me a small advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has only slightly improved her offer from the first round (from 40 to 42 for me). This is still quite far from a fair split, and since we've seen that both parties are willing to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and try to reach a more equitable arrangement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll slightly moderate my previous offer to show willingness to compromise, but still maintain a position that's more balanced than Alice's offers. I'll propose a 52-48 split in my favor, which is very close to equal but gives me a small edge.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is only making minimal improvements to her offers (from 42 to 43 now), while still trying to maintain a significant advantage for herself. Given that we're in round 5 and the pattern suggests she's unlikely to make a substantially better offer, I'll still reject this unfair split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now several rounds in and need to move towards convergence, I'll make a very fair offer that's hard to reject rationally. I'll propose an exactly equal split, showing I'm willing to be completely fair to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
