5000.0,5000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, 50-50. What do you say, Bob?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'll take a slightly larger share now. Inflation is hurting me more! Consider this offer carefully.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand inflation is affecting us differently, but your offer is too skewed in your favor. Let's find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, how about a 45-55 split in your favor? It's a bit more than last time but still fair to both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, inflation is eating away at our potential gains rapidly. I need a larger share to compensate for my losses. 70/30 is my offer.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, a 70-30 split is too extreme. We need to find a middle ground that considers both our needs. Let's keep negotiating.",Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, let's try a 40-60 split in your favor. It's more than my last offer but still keeps things reasonable given the inflation rates.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. I need 7500 to make this worth it. This is a serious offer, take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand the urgency, but a 75-25 split is too one-sided. We need to find a compromise that works for both of us before it's too late.",Alice,6,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Bob, time is running out, and inflation is hitting us hard. How about a 35-65 split in your favor? It's a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's fair given our situation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, this is it. We're almost out of time. 8000 for me, 2000 for you. It's the only way I'm accepting. Final offer!",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, an 80-20 split is too extreme. We're both losing out if we don't reach an agreement soon. Let's find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,8,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. How about a 30-70 split in your favor? It's a big step towards your last offer but still keeps something fair for me.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, desperation time. I need 8500. You get 1500. Take it or we both get nothing. No more games.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, an 85-15 split is too extreme. We're both at risk of getting nothing if we don't compromise. Let's find a more reasonable solution in the next round.",Alice,10,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire. How about a 25-75 split in your favor? It's close to your last offer but still gives me something. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, this is the END. 9000 for me, 1000 for you. It's the only way I'm accepting. LAST. OFFER.",Bob,12,
,,"Bob, it's not ideal, but we're out of time. I'll accept the 90-10 split to avoid both of us getting nothing.",Alice,12,accept
