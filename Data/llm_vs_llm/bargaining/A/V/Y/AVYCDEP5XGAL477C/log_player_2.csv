"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which means I would get $5,000. This is a perfectly fair division. Since there's no inflation for me according to the rules, the money won't lose value over rounds. However, I don't know if Alice faces inflation, which might make her more eager to settle quickly.

While I could reject and propose something more favorable to me in the next round, a 50-50 split is already fair, and there's a risk that we might end up with nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds.
