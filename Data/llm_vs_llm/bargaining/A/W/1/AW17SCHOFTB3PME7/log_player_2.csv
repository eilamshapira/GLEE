"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $9,500 for me (10,000 * 0.95). I'll make an offer that splits this amount roughly in the middle.

{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,025 to me (10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95). Alice's offer of $4,500 is approximately 49.8% of the original $9,025 value. I'll accept this offer as it seems reasonable given the decreasing value of the money.
