"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer that tries to be fair while acknowledging that inflation impacts me more with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face decreasing value in future rounds due to inflation."
