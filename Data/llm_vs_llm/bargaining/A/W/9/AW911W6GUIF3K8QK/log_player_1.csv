"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of the money as the rounds progress. I want to secure a good deal for myself while also ensuring Bob accepts the offer to avoid losing everything.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Fairness (perceived):** This gives me a slightly larger share, which might be seen as a reasonable opening offer given I'm proposing first.
*   **Bob's Incentive:** $4000 is a significant amount, especially in the first round, and should be tempting for Bob to accept rather than risk further devaluation.
*   **Negotiation Room:** This leaves some room for negotiation in later rounds if Bob rejects, though I'll need to adjust my offers carefully to account for the diminishing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is trying to be fair by offering an even split. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **My Perspective:** If I accept, I get $5000, but it's worth 10% less than in round 1. So it's effectively worth $5000 * 0.9 = $4500.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** He also gets $5000, but it's worth 20% less than in round 1. So it's effectively worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000.

I think this is a close call, but it's better than risking further devaluation in future rounds. Also, my negotiation position worsens with each passing round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
