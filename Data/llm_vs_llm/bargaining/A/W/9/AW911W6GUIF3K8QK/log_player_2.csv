"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the impact of inflation on both of us.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%), while keeping $6,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject, we'll move to Round 2 where I can make a counteroffer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This means the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 for me and $9,000 for Alice in the next round.

Since I can make a better counteroffer in the next round and the inflation rates disadvantage me more than Alice, I should reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer considering our different inflation rates. Since money devalues faster for me (20% per round) than for Alice (10% per round), there's more pressure on me to reach an agreement sooner.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives each of us $5,000, which is equitable and reasonable. This offer increases my share from Alice's initial proposal while still giving Alice a substantial amount. Given the accelerating inflation that affects me more severely than Alice, a fair split now benefits both of us by avoiding further devaluation of the total sum."
