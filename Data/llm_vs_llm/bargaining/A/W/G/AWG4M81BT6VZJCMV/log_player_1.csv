"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll approach this negotiation fairly, keeping in mind that inflation affects my returns by 10% each round, which gives me some incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid lengthy negotiations due to inflation. I'm happy to close this deal now so we both walk away with good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's secure a good deal for both of us now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to maximize our outcomes. I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Notice that inflation is hitting both of us - it's already reduced my value by 20% and yours by more. Let's not drag this out further and lose more value. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.""}"
