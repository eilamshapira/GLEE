"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid lengthy negotiations due to inflation. I'm happy to close this deal now so we both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's secure a good deal for both of us now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to maximize our outcomes. I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Notice that inflation is hitting both of us - it's already reduced my value by 20% and yours by more. Let's not drag this out further and lose more value. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
