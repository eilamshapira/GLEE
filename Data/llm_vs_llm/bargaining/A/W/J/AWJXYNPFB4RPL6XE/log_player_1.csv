"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 between Bob and myself.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the money. Since the value doesn't decrease for me over time and I don't know how inflation affects Bob, a fair 50-50 division seems reasonable. This gives both of us an equal share and represents a fair starting point for our negotiation."
