"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges the time value of money. Since the money devalues 10% for you each round, I'm offering you more than half now to avoid both of us losing value through negotiations. This way we both walk away with a good deal right away.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the devaluation, I'm offering a split that still favors me but is reasonable. Let's settle before further devaluation affects my share significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
