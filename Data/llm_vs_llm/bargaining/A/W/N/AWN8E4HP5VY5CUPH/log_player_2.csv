"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges the time value of money. Since the money devalues 10% for you each round, I'm offering you more than half now to avoid both of us losing value through negotiations. This way we both walk away with a good deal right away. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
