"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a fair offer to Bob, but also consider the impact of inflation on my earnings. Since inflation will reduce the value of the money for me by 5% each round, I should try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that I'm facing inflation pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Bob wants $60 while offering me $40. If I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth another 5% less, meaning I'll effectively get 5% less value from whatever amount we agree on in the next round.

I notice that Bob is facing even steeper inflation (20% per round), which gives me some leverage in future rounds. However, I still need to be reasonable to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob is facing a steeper inflation (20% per round) compared to my 5%, I should leverage this information in my new offer. Bob should be more motivated to reach an agreement quickly, so I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose a slight adjustment to our split - I get $52 and you get $48. This is a more balanced division that gives you a better deal than my previous offer, considering we both face inflation pressures."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Bob is now offering me $35 and taking $65, which is an even more uneven split than before. However, Bob's inflation penalty is much higher than mine (48.8% vs. 14.26%), which means the longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for Bob.

If I reject and we continue to round 5, my money will be worth about 19% less than the original value, while Bob's will be worth nearly 60% less. Given this severe inflation pressure on Bob, I expect I can get a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the severe inflation Bob is facing (nearly 50% already and likely to get worse), I should be able to leverage this to get a better deal. However, I also need to be reasonable enough that Bob will accept, as continuing for too many more rounds will hurt us both.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This offer reflects the reality of our different inflation rates - you're facing much higher inflation than I am, so it makes sense for you to accept a deal sooner rather than later. This division will maximize our combined value before inflation erodes it further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This situation is getting interesting. Bob continues to ask for more ($70 now) despite facing severe inflation (67.23% loss in value). This suggests Bob might be playing hardball or doesn't fully understand how badly inflation is affecting his position.

If I reject this offer, my money in the next round will be worth about 27% less than original value, while Bob's will be worth over 70% less. Bob's position continues to weaken much faster than mine.

Bob's current offer of $30 at 22.62% inflation means I'd effectively get about $23.21 in original value. If I make a counter-offer next round and get more, even with increased inflation, I could do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Bob's inflation penalty is now extremely severe (over 67% and climbing), yet he's still making aggressive offers. This suggests he's either not understanding the inflation dynamics or is hoping I'll eventually give in. Given the rapidly deteriorating value for Bob, I should propose a fair offer that will be more valuable for both of us than continuing this standoff.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and you get $35. Bob, given your severe inflation rate of over 67%, your $35 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. This offer is actually favorable to you when accounting for inflation. We should reach an agreement now before inflation further erodes the value for both of us."
