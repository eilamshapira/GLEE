Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, considering the potential for future losses due to the round limit and inflation on my end:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning is that I am valuing getting a larger share now to offset the potential inflation impact on my gains. I hope Alice sees this as a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
