Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's value of money decreases by 20% each round, and it's now the 3rd round, his value of money has decreased by 20% twice (40% total decrease from original value), but for simplicity in calculation, we'll consider the decrease in value for Bob as 20% each round. 

For me (Alice), the value remains the same. Considering this, I'll make an offer that slightly favors me but is still reasonable.
