"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a generous split to get this over with quickly. Let's take our share and go! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $30 while keeping $70 for herself
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, where:
   - The money will be worth 20% less for me (so $100 becomes worth $80)
   - The money will be worth 5% less for Alice
   - I'll get to make the next offer

$30 right now is better than having the ability to propose a split of money that's worth 20% less to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, I'd be working with effectively $80, making it hard to get more than $30.
