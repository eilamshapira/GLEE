"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split. No need to risk further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation affecting my share, if I accept:
* I would get $5000, but it's worth only $4000 to me due to inflation
* Bob would get $5000, worth full value to him

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
* My share would be worth another 20% less
* I'd need to offer Bob enough to make him accept
* There's risk of further rounds and more inflation

Given that Bob's offer already puts me at a disadvantage due to inflation, and rejecting would make my position even worse...
