"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I believe this is a good starting point for us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't exactly fair.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me ($80 value)
- But only 5% less to Alice ($95 value)
- I could propose a more favorable split

However, Alice's proposed split isn't terrible, and the rapid 20% inflation for me vs. only 5% for Alice means delaying could hurt me more than her.

I'll reject this round since I believe I can get a better deal, and the first-round inflation penalty isn't too severe yet.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates, I need to be strategic but also reasonable to get Alice to accept.

After my rejection, the money is now worth:
- For me: $80 (20% less)
- For Alice: $95 (5% less)

I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.
