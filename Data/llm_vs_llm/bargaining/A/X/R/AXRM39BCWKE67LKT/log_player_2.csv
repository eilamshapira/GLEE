"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation factor that affects me. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me, but not to Alice.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, we go to round 2 where the $10,000 is worth only $9,000 to me, but still $10,000 to Alice. Even if I propose a better split for myself in round 2, I'm already at a disadvantage due to inflation.

A 50-50 split in round 1 gives me $5,000, which is better than what I would likely get if I reject and the negotiation continues with the inflation penalty.
