"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, the next round my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's only 5% less
3. The split is 60-40 in Alice's favor, which isn't quite fair
4. However, given the asymmetric inflation rates, I might lose more by negotiating

Since Alice has a much better inflation rate (5% vs my 20%), she has more negotiating power. While 40% isn't ideal, it might be better to accept now than risk getting less in future rounds due to the harsh inflation rate on my side.
