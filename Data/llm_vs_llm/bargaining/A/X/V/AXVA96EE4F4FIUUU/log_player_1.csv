"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an even 50-50 split. This ensures fairness for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $5000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation
   * My real value = $5000 * 0.9 = $4500

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my gains will be worth 20% less due to inflation
   * Even if I managed to get $6000 in the next round, it would be worth $4800 real value
   * And Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation losses

Given that waiting another round would mean more value loss due to inflation, and this is a reasonable offer that gives me $4500 in real value, I should accept.
