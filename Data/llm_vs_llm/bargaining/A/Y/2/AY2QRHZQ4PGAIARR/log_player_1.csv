"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 
Reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases significantly with each round. It's in my best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Shifting Advantage:** While the money is devaluing for both of us, it's devaluing faster for me. This means Bob's incentive to accept a slightly less favorable deal increases with each round. 
* **Predicting Bob:** Bob's previous offer suggests he's aiming for a larger share. By offering him slightly more than he proposed last round (while still securing a majority for myself), I increase the chances of him accepting."
