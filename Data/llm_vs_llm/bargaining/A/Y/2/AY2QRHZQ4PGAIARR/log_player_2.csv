"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Currently being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but:
   * My money will be worth 10% less ($90 total value)
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less ($80 total value)
3. This gives me negotiating power, as Alice has more to lose from delays

Given that I can likely get a better deal next round (since Alice loses value faster than I do), and $40 seems a bit low for an equal split:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice loses value faster than I do (20% vs 10% per round), and she rejected an even split, I'll propose a split slightly in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's not too far from a 50-50 split
2. If Alice rejects, her next round's $100 will only be worth $80 to her
3. It's better for Alice than what she'd likely get after another round of depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $45, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $36.45 to me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 29% less than original
   * Alice's money will be worth 56% less than original
   * This means another round would significantly reduce value for both of us
3. Alice has moved from her initial 40-60 split to a more reasonable 45-55 split
4. Further negotiation will lead to more value loss for both of us

Given that the value loss is accelerating and Alice has made a reasonable compromise, I should accept this offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
