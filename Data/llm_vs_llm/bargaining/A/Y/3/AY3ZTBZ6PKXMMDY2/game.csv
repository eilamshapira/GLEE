6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the higher inflation penalty I face (20% vs your 5%). Let's resolve this quickly to maximize value for both of us.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Given the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the urgency to settle and the fact that my inflation rate, though lower, still impacts my share significantly. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with a reasonable amount before the value drops further.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers, considering I face a much steeper inflation rate (20% vs 5%). At this point, we're both losing value - let's reach an agreement quickly.",Alice,3,

4750.0,5250.0,"Considering the significant value loss we're both facing, I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the higher inflation rate you're dealing with, but also the fact that we need to settle soon to preserve as much value as possible. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
