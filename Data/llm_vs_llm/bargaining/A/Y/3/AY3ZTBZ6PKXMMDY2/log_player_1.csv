Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the urgency to settle and the fact that my inflation rate, though lower, still impacts my share significantly. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with a reasonable amount before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

# Bob's message: Considering the significant value loss we're both facing, I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the higher inflation rate you're dealing with, but also the fact that we need to settle soon to preserve as much value as possible. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses.
