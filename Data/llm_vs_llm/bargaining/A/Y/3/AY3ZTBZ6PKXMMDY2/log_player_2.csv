Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the higher inflation penalty I face (20% vs your 5%). Let's resolve this quickly to maximize value for both of us.

# Alice gain: 6000

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Given the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the urgency to settle and the fact that my inflation rate, though lower, still impacts my share significantly. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with a reasonable amount before the value drops further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers, considering I face a much steeper inflation rate (20% vs 5%). At this point, we're both losing value - let's reach an agreement quickly.
