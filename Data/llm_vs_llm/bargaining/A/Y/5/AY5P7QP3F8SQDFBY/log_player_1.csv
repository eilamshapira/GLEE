"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a split where I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is a fair starting offer that gives me a slight advantage while still providing Bob with a substantial amount."
