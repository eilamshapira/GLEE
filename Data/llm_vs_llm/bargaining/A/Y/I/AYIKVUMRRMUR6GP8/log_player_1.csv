"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for Round 1. Since inflation affects Bob more than me (5% per round for him, 0% for me), I should consider a fair split that acknowledges this time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that allows us both to walk away with significant value right at the beginning."
