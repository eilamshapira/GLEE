"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000. 

However, I need to account for the inflation factor. With each round, the money is worth 5% less to me, while Alice faces no inflation penalty. This puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me. If negotiations continue for multiple rounds, my effective share decreases with each delay.

Given that Alice opened with a fair numerical split and the inflation pressure on my side, I should accept.
