"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in the next round
3. This means I have slightly more negotiating power in later rounds since inflation affects Alice more
4. However, the current offer is substantial and guaranteed
5. Trying to negotiate for more might risk both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds

Given that:
- This is a reasonable first offer
- The risk of losing value through inflation is significant
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later
- We could potentially waste rounds negotiating and lose value
