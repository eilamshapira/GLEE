4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I need a bit more since the money is losing value for me each round. This is still a fair split considering the inflation I'm facing.",Bob,2,

4750.0,5250.0,"Bob, considering the higher inflation rate on my side, I propose $4750 for me and $5250 for you. This way, we both get a fair share adjusted for our respective inflation rates.",Alice,3,
