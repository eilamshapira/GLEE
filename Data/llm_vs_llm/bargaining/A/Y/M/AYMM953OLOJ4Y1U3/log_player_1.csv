"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 3

``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's important to balance getting a larger share with the risk of inflation eroding the value of future offers. 

* **Bob's rejection:**  Bob's rejection of my initial offer (650,000 for me) suggests he might be aiming for a larger share than 350,000.  
* **Inflation impact:** The value of the money is decreasing. While I don't know how Bob values the money over time, my share is decreasing at a faster rate. 
* **This offer:** This offer is a slight concession from my Round 1 offer, aiming to entice Bob while still securing a significant portion of the money before its value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for me. He seems content to let the value decrease, likely assuming the inflation is hitting me harder.
* **Current value:** While 420,000 is less than I wanted initially, due to the inflation, it's better to accept a decent offer now than risk getting even less in the next round.  
* **Uncertainty:** I don't have information about how the inflation is affecting Bob. There's a chance he might be more resistant to it, making further negotiation risky."
