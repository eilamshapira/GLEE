"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, I'll evaluate the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, the $420,000 I'd receive is equivalent to approximately $341,200 in the first round ($420,000 * 0.81). 

Given this, I think the offer is still not in my favor, especially since Alice's gain is also devalued, but more significantly so.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effects, the money is worth 19% less for me after round 1, and another 10% less after round 2, and another 10% less after round 3, which is a total of 19% + 10% + 10% = 39% less. However, the correct calculation for the total decrease is: 
1 * 0.81 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561, which means the money is worth approximately 65.61% of its original value for me.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice's money is worth 36% less after the first round and another 36% less after the second round is not correct, we had 36% less after the second round for Alice, and now we have another 10% less for me and another 36% for Alice, 
1 * 0.64 * 0.64 = 0.4096, which means the money is worth approximately 40.96% of its original value for Alice.

Given this, I'll propose a division that is more in my favor to account for the difference in inflation rates.
