"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  A slightly better deal for me, but we can both leave with something. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $35, keeping $65 for herself
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me
   * The money will be worth 20% less for Alice
   * I'll get to make the next offer
3. With such high inflation for Alice (20%), she'll be more motivated to accept a reasonable counter-offer
4. Given that I'll only lose 5% value, I can afford to negotiate

$35 is too low for my first offer. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%, I can propose a more balanced split that she should find attractive compared to continuing negotiations.

For her, waiting another round would make the money worth only 80% of the current value, while for me it would still be worth 95%.

I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving her a slight advantage to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""This is a fair split considering the inflation rates. You'll get more value accepting now than risking another round with 20% inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer still gives me a slight edge considering the inflation, but it's better for you than the last round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $40, while keeping $60
2. Due to inflation:
   * For me, $40 now is worth about $36.10 (90.25% of original value)
   * For Alice, $60 now is worth about $38.40 (64% of original value)
3. If I reject and go to next round:
   * I'll lose another 5% value
   * Alice will lose another 20% value
   * But I get to make the offer

While this offer is better than her first one ($35), considering the significant inflation impact on Alice's side, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round. The fact that her money is now worth only 64% of the original value puts me in a stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the current situation:

1. The money is now worth 14.26% less for me than at the start
2. For Alice, it's worth 48.8% less than at the start
3. If Alice rejects this offer, she'll lose another 20% value, making her money worth less than half its original value

Given these severe inflation penalties for Alice, she should be very motivated to accept a reasonable offer now rather than continue negotiating. I'll propose a split that gives us nearly equal actual value considering the inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This offer gives us almost equal real value when accounting for inflation. With your 48.8% devaluation, your $48 is worth about $24.6, while my $52 is worth about $44.6 due to my lower inflation. Further negotiation would hurt both of us, especially you.""}"
