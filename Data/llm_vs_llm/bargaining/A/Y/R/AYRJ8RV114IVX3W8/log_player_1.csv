Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. How about we split it equally? This way, neither of us is shortchanged. Consider the impact of inflation if you reject this even split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
