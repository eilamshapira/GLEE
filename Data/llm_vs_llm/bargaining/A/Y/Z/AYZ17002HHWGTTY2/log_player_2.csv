"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair, Bob. How about we split the $100 equally? 50-50 sounds good to me! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this rationally. 
The offer is a 50-50 split, which means I would get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me.
That means even if I somehow got all $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $80 to me.

Since $50 now is better than a maximum of $80 next round (which is unlikely as Alice would probably reject an extremely unfair offer), I should accept this fair offer.
