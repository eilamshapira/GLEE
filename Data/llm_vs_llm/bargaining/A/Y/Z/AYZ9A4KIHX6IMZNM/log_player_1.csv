"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair - a 50-50 split is better for both of us. Remember, your inflation rate is higher than mine (10% vs 5%), so delaying further would hurt you more. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
