"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. A fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while taking $600,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject:
- The money will be worth 5% less to me next round
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice next round
- I get to make the next proposal

Given that Alice has a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), I have some leverage in the next round. By rejecting, I could potentially propose a more favorable split, as the money will be worth less to her than to me.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice now faces 10% depreciation and I face 5%, I can leverage this to get a more favorable split. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is more equitable than her initial offer, and emphasize how the increasing inflation affects her more than me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair - a 50-50 split is better for both of us. Remember, your inflation rate is higher than mine (10% vs 5%), so delaying further would hurt you more. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. 55% for me and 45% for you. It accounts for the inflation difference, but we need to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $450,000 (45%), which is better than her initial 40% offer
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $450,000 is actually worth $406,125 (9.75% less)
   - Alice's $550,000 is worth $445,500 (19% less)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be around 15%
   - Alice's inflation will be around 29%
   - The difference in our inflation rates is growing

While I could try to negotiate for an even better deal, the inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Further delays might end up hurting both of us more than the potential gains from additional negotiation.
