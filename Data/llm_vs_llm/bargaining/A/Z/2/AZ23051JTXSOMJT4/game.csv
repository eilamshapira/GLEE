377669.0,622331.0,"Hi Bob, let’s settle now rather than lose value. Based on our 12‐round bargaining with 10% depreciation per round, if you reject today you’d eventually secure roughly $622331 given you’d propose in round 2. I’m offering you that same amount now. Please accept this fair proposal so we both avoid unnecessary discounting.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
314136.0,685864.0,"Alice, considering the depreciation, I believe this offer is fair and ensures we both get a substantial amount. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s offer gives me only $314136 in round 2, but if I reject I’ll have the chance to propose in round 3. Even with an extra round of depreciation, my best alternative is better than accepting this offer. I’m rejecting your proposal so we can negotiate a division that reflects a fair continuation value for both of us.",Alice,2,reject
343000.0,657000.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the total pot is worth only $810000 in today’s dollars. Based on our future prospects, if you reject this offer, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure roughly $532170 in today’s value. My offer gives you exactly that – 65.7% of the cake – while I retain 34.3%. Accepting now avoids further loss from depreciation. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can.",Alice,3,

260870.0,739130.0,"Alice, given the depreciation, this offer ensures we both get a fair share. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains and avoid further loss.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to settle quickly. However, your offer gives me a nominal $260870 in round 4, which—after accounting for the 27.1% depreciation—yields a present value that is lower than what I expect to secure as the proposer in round 5. By rejecting now, I can propose a division that better reflects the remaining value of the pot (which will drop further if we delay) and ensure I receive a fairer share in light of our future bargaining power. I must reject this offer.",Alice,4,reject
310000.0,690000.0,"Hi Bob, given the further depreciation—this round the dollar is worth only about 65.61% of its original value—I’m proposing a split that reflects both our future bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d get the chance to propose next round, but that opportunity comes with an even smaller pie. I’m offering you a nominal $690000, which in present‐value terms is about $690000 × 0.6561 ≈ $452000. I believe this is roughly in line with what you might secure by waiting, and it avoids further loss for both of us. I hope you’ll agree to settle now.",Alice,5,
