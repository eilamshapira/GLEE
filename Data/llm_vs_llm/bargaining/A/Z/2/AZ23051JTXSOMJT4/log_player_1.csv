"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377669, ""bob_gain"": 622331, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let’s settle now rather than lose value. Based on our 12‐round bargaining with 10% depreciation per round, if you reject today you’d eventually secure roughly $622,331 given you’d propose in round 2. I’m offering you that same amount now. Please accept this fair proposal so we both avoid unnecessary discounting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the depreciation, I believe this offer is fair and ensures we both get a substantial amount. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 314136 
# Bob gain: 685864 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s offer gives me only $314,136 in round 2, but if I reject I’ll have the chance to propose in round 3. Even with an extra round of depreciation, my best alternative is better than accepting this offer. I’m rejecting your proposal so we can negotiate a division that reflects a fair continuation value for both of us.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 343000, ""bob_gain"": 657000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the total pot is worth only $810,000 in today’s dollars. Based on our future prospects, if you reject this offer, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure roughly $532,170 in today’s value. My offer gives you exactly that – 65.7% of the cake – while I retain 34.3%. Accepting now avoids further loss from depreciation. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the depreciation, this offer ensures we both get a fair share. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 260870 
# Bob gain: 739130 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to settle quickly. However, your offer gives me a nominal $260,870 in round 4, which—after accounting for the 27.1% depreciation—yields a present value that is lower than what I expect to secure as the proposer in round 5. By rejecting now, I can propose a division that better reflects the remaining value of the pot (which will drop further if we delay) and ensure I receive a fairer share in light of our future bargaining power. I must reject this offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 310000, ""bob_gain"": 690000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given the further depreciation—this round the dollar is worth only about 65.61% of its original value—I’m proposing a split that reflects both our future bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d get the chance to propose next round, but that opportunity comes with an even smaller pie. I’m offering you a nominal $690,000, which in present‐value terms is about $690,000 × 0.6561 ≈ $452,000. I believe this is roughly in line with what you might secure by waiting, and it avoids further loss for both of us. I hope you’ll agree to settle now.""}"
