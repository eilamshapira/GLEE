"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let’s settle now rather than lose value. Based on our 12‐round bargaining with 10% depreciation per round, if you reject today you’d eventually secure roughly $622331 given you’d propose in round 2. I’m offering you that same amount now. Please accept this fair proposal so we both avoid unnecessary discounting. 
# Bob gain: 622331 
# Alice gain: 377669 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's proposal does not consider the advantage of making the offer in the next round. Given the depreciation, it's better to negotiate for a higher amount in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 685864,
  ""alice_gain"": 314136,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the depreciation, I believe this offer is fair and ensures we both get a substantial amount. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the total pot is worth only $810000 in today’s dollars. Based on our future prospects, if you reject this offer, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure roughly $532170 in today’s value. My offer gives you exactly that – 65.7% of the cake – while I retain 34.3%. Accepting now avoids further loss from depreciation. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can. 
# Bob gain: 657000 
# Alice gain: 343000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer still does not provide a fair division considering the future rounds and the depreciation. It's better to negotiate for a higher amount in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 260870,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the further depreciation—this round the dollar is worth only about 65.61% of its original value—I’m proposing a split that reflects both our future bargaining positions. If you reject, you’d get the chance to propose next round, but that opportunity comes with an even smaller pie. I’m offering you a nominal $690000, which in present‐value terms is about $690000 × 0.6561 ≈ $452000. I believe this is roughly in line with what you might secure by waiting, and it avoids further loss for both of us. I hope you’ll agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 690000 
# Alice gain: 310000
