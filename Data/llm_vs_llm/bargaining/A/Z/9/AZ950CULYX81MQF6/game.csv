5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is a good starting point and we can avoid losing value to inflation. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but $5500 for you seems a bit much. Let's try $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is a more reasonable split considering we are only in round 2.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand you want more, but my initial offer wasn't that far off. Given inflation is eating into the value for both of us (especially for you!), let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5200 and you get $4800. That's a good compromise for both of us considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, inflation is hurting us both, but especially me. Let's aim for a more even split to compensate. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. It's still a good amount for both of us, and avoids further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, we're wasting time and losing money! Inflation is hitting us hard. Let's just split it 50/50. It's fair, and we can both walk away with $5000 before it's worth even less.",Alice,5,
