Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but $5500 for you seems a bit much. Let's try $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This is a more reasonable split considering we are only in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting us both, but especially me. Let's aim for a more even split to compensate. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. It's still a good amount for both of us, and avoids further losses.
