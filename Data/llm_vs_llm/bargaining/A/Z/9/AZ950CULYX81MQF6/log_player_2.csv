"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is a good starting point and we can avoid losing value to inflation. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but my initial offer wasn't that far off. Given inflation is eating into the value for both of us (especially for you!), let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5200 and you get $4800. That's a good compromise for both of us considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're wasting time and losing money! Inflation is hitting us hard. Let's just split it 50/50. It's fair, and we can both walk away with $5000 before it's worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
