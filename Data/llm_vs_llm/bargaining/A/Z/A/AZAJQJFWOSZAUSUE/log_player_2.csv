"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share before inflation affects the value too much.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the impact of inflation, I need to secure a bit more this time. I propose I get 5800 and you get 4200. This still leaves you with a fair amount considering your lower inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think it's fair that I get a bit more this time. This split still gives you a reasonable amount given the circumstances.""}

This offer takes into account the differing inflation rates affecting both players. By offering Alice $4600, she still receives a considerable amount even with the higher inflation rate affecting her. Meanwhile, I secure $5400, which is a fair share given my lower inflation rate. This strategy aims to find a balance that considers the economic factors at play."
