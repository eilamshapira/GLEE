40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering you face 20% inflation per round, I'm offering you $40 now, which is worth more to you than a similar amount in future rounds. This is actually fair given the inflation penalty you face - if we go to another round, your money will be worth even less.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it equally this time. Even though the money is worth less to me now, it's still a fair split. If we continue, inflation will affect me more.",Alice,3,
