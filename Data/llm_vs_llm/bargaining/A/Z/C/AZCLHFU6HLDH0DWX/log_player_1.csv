"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering you face 20% inflation per round, I'm offering you $40 now, which is worth more to you than a similar amount in future rounds. This is actually fair given the inflation penalty you face - if we go to another round, your money will be worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
