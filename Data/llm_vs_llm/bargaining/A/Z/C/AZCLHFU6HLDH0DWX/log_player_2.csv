"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer given the game's inflation mechanics. If I reject, I can propose a new split in the next round, but Alice faces 20% inflation, meaning her portion will be worth less.

Let me analyze: 
- Current offer: I receive $40, Alice receives $60.
- If I reject and we go to round 2, I can make a new offer but Alice's money will be worth 20% less.
- Since I don't face any inflation, there's an advantage to me in continuing.

I could potentially offer a more favorable split to myself in the next round, and Alice might be incentivized to accept due to the inflation penalty she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm now making the offer, I'll take into account that Alice faces 20% inflation per round while I don't. This means Alice has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait and lose value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, considering you face 20% inflation per round, I'm offering you $40 now, which is worth more to you than a similar amount in future rounds. This is actually fair given the inflation penalty you face - if we go to another round, your money will be worth even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally this time. Even though the money is worth less to me now, it's still a fair split. If we continue, inflation will affect me more. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering a 50-50 split. Due to inflation, her $50 is actually worth only $32 to her (50 * 0.64 = 32) due to the 36% cumulative inflation she's experiencing. Meanwhile, my $50 still has full value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I could potentially get a better split, and Alice would face even more inflation (roughly 49% total), making any money she receives worth even less to her.

However, a 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms, and Alice may not be willing to go much lower given she's already facing significant inflation penalties.
