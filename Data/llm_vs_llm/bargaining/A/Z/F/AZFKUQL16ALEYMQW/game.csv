5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob! Since I lose 20% of value each round while you don't face any penalty, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me to account for this disadvantage. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure affects me more. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount!",Alice,1,
