"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the time pressure I face due to the 20% inflation penalty. Let me propose something fair given our different positions:

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I lose 20% of value each round while you don't face any penalty, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me to account for this disadvantage. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure affects me more. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount!""}"
