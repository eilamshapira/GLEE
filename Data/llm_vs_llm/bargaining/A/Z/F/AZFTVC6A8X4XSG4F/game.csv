550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, your offer was very one-sided. Given that I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%), a fair split should be more balanced. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your advantage in the negotiation due to the inflation difference while still being fair to both of us. If we continue to future rounds, we'll both lose value due to inflation.",Bob,2,
