"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was very one-sided. Given that I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%), a fair split should be more balanced. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your advantage in the negotiation due to the inflation difference while still being fair to both of us. If we continue to future rounds, we'll both lose value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
