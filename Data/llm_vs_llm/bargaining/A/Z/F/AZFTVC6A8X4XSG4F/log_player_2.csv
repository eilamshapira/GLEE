"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, I want to keep most of the money, but I'm still giving you a significant portion. Accept this and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate if this offer is fair given the inflation parameters. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my money will be worth 10% less, but for Alice, it will only be worth 5% less.

Since the inflation rate affects me more than Alice, and her current offer gives me a very small portion of the total, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was very one-sided. Given that I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%), a fair split should be more balanced. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your advantage in the negotiation due to the inflation difference while still being fair to both of us. If we continue to future rounds, we'll both lose value due to inflation.""}"
