"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation rates, I need to be strategic with my initial offer. The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get, but my inflation penalty (20% per round) is significantly higher than Bob's (5% per round). This gives me an incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. This is fair considering we both face inflation, and reaching an early agreement benefits both of us, especially me due to my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's significantly in Bob's favor. While I understand we're both facing inflation penalties, mine being more severe, a 40/60 split is too unbalanced given the circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more strategic considering the increasing inflation penalties. With each round, my position weakens more than Bob's due to my higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%).

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal 50/50 split. This is completely fair and reasonable, and continuing to negotiate further will reduce both our payoffs significantly. For me, the money is already worth 40% less than in round 1, while for Bob it's only 10% less. Let's reach a fair agreement now rather than diminishing the total value further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with the worsening inflation penalty for me, a 35/65 split is too unfavorable. Bob's offer has actually become worse than his previous offer, which doesn't show good faith in negotiation. I'll try one more time to reach a reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more pragmatic now. With each round, the inflation is significantly affecting my potential gains (my money is worth 59% less than round 1, while Bob's is only worth 18.5% less).

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm conceding more to Bob with this 45/55 split, acknowledging the stronger inflation pressure I face. This is a reasonable compromise that recognizes our different inflation rates while still being fair. Further delays will dramatically reduce what I can gain, so I hope Bob will recognize this as a fair offer that benefits us both more than continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the worsening inflation affecting me more severely than Bob, I must reject this increasingly unfair offer. Bob has moved from 60/40 to 65/35 to now 70/30, showing a pattern of increasingly exploitative offers rather than moving toward compromise. I'll try one more time with a more conciliatory offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. My money is now worth 73.8% less than in round 1, while Bob's is only worth 26.5% less. I need to be more conciliatory.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob a 60/40 split in his favor, acknowledging the reality of our different inflation rates and the diminishing value of continued negotiation. This represents a significant concession from my original position and should demonstrate my willingness to reach a reasonable agreement. Further rounds will only hurt us both, particularly me, so I hope Bob will accept this realistic compromise."
