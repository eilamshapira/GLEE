Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to avoid further inflation losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

For me, due to 5% inflation, $5000 is now worth $4750 in terms of round 1 value.
In the next round, I could propose again, but any amount I get would be worth another 5% less (so multiply by 0.9).

If I accept now: I get $4750 (in round 1 value)
If I reject and propose in round 3: Even if I managed to get $7000, it would be worth $7000 * 0.9 = $6300 in round 1 value, but Bob might reject that and we'd lose more to inflation.

Given the significant inflation risk and that Bob's offer is relatively fair, I'll accept.
