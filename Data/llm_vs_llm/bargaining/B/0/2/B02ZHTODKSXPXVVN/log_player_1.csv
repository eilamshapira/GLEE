"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

My proposal is for me (Alice) to receive $550,000 and Bob to receive $450,000. I'm offering a slightly higher portion for myself as I know I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, while I'm uncertain about Bob's inflation rate. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $480,000 with 10% inflation = $432,000 effective value
- If I reject and we continue back and forth, future rounds will have even more inflation impact
- Bob's offer, while giving him a larger share, is still relatively fair
- There's risk in rejecting as future negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable split considering the inflation impact, and prolonging negotiations would likely reduce my effective gains.
