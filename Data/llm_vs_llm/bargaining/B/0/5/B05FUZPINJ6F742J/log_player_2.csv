"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since your money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), we both benefit from agreeing quickly. This split gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in negotiation due to inflation rates. Let's avoid losing value by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Current offer: $4800 for me, $5200 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * $4800 now > ($5000-$5500) after 10% reduction
   * Alice's money only devalues 5%, giving her an advantage in later rounds

Alice is right about the inflation pressure. If I reject, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less. Even if I ask for more next round, I'd need to get significantly more to make up for the 10% loss, and Alice would likely reject such a proposal given her better inflation position.

$4800 is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. While not exactly 50-50, it's close enough given the inflation asymmetry.
