"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation pressure on both sides. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the lower inflation impact on my side. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where his potential gains would be worth 10% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6552 
# Bob gain: 3448 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's actually better for me than my initial proposal (6552 vs 6000)
2. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I'll get 6552 * 0.95 = 6224.4 effective value, which is still better than my initial proposal
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation impact, reducing the real value of any future deal
4. Bob has made a reasonable counter-offer that improves my position, showing good faith negotiation

It's a fair deal that benefits both parties, and continuing negotiation would likely reduce value for both of us due to inflation."
