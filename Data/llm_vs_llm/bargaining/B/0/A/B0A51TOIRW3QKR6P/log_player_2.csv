"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less to me
   * I can make my own proposal
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer gives me $40, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject, my $40 would be worth only $32 in the next round due to inflation. Even if I make a better proposal, Alice might reject it, leading to even more value loss.

Since there's significant risk in rejecting and the current offer is reasonable enough, I'll accept.
