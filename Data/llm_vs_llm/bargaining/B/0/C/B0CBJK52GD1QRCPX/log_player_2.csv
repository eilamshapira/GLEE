"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the effects of inflation.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,

""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm being generous given the decreasing value for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, let's adjust the split to 54-46 in my favor. This way, we both still get a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.76% less than in the first round (5% in round 1 + 4.76% in round 2 + 5% in round 3), and the money Alice gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round (20% in round 1 + 16% in round 2 + 12.8% in round 3, but since it is compounded, 20% + 20%*0.8 + 20%*0.8*0.8 = 20% + 16% + 12.8% = 48.8%). 

I'll take that into consideration for my offer.
