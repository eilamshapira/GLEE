"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Bob's 10%), I should seek a favorable first offer. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable because:
1. I face higher inflation risk (20% vs 10%)
2. Bob can counter-offer if he disagrees
3. It's a clean split that leaves both parties with significant gains"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is actually a very good offer! Let me analyze:

1. I would get 800,000$, but with 20% inflation = 800,000 * 0.8 = 640,000$ in effective value
2. This is better than my initial offer (600,000$ without inflation)
3. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise with a very generous offer
4. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation, reducing the value further
5. Bob would get 200,000 * 0.9 = 180,000$ in effective value

This is a fair offer that favors me significantly, and considering the inflation pressure, I should take it.
