"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this division is fair considering inflation impact on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me only 5% ($50,000) of the total amount ($1,000,000)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me
   - Only 5% less for Alice
   - But I get to make the proposal

This offer is clearly unfair. Even with inflation considerations, a 95-5 split is too extreme. I can make a more reasonable offer in the next round, and even with the 10% inflation impact, I should be able to secure a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is a more balanced split. Remember that if you reject, the money will be worth 5% less for you in the next round, while becoming 10% less valuable for me. Let's be efficient and agree now.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm offering a 60-40 split which is much fairer than the previous 5-95 split
2. I'm emphasizing the inflation pressure on both sides
3. The offer is generous enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting, given that:
   - If she rejects, her $400,000 would be worth only $380,000 to her next round
   - She would need to offer me something reasonable enough that I would accept despite my 10% inflation penalty
4. This creates a good balance between maximizing my gain while maintaining a high probability of acceptance"
