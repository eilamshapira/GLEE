"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since each round costs me 5% in value, it's in both our interests to finalize quickly. I look forward to your reply! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $450,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000
   * But Alice would likely reject an unfair offer
   * Plus Alice mentioned she has 5% inflation, so she might be more willing to negotiate now

$450,000 is a reasonable offer (45% of total), and the risk of losing 20% value in the next round makes accepting now more attractive than trying to negotiate for a bit more.
