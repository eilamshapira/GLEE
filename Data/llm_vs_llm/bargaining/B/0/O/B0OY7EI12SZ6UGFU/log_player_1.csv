  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. How about we split it 55-45? It's more than fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I need to factor that in. I'll offer a slightly adjusted deal to compensate.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation, I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This accounts for the reduced value of the money for me.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer still doesn't account for my loss due to inflation. I've lost 36% of the value, I need a bigger share to make up for it. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","My gains are worth almost half of what they were initially. This is getting risky. I'll try to be more accommodating, but I still need to make it worthwhile.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is hurting us both. Let's just split it 50/50 to end this now.""
