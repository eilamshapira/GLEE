"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates that Bob and I face.

Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (20% per round) than I do (10% per round), there's an incentive for him to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I should still make a fair initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller portion because of the inflation rate difference, but it's still a reasonable split that I hope he'll accept rather than moving to another round where the total value decreases for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's significantly skewed in Bob's favor, giving him 60% of the funds while I only get 40%. Even considering the different inflation rates, this division doesn't seem fair to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while trying to move toward a fair agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. Given that Bob faces a higher inflation rate (20% per round compared to my 10%), this should be appealing to him rather than continuing to another round where the total value would decrease further for both of us, but especially for him."
