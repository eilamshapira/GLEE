"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total.
If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me, so the maximum I could get would be $8,000 (worth $6,400 to me).

While this isn't a 50-50 split, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation of my share through more rounds of negotiation. Each round reduces my purchasing power by 20%, so waiting could be costly.
