"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that the money loses value each round (20% for me), it's better for both of us to make a deal now rather than going back and forth. This offer gives you a substantial $4000 while allowing me a fair share as well. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
