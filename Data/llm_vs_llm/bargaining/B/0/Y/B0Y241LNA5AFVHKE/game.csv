450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. Given that you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split in my favor. You'd still get $450000 now, which is better than $475000 devalued by inflation in later rounds. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
