"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. Given that you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split in my favor. You'd still get $450000 now, which is better than $475000 devalued by inflation in later rounds. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
