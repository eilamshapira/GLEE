"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick! I'm proposing $525000 for you and $475000 for me. This way, you get a bit more and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $525,000 (52.5%) and keeping $475,000 (47.5%) for herself. This is a fairly reasonable first offer, but I know:
1. Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I face no inflation
2. We have 11 more rounds if needed
3. If I reject, I can make the next offer

Given Alice's inflation pressure, she has incentive to make a deal sooner rather than later. Her $475,000 will be worth only $451,250 next round. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

While this is a decent offer, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's fairly reasonable first offer, I should propose something that acknowledges her initial fairness while pushing for a bit more advantage, given her inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. Given that you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split in my favor. You'd still get $450,000 now, which is better than $475,000 devalued by inflation in later rounds. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer as well, Bob. Considering the inflation I'm facing, I'd propose $465000 for me and $535000 for you. It's a fair deal since you're still getting more, and the inflation hit on my end is minimized. 
# Bob gain: 535000 
# Alice gain: 465000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $535,000 (53.5%), which is $10,000 more than her first offer
2. She's taking $465,000 (46.5%), but due to 9.75% inflation, it's worth about $419,662 to her
3. We still have 9 rounds left, but each round makes Alice's position worse
4. She's showing willingness to negotiate by increasing my share

This is a better offer than her first one, and she's clearly trying to reach a deal to avoid further inflation losses. While I might get slightly more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of reaching round 12 with no deal starts to become a factor.

Given that I'm getting a majority share and Alice has made a reasonable concession, I think it's wise to accept this offer.
