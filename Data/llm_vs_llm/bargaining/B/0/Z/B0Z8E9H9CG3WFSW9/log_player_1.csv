"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my potential gain.

*   **My potential gain:** $4500, but with 5% inflation, it's worth 0.95 * $4500 = $4275 in terms of real value.

Therefore, I will **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the cumulative effect of inflation (5% in Round 1, and 5% in Round 2).

My $1 is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the real value of the offer, considering the cumulative inflation.

*   The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means its current value is 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574 of its original value.
*   My potential gain: $5000, but with inflation, it's worth 0.8574 * $5000 = $4287 in terms of real value.

This offer is not great because I can't secure the maximum possible profit, so I will **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. The inflation has been compounding. My $1 is now worth (1 - 0.05)^4 = 0.8145 of its original value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6:

*   **Alice's potential gain:** $5200.
*   **Inflation impact:** The money I receive is worth 22.62% less than in Round 1. Therefore, the real value is (1 - 0.2262) * $5200 = 0.7738 * $5200 = $4023.76.

I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's make an offer for round 7. My money now is worth less due to inflation.

My $1 is now worth (1 - 0.05)^6 = 0.7351 of its original value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
