"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me 4000$ (40% of the total)
- She wants 6000$ (60% of the total)
- This is the first round, so I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate
- If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
- There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting isn't costly
- The split seems a bit unfair in Alice's favor

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal. I'm offering Alice 45% of the total while keeping 55% for myself. This is closer to a fair split while still giving me a slight advantage. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer, but I believe this proposal is reasonable enough that it might be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's now offering me 4500$ (up from 4000$ in round 1)
- She wants 5500$ (down from 6000$ in round 1)
- Her share is affected by 9.75% inflation, so her 5500$ is actually worth less
- My share isn't affected by inflation, so I'd get full value of 4500$
- We're in round 3 of 12, so there's still time to negotiate
- She's moving in the right direction but still keeping more for herself

Since I'm not affected by inflation and we have more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer
- She's affected by inflation (9.75% so far) while I'm not
- We still have 8 rounds left after this one
- She rejected my previous 5500/4500 split

I'll propose a split slightly more favorable to her than my last offer, but still better for me than her last proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly equal split, which should appear fair and reasonable to Alice. Given that she's affected by inflation and I'm not, she might be more inclined to accept this balanced offer rather than continue negotiating and lose more value to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:
- She's offering me 4700$ (gradually increasing from 4000$ → 4500$ → 4700$)
- She wants 5300$ (gradually decreasing from 6000$ → 5500$ → 5300$)
- Her share is now affected by 18.55% inflation, so her 5300$ is worth significantly less
- My share still has full value at 4700$
- We're in round 5 of 12, so we're nearing the halfway point
- The trend suggests she'll likely continue to make better offers

However:
- The inflation is significantly impacting her now (18.55%)
- She's showing a clear pattern of making increasingly better offers
- I'm not affected by inflation, so I can afford to wait

I'll reject this offer and see if we can get an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
- Alice has shown a consistent pattern of improving her offers
- She's now suffering from 18.55% inflation
- She's been resistant to even a 50/50 split
- We're at round 6 of 12 (halfway point)
- She needs to balance between getting a good deal and losing value to inflation

I'll propose a split that's slightly better for her than my last 50/50 offer, hoping she'll accept to avoid further inflation losses:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This offer gives Alice a small advantage in nominal terms (5200 vs 4800), which might appeal to her desire to get more than me. However, given the 18.55% inflation she's facing, she should be motivated to accept rather than risk further value loss. This is also close to her last offer (4700/5300) but slightly better for her, showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:
- She's offering me 4800$ (continuing the upward trend: 4000$ → 4500$ → 4700$ → 4800$)
- She wants 5200$ (continuing downward: 6000$ → 5500$ → 5300$ → 5200$)
- Her share is now affected by 26.49% inflation, making her 5200$ worth significantly less
- My 4800$ still maintains full value
- Interestingly, she's offering exactly the same split I just proposed (4800/5200)
- We're in round 7 of 12, more than halfway through

Given that:
1. She's matched my last proposal
2. The inflation is severely impacting her share (26.49% loss)
3. We've reached a point of convergence in our negotiations
4. Further rounds might just waste time and value for both of us
5. This is a reasonable split for me (48% of the total at full value)

I'll accept this offer.
