"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since we're already in round 2, the total value has decreased by 20%, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon before further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I propose a 40/60 split in Alice's favor. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges her position while still giving me a fair share. The total value has already decreased by almost 50% due to inflation, so we should reach an agreement now before we both lose more value."
