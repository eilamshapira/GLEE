"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation pressure on my side and the need to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because I know I face 20% inflation per round, so I need to secure a good portion now. However, I'm still offering Bob a substantial amount to increase the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $400,000 with 20% inflation, so effectively $320,000
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the next round will have 40% inflation for me
3. The longer this goes, the worse my position becomes due to inflation
4. Bob's offer is reasonable, though not ideal
5. Getting $320,000 now is better than risking further inflation
