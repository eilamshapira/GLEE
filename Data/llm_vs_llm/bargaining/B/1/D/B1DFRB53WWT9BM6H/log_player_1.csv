"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% per round) compared to my 5% loss, he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and the differential inflation rates make early agreement beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Due to inflation, if I accept:
- My $4500 is worth $4275 (95% of original value)
- Bob's $5500 is worth $4950 (90% of original value)

If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make another offer, but:
- Values will decrease further (my money to 90% and Bob's to 80% of original)
- We lose more negotiating time (only 10 rounds left)
- Risk of no agreement increases

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, it's still a reasonable split given the inflation impact, and the risk of further value deterioration makes accepting now a prudent choice.
