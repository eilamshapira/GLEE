5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for me since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%). This division is fair when accounting for that difference. Let's agree now so we both get the maximum value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. It's a fair deal considering the inflation rates.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, due to our different inflation rates (my 10% vs your 5%), an equal split actually disadvantages me more. This offer accounts for that difference while still being very fair to you. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your proposal is still too biased. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fairer and still considers your inflation rate.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. The inflation difference is real - my money loses value at twice your rate. This 51/49 split is very reasonable and close to equal. Let's resolve this now as we're both losing value with each round.",Alice,5,
