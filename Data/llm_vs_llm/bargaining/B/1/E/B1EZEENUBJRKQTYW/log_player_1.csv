"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair division of the money in the first round, considering the asymmetric inflation rates.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for me since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%). This division is fair when accounting for that difference. Let's agree now so we both get the maximum value.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. It's a fair deal considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Bob, due to our different inflation rates (my 10% vs your 5%), an equal split actually disadvantages me more. This offer accounts for that difference while still being very fair to you. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your proposal is still too biased. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fairer and still considers your inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. The inflation difference is real - my money loses value at twice your rate. This 51/49 split is very reasonable and close to equal. Let's resolve this now as we're both losing value with each round.""
