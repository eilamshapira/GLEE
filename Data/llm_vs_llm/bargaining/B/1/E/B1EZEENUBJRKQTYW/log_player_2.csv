"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for me since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%). This division is fair when accounting for that difference. Let's agree now so we both get the maximum value.

# Alice gain: 5500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to our different inflation rates (my 10% vs your 5%), an equal split actually disadvantages me more. This offer accounts for that difference while still being very fair to you. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. The inflation difference is real - my money loses value at twice your rate. This 51/49 split is very reasonable and close to equal. Let's resolve this now as we're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
