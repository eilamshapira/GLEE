Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but how about a 60/40 split? It rewards me for taking a risk in round 1. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
