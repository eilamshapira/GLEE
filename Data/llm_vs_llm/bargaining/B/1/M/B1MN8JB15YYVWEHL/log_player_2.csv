"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. This ensures we both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor to account for the potential loss of value.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value over time. This offer is reasonable, and we should settle before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer wasn't fair to me.  Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my potential gain, I need to weigh the current offer against the risk of further devaluation.

Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, the actual value of Alice's offer to me is approximately:
480000 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 388800

Given this, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less to me now. I'll make a more aggressive offer to Alice, trying to get a larger share before the value decreases further.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is slipping away. Let's settle on this offer, or I'll have to make even tougher decisions in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. The value is decreasing with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation effect, the actual value of Alice's offer to me is approximately:
500000 * 0.6561 (1 - 0.3439) = 328050

Considering the significant decrease in value and the fact that a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, I'll accept the offer to avoid further losses.
