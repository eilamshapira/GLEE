700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle this early. Since my share loses 20% value every round, itâ€™s best for both of us to agree now. I propose I receive $700000 while you get $300000. This guarantees you $300000 immediately without waiting for potential risks in later rounds. What do you say?",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's not risk further devaluation - this offer gives us both $500000 right now. It's fair and reasonable.",Bob,2,
