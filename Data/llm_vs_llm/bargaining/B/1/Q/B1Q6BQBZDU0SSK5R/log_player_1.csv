"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this early. Since my share loses 20% value every round, itâ€™s best for both of us to agree now. I propose I receive $700,000 while you get $300,000. This guarantees you $300,000 immediately without waiting for potential risks in later rounds. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's not risk further devaluation - this offer gives us both $500000 right now. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
