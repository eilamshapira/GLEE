"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this early. Since my share loses 20% value every round, itâ€™s best for both of us to agree now. I propose I receive $700000 while you get $300000. This guarantees you $300000 immediately without waiting for potential risks in later rounds. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $300,000 for me and $700,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, my future gains will be worth 20% less each round
3. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer
4. Current split is 30-70 in Alice's favor

This initial offer seems quite unfavorable to me. While it's true that inflation will affect future rounds, Alice's opening offer is too greedy. Since I'll be making the next offer and only one round of inflation will have occurred (meaning I'll still have 80% of the value), I can try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's not risk further devaluation - this offer gives us both $500,000 right now. It's fair and reasonable.""}"
