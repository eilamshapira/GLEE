55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs. your 10% per round). If we delay, we both lose value - especially me. This offer gives us both a good amount without risking depreciation.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, given the increased impact of inflation on both of us, especially you, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Since we've already lost value, it's important to settle soon. This offer still gives you a significant amount while accounting for the urgency to conclude the game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, I'm offering an even 50-50 split. We've both lost value already - my money is now worth 36% less than the original amount, and yours is 19% less. Continuing to delay hurts us both, especially me. This fair split respects both our interests and avoids further losses. Let's conclude the game with this balanced division.",Alice,3,
