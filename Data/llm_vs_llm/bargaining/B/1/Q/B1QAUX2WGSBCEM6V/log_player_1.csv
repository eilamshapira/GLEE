"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs. your 10% per round). If we delay, we both lose value - especially me. This offer gives us both a good amount without risking depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the increased impact of inflation on both of us, especially you, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Since we've already lost value, it's important to settle soon. This offer still gives you a significant amount while accounting for the urgency to conclude the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering an even 50-50 split. We've both lost value already - my money is now worth 36% less than the original amount, and yours is 19% less. Continuing to delay hurts us both, especially me. This fair split respects both our interests and avoids further losses. Let's conclude the game with this balanced division.""}"
