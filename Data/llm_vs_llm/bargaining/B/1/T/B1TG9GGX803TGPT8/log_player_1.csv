"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that waiting costs you: with each round your money loses 20% of its value, while mine stays fully intact. I’m offering you $200000 now—more valuable than the depreciated amount you’d secure later. I believe this is a fair compromise given the incentives at play. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $400,000 for me and $600,000 for you. This is still a generous offer given the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more value.""
