"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that waiting costs you: with each round your money loses 20% of its value, while mine stays fully intact. I’m offering you $200,000 now—more valuable than the depreciated amount you’d secure later. I believe this is a fair compromise given the incentives at play. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $400000 for me and $600000 for you. This is still a generous offer given the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
