I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and leaving 100,000$ for Bob. It's a fair offer, considering I'm taking the risk of starting the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
