Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to concede a little, but I'm taking a significant hit from inflation each round. Let's get this done. This is a better deal for you than my last offer, and still leaves me with enough to make it worth it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
