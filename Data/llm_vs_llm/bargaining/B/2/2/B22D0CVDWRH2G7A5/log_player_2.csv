"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice
   * I could propose a better split for myself
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

While the split isn't perfectly even, getting $40 now is better than risking further devaluation. If I reject, and Alice later rejects my counter-offer, we could both end up with less value.
