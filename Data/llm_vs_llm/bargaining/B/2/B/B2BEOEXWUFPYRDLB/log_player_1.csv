"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different situations. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round while you don't, a 60-40 split acknowledges this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so this is the most efficient outcome for both of us.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation penalty you face, I'm making a generous offer. If you accept, we both get a significant amount. However, if you decline, the value for you will decrease substantially in the next round, while I won't be affected. It's in your best interest to accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer to Bob, accounting for the increasing inflation pressure.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Your previous offer of $3000 to me was too low. Remember, while I face inflation penalties, I still have the power to reject unfair offers. This equal split respects both our positions. If we continue to the next round, I'll have to ask for more to offset further inflation, which would mean less for you. This is the optimal compromise for both of us.""
