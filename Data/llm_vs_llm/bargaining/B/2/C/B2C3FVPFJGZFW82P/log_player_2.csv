"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total sum ($4000)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
4. In the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me
5. Even if I could get a better split next round, I'd need to get significantly more to overcome the 10% inflation

While 40% isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations reducing the overall value, I think it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
