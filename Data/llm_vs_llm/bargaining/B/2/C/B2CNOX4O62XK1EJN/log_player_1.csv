"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in future rounds, and you lose less than I do per round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's a fairer distribution considering the inflation we both face, and it gives you a better deal than the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 10% less than round 1, so effectively $4050
* If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
* My previous offer of $6000 would only be worth $4800 in the next round due to inflation
* Bob's current offer of $4050 (after inflation) is better than what I might get in future rounds due to increasing inflation
