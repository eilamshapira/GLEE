"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000."" 
}
```

This offer seems fair at the start, with Alice getting a larger share but leaving a significant amount for Bob. It will be interesting to see how Bob values the money with the inflation element unknown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more balanced split is fair. Let's go with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was more than fair.  I'm taking a small hit with this one, but let's close this deal.""
}
```

This offer takes a harder line with Bob. While appearing to concede slightly, Alice is emphasizing that time is running out and they both lose if they don't reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about $5200 for me and $4800 for you? Let's settle this soon. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but Alice is losing money rapidly with each round.  While risky, rejecting this offer shows Bob that Alice is serious about getting a fair deal and won't be pressured into a bad one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another hit here to get this done. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This is a firm offer.  Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but is also conveying the urgency of the situation.  The message is clear: Bob is jeopardizing both of their chances of gaining anything by continuing to be difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this on a fair note. How about an even split of $5000 each? It's time we conclude this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting a $5000 split is the most logical choice at this point. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better, and the value of the money for Alice will continue to decrease with each passing round. Taking the sure $5000 is preferable to risking getting nothing at all."
