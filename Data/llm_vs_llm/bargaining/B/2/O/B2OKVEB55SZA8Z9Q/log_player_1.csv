"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob faces a 10% depreciation each round while I don't, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer early. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive in the first round.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial amount while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Let me explain my proposal to Bob: ""I propose a 60-40 split, which gives you $400,000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 10% less next round. This is a fair offer that gives you significant value without delay."""
