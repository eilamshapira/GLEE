"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by offering a fair division that considers the inflation factor for Bob. Since Bob's money loses 5% of its value in each round, he might be incentivized to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is fair and respects both of our interests equally. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, accepting this fair division now would be advantageous for him."
