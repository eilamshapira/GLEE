"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. Let's avoid dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and ensures neither of us is disadvantaged by inflation. Let's agree on this and end the game quickly to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, $5000 now is worth $4000 to me.
This offer is actually worse for me than my initial proposal would have been for Bob.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising from my initial position. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5%, this 55-45 split is actually very fair. If we continue further, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation rates, a 52-48 split in my favor seems fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

With 48.8% inflation for me, $4800 would be worth approximately $2458 in real value to me.
The game is progressing and inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains.
While this isn't an ideal offer, continuing the game would mean even more value lost to inflation.
