Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. Let's avoid dragging this out.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the inflation factor, I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Let's consider this for the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising from my initial position. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5%, this 55-45 split is actually very fair. If we continue further, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: ""Alice, I understand your situation, but given the inflation rates, I think a 52-48 split in my favor would be more equitable. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation. Let's settle this in the next round."""
