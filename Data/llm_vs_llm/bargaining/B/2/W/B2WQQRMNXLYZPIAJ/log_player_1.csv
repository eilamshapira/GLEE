"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 10% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the million dollars. This is a fair and equitable division that should be acceptable to Bob. If he rejects this offer, we'll both risk losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $400,000 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $360,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. Bob's position is stronger as he's not affected by inflation
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds

Given these factors, while this isn't as good as my initial offer, it's better to accept now than risk further value loss.
