"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 while she takes $60. While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (the money is worth 0% less with each passing round), I don't lose anything by continuing to negotiate. However, I also don't know if Alice faces inflation penalties, which might give me leverage in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but slightly better for me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money evenly. A 50-50 split is the fairest division and allows us both to walk away with a good outcome. This balanced approach respects both our interests equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has improved her offer by $5 in my favor compared to her first offer. Now she's offering me $45 while she takes $55. I also notice that Alice is facing an inflation penalty - her money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, but mine isn't affected by inflation.

Given that:
1. Alice has moved closer to an even split
2. Alice is facing inflation penalties that will continue to grow
3. I don't face any inflation penalty, so I don't lose value by continuing

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is facing increasing inflation penalties and I'm not, I'll adjust my offer slightly in my favor while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and you receive $45. I've noticed you're facing inflation penalties that increase with each round, while I'm not. This offer gives you a substantial portion now before further inflation reduces the value for you. It's a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away with a good outcome rather than continuing to negotiate."
