"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's quite unfair - I'd only get 20% of the total amount. Since the inflation rate affects Alice more strongly (20% vs my 10%), I have a good negotiating position to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering that Alice's inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (10%), so she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This split gives her a significant portion while recognizing my stronger negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less now due to inflation (19% less for me), Alice's offer of 36% is still too low. Given that she faces higher inflation (36% loss already), she should be more motivated to reach a fair agreement. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm slightly lowering my demands from my previous offer (60-40) to 55-45 to show willingness to compromise. This is still a fair offer considering:
1. Alice's inflation rate (20% per round) is higher than mine (10% per round)
2. The money is already worth significantly less for both of us
3. We need to reach an agreement to avoid both getting nothing
This should be an attractive offer for Alice given her higher inflation pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Given that:
1. The money is already worth 34.39% less for me and 59.04% less for Alice
2. Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer (20-80) to a much more balanced split (48-52)
3. We're already in round 5, and continuing to negotiate would mean even more value lost to inflation
4. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

This is now a reasonable split that's close to 50-50, and accepting it now is better than risking further value loss through inflation."
