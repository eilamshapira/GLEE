"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game and the declining value of the money for both of us. I need to factor in the inflation rates (20% for me, 5% for Bob) and the risk of further inflation in subsequent rounds. I'll try to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, given the circumstances.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a slightly larger share upfront, recognizing that the value of money is eroding faster for me than for Bob. I believe this offer is still reasonable enough that Bob will accept it rather than risk further losses in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer, and now the money's value has further eroded for both of us. Let's analyze this:

*   **Original Value:** $100

*   **My Inflation:** 20% per round

*   **Bob's Inflation:** 5% per round

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $40, Bob gets $60.

Before making a decision, I need to calculate the actual value of the offer to me, considering the inflation. The money is worth 20% less, so I'll receive $40 * 0.8 = $32 in value.

Is $32 enough to make me accept, rather than risk another round of 20% inflation? I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
