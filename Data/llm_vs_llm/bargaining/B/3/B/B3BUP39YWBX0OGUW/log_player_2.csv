"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split $100 with me getting $60 and you getting $40. Keep in mind that with each round, the money loses 10% value for me due to inflation, so it's beneficial for both of us to agree quickly. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains while avoiding unnecessary delays. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
