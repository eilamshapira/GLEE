"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I know that:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't
3. This means Alice has more incentive to accept a deal sooner rather than later

Given this, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a split more favorable to me in the next round. Alice will be more likely to accept since her share would be worth less if she rejects.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me. If Alice rejects, her share in the next round will be worth 5% less to her. She should rationally accept a deal now rather than risk getting less value later.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me a better deal while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it, considering her time pressure due to depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased my share to $5,500 (55%) and reduced hers to $4,500 (45%)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $4,500 is actually worth only about $4,061 to her
3. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will depreciate further (by 15%)
   - I might be able to get an even better deal

However, this is actually a pretty reasonable offer considering:
1. I'm getting more than half
2. Alice has shown willingness to compromise
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept an even more aggressive offer from me
4. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a worse outcome if Alice decides to play hardball

I'll accept this offer.
