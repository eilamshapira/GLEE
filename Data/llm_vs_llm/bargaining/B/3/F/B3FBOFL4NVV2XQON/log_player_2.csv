"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject:
- I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me
- The $1M will effectively be worth $900K to me in the next round
- Alice's inflation rate is only 5%, giving her an advantage in later rounds

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me. A guaranteed $400K now might be better than risking a lower effective amount later.

$400K now vs. potential for slightly more but worth 10% less next round... I think I should accept this offer.
