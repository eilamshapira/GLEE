550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450000 while I take $550000. This split is fair when considering our different inflation rates - yours is 10% per round while mine is only 5%. If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our total gain.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle on $500000 each to ensure we both get a reasonable amount before the value decreases further.",Bob,2,

570000.0,430000.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for 50-50, but we need to consider the inflation rates. You lose 10% per round, I lose 5%. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly. At this point, your $430000 is worth $387000 in original value due to two rounds of 10% inflation. Let's not lose more value - this is a fair split considering our different inflation positions.",Alice,3,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I still believe we should aim for a more balanced split. Given the current situation, I propose $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact, and we can end this game sooner rather than later. What do you say?",Bob,4,
