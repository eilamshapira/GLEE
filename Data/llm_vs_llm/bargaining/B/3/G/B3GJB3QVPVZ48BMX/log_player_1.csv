"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450,000 while I take $550,000. This split is fair when considering our different inflation rates - yours is 10% per round while mine is only 5%. If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our total gain.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle on $500000 each to ensure we both get a reasonable amount before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, 
""bob_gain"": 430000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for 50-50, but we need to consider the inflation rates. You lose 10% per round, I lose 5%. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly. At this point, your $430,000 is worth $387,000 in original value due to two rounds of 10% inflation. Let's not lose more value - this is a fair split considering our different inflation positions.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I still believe we should aim for a more balanced split. Given the current situation, I propose $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact, and we can end this game sooner rather than later.
