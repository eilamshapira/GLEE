"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450000 while I take $550000. This split is fair when considering our different inflation rates - yours is 10% per round while mine is only 5%. If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our total gain. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle on $500,000 each to ensure we both get a reasonable amount before the value decreases further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for 50-50, but we need to consider the inflation rates. You lose 10% per round, I lose 5%. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly. At this point, your $430000 is worth $387000 in original value due to two rounds of 10% inflation. Let's not lose more value - this is a fair split considering our different inflation positions. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I still believe we should aim for a more balanced split. Given the current situation, I propose $480,000 for me and $520,000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact, and we can end this game sooner rather than later. What do you say?""
