"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end early!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's both have an equal share, itâ€™s fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000
Bob gain: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000

Considering this, I think it's a reasonable offer.
