"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

Let me think about this. In the first round, I need to make a compelling offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob in each passing round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, but especially for me.

I'll propose a division that's fair but also acknowledges the asymmetric inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think strategically here. Bob rejected my first offer of 55/45, and I rejected his counter of 40/60. Now we're in round 3, and inflation is impacting both of us, but me more significantly.

For me, the money is now worth only 64% of its original value (after two 20% reductions). For Bob, it's worth about 90% (after two 5% reductions).

I need to make an offer that's reasonable given our different inflation rates and the fact that we both seem willing to negotiate.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even split this time, which is fair and should be more appealing to Bob than my first offer, while still giving me a reasonable amount considering the inflation effects."
