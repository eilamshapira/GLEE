"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to agree quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's more favorable to me but still gives Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob rejects, his next round value will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less
3. It's a clean split that's easy to understand"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For me, $4500 with 5% inflation means I'd effectively get $4,275
2. If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth another 5% less
3. The offer is relatively fair (45-55 split)
4. We still have many rounds left, but the money's value is declining each round
5. Bob's higher inflation rate (10%) means he's more pressured to reach a deal

While I could reject and try for a better deal, the inflation risk and the reasonable split make this acceptable.
