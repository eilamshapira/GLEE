"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an even splitâ€”$5,000 each. By agreeing now, we both secure a fair share of the money without risking further depreciation (at least for me). Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my end, I'd like to propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This helps me mitigate some of the risks. I hope you find this acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
