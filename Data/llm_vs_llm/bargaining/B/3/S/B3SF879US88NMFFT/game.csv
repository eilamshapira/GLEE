60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose to split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's settle quickly to avoid any further complications or inflation effects. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Let's be more fair about this. I propose a 55-45 split. It's a better deal for both of us than risking further inflation.,Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe there's room for a fairer split that reflects the fact that my portion retains full value while yours is already discounted. I'm thus opting to reject this round's offer, and I'll make my proposal in round 3.",Alice,2,reject
41.0,59.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Given that waiting further only compounds the inflation effect on your share (making your money worth roughly 10% less than its original value by now), I'm offering you a nominal $59 – which translates to an effective value of about $53.10. While I receive $41 at full value, this deal ensures you secure a higher effective amount than if we drag this out. Accepting now safeguards both our interests before further devaluation hits. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Inflation is eating into my share, so let's split it 50-50 now and ensure we both get a fair amount before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while a 50-50 split might seem fair on the surface, remember that your portion is already discounted by about 14.26% compared to its original value. Accepting now would give me a full $50 while your effective amount would be closer to $42.87. I believe that by moving into the next round, I can propose a division that better reflects the shifting value and may still leave you with a share that compensates for the inflation. So, I must reject this offer and look forward to putting forward my proposal in round 5.",Alice,4,reject
33.0,67.0,"Hi Bob, in round 5 the inflation has further reduced the value of your nominal dollars—your share is now about 20% less than its face value while mine remain undiminished. With this in mind, I'm proposing that you receive $67 (which effectively becomes roughly $53.60 for you) and I get $33. This offer gives you an effective value that marginally exceeds your best previous deal and avoids the risk of even harsher depreciation in future rounds. Let’s lock this in before further losses occur. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
42.0,58.0,"I'm feeling the pinch from inflation, so I'll give you a slightly better deal than before. Let's settle on 58-42, or I fear we'll both lose out if we wait longer.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to adjust for inflation, but let's look at the numbers: in your proposal I get $42 at full value, while your $58 is worth about $58 × 0.7738 ≈ $44.9 effective. In an ideal balance accounting for the discount, an equal effective split would give me roughly $43.6. Your offer still leaves me at a disadvantage. To ensure our shares are balanced considering the inflation on your side, I'm going to reject this offer and put forward my proposal in round 7.",Alice,6,reject
41.0,59.0,"Hi Bob, considering that your share is now discounted by 30% due to inflation, I'm proposing a nominal split of $41 for me and $59 for you. In effect, you'll receive about $59 × 0.70 ≈ $41.3, which is almost equal to my full $41. This deal secures both our positions and prevents further erosion of the value of your portion. I believe this is a fair and urgent proposal given the current conditions. What do you think?",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
48.0,52.0,"Inflation is really hurting my side now. I'm willing to compromise - let's do a 52-48 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than waiting and losing even more value.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, your offer recognizes the inflation impact on your side. With a nominal split of $48 for me (at full value) and $52 for you (effectively about $36.30), the deal is favourable considering the circumstances. I'm happy to lock this in rather than risk further devaluation. Let's settle at 52-48.",Alice,8,accept
