Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Given that waiting further only compounds the inflation effect on your share (making your money worth roughly 10% less than its original value by now), I'm offering you a nominal $59 – which translates to an effective value of about $53.10. While I receive $41 at full value, this deal ensures you secure a higher effective amount than if we drag this out. Accepting now safeguards both our interests before further devaluation hits. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 59 
# Alice gain: 41

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the inflation has further reduced the value of your nominal dollars—your share is now about 20% less than its face value while mine remain undiminished. With this in mind, I'm proposing that you receive $67 (which effectively becomes roughly $53.60 for you) and I get $33. This offer gives you an effective value that marginally exceeds your best previous deal and avoids the risk of even harsher depreciation in future rounds. Let’s lock this in before further losses occur. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 67 
# Alice gain: 33

""alice_gain"": 42,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that your share is now discounted by 30% due to inflation, I'm proposing a nominal split of $41 for me and $59 for you. In effect, you'll receive about $59 × 0.70 ≈ $41.3, which is almost equal to my full $41. This deal secures both our positions and prevents further erosion of the value of your portion. I believe this is a fair and urgent proposal given the current conditions. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 41
