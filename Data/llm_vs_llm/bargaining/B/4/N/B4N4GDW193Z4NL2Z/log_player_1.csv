"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is close to an even split but gives me a small buffer against potential inflation if Bob rejects and we need another round. It's a reasonable starting offer that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $4,500 with 5% inflation, so effectively $4,275
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Given that Bob's money is worth 20% less, his $5,500 is effectively worth $4,400 to him
4. This offer is reasonably fair considering the inflation effects, and going another round will reduce the value further for both of us
