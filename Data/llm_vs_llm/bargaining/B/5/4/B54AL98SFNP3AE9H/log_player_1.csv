I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 70/30 split, with me receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still factoring in the impact of inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 450000

Round 5

I'm offering a 65/35 split, with me receiving $650,000 and Bob receiving $350,000. This is another compromise,  but with the rate of inflation, I need to ensure I receive a fair share."
