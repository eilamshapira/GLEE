"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round. 100,000$ is too low for a fair split of 1 million dollars."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This way, both of us can benefit equally from this opportunity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since Alice's money is worth 36% less due to inflation, her $700,000 is effectively worth only $448,000 now. My $300,000 offer is still too low for a fair split. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes this inflation into account."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

Given that Alice faces 36% inflation on her gains, I'm offering her a slightly larger portion ($550,000) to help compensate for her inflation losses while still ensuring I receive a fair share ($450,000). This adjusted split should be more appealing considering the inflation effects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Given that Alice's money is now worth 59.04% less due to inflation, her $650,000 is effectively worth only about $266,240, while my $350,000 maintains its full value. This makes the real economic split more favorable to me than the nominal amounts suggest. Additionally, with the rapidly increasing inflation affecting Alice's share, it's better to secure a deal now rather than risk further rounds."
