9000.0,1000.0,Let's keep it simple. I'll take $9000 and you get $1000. It's a fair start!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most rational solution for both of us.,Bob,2,
