Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most rational solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
