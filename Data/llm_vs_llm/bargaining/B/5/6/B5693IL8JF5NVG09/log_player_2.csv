"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple. I'll take $9000 and you get $1000. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfavorable for me. Getting only 10% of the total amount ($1000 out of $10,000) is not a fair division. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most rational solution for both of us.""}"
