"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me each round. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Rationale: I'm aiming for a relatively generous split in the first round to increase the chances of Bob accepting. While it might seem like I'm giving away a lot, it's better to secure a good portion now before inflation hits me hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My $6000 in round 1 would have been worth more than $4000 now. Let's calculate the worth of $4000 with 20% less value. It's equal to $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 worth in round 1.

Comparing to my offer of $6000 in round 1, $3200 is much less. Therefore, I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. The value of money for me is now 40% less than in round 1.

I need to make an offer that is attractive to Bob, but also gives me a reasonable amount considering the inflation. I will try to offer Bob slightly more than what he offered me, but still retain a significant portion for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Rationale: I'm offering Bob slightly more than his previous offer, which might entice him to accept. I'm still keeping a majority of the money, which, adjusted for inflation (now 40% less), is still a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. My money is now worth 48.8% less. Bob is offering me $3500. To calculate its equivalent value in round 1, I need to divide $3500 by (1 - 0.488) = $3500 / 0.512 = $6835.94 approximately.

Compared to my original offer of $6000, this is a better value *in round 1 dollars*. I also need to consider that we're already in round 4. While I'd prefer more, time is running out.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
