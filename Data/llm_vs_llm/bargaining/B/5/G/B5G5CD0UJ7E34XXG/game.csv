68.97,31.03,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you get $31.03. Given the 5% depreciation for me and 10% for you in later rounds, waiting further will only decrease the value you receive. Accepting now maximizes both our outcomes.",Alice,1,

93.0,7.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 every dollar counts even more because of inflation. If you reject this offer, your next chance as proposer in round 4 will force you to make a generous concession to me – leaving you with an effective value much lower than what I’m offering now. I’m offering you $7 (which at 80% value gives you $5.60 in real terms), while I get $93 (worth $83.70). I believe this is a fair deal given how much value we would both lose by delaying further. Let’s settle now.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is final.  We both lose more money with every round we delay. Let's get this done!",Bob,4,
