Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you get $31.03. Given the 5% depreciation for me and 10% for you in later rounds, waiting further will only decrease the value you receive. Accepting now maximizes both our outcomes.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 93,
  ""bob_gain"": 7,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 every dollar counts even more because of inflation. If you reject this offer, your next chance as proposer in round 4 will force you to make a generous concession to me – leaving you with an effective value much lower than what I’m offering now. I’m offering you $7 (which at 80% value gives you $5.60 in real terms), while I get $93 (worth $83.70). I believe this is a fair deal given how much value we would both lose by delaying further. Let’s settle now.""
