"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you get $31.03. Given the 5% depreciation for me and 10% for you in later rounds, waiting further will only decrease the value you receive. Accepting now maximizes both our outcomes. 
# Bob gain: 31.03 
# Alice gain: 68.97

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 every dollar counts even more because of inflation. If you reject this offer, your next chance as proposer in round 4 will force you to make a generous concession to me – leaving you with an effective value much lower than what I’m offering now. I’m offering you $7 (which at 80% value gives you $5.60 in real terms), while I get $93 (worth $83.70). I believe this is a fair deal given how much value we would both lose by delaying further. Let’s settle now. 
# Bob gain: 7 
# Alice gain: 93
