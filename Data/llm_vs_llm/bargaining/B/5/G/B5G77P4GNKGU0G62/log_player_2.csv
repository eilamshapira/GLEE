Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, accepting $1 is a terrible deal. There's a slim chance I can still get Alice to agree to a more reasonable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is my final offer. It's fair and accounts for the fact that the game could go on indefinitely, hurting both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 50

It seems Alice was holding out to see if I'd accept a worse deal. Even with inflation, this is a fair offer and it's better to take it now than risk further losses."
