5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it reasonably. I'm offering a slightly larger share to account for the inflation I'll face if we delay.,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I propose a fair 50-50 split. The instructions state I face 0% inflation, so there's no cost to me for negotiating. If you're truly facing inflation, let's reach a fair agreement quickly - an even split seems most reasonable.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting me. How about I take 5200, you take 4800? It's still very fair, and compensates me a little for the diminishing value of money for me. It will only get worse for me if we delay more.",Alice,3,
