"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I propose a fair 50-50 split. The instructions state I face 0% inflation, so there's no cost to me for negotiating. If you're truly facing inflation, let's reach a fair agreement quickly - an even split seems most reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
