"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it reasonably. I'm offering a slightly larger share to account for the inflation I'll face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. She's claiming she needs more to account for inflation, but the instructions indicate there's no inflation effect for me (0% less value with each round). She hasn't provided evidence that she faces inflation either.

Since I'll be able to make a counteroffer in the next round with no penalty to me, I should reject this initial offer and propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I propose a fair 50-50 split. The instructions state I face 0% inflation, so there's no cost to me for negotiating. If you're truly facing inflation, let's reach a fair agreement quickly - an even split seems most reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting me. How about I take 5200, you take 4800? It's still very fair, and compensates me a little for the diminishing value of money for me. It will only get worse for me if we delay more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is now claiming inflation is affecting her, and I can now see that the instructions mention she may be affected by inflation differently than I am. Her current offer gives me $4,800 which is better than her first offer of $4,500, and she's reduced her request from $5,500 to $5,200.

This is more reasonable, and if inflation is truly affecting her by 19% already (as stated in this round's information), further delays might lead to even less favorable offers from her perspective. A 48/52 split is fairly close to equal, and accepting now would conclude the negotiation.
