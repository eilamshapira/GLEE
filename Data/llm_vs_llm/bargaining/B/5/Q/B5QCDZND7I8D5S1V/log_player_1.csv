Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,""bob_gain"": 40,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I get 60%, you get 40%. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that we split the $100 as $55 for you and $45 for me. With delays, my share loses value, and while I don't know your rate of decline, acting now ensures we both secure a decent value without further erosion. Let's agree today and avoid the discount penalty in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
