Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose that we split the $100 as $55 for you and $45 for me. With delays, my share loses value, and while I don't know your rate of decline, acting now ensures we both secure a decent value without further erosion. Let's agree today and avoid the discount penalty in future rounds.""}"
