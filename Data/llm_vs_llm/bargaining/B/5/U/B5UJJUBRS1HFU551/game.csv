915000.0,85000.0,"Hi Bob – to avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds, I propose we settle now. I’m offering you $85000 and keeping $915000 for myself. This offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect by waiting (since as proposer next round the devaluation would leave you around $80000 in effective value). Let’s close this deal today!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Let's aim for a fairer split. Considering the devaluation, this offer provides a more balanced division of the funds. It's in both our interests to agree on a split that reflects the game's dynamics and the diminishing value of the money over time.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s current offer gives me an effective 405000 in round‑1 dollars (450000 × 0.9) while his proposal values his own share at 440000 in round‑1 terms (550000 × 0.8). Given my slower rate of devaluation compared to Bob (10% per round for me vs. 20% for him), I stand to gain more by moving into the next round as the proposer. I believe I can craft an offer that leverages my relative patience, which should yield a better outcome for me in equilibrium. Therefore, I must reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Hi Bob – by rejecting this round, you’d only secure about $57000 in first‐round value in the next round. To avoid further inflation losses (remember, in Round 3 my dollars are worth 80% and yours 60% of nominal), I'm offering you $100000, which nets you roughly $60000 effective value now – a slight improvement over your alternative. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,
