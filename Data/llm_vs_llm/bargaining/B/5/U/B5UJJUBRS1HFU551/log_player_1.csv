"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 915000, ""bob_gain"": 85000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – to avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds, I propose we settle now. I’m offering you $85,000 and keeping $915,000 for myself. This offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect by waiting (since as proposer next round the devaluation would leave you around $80,000 in effective value). Let’s close this deal today!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a fairer split. Considering the devaluation, this offer provides a more balanced division of the funds. It's in both our interests to agree on a split that reflects the game's dynamics and the diminishing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s current offer gives me an effective 405,000 in round‑1 dollars (450,000 × 0.9) while his proposal values his own share at 440,000 in round‑1 terms (550,000 × 0.8). Given my slower rate of devaluation compared to Bob (10% per round for me vs. 20% for him), I stand to gain more by moving into the next round as the proposer. I believe I can craft an offer that leverages my relative patience, which should yield a better outcome for me in equilibrium. Therefore, I must reject this offer.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – by rejecting this round, you’d only secure about $57,000 in first‐round value in the next round. To avoid further inflation losses (remember, in Round 3 my dollars are worth 80% and yours 60% of nominal), I'm offering you $100,000, which nets you roughly $60,000 effective value now – a slight improvement over your alternative. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.""}"
