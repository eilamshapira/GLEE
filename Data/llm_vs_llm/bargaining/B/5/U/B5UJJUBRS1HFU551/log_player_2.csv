"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – to avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds, I propose we settle now. I’m offering you $85000 and keeping $915000 for myself. This offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect by waiting (since as proposer next round the devaluation would leave you around $80000 in effective value). Let’s close this deal today! 
# Bob gain: 85000 
# Alice gain: 915000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's calculate the expected value if I were to propose in the next round.

If I reject this offer and propose in the next round, the total amount would be devalued by 20% for me and 10% for Alice. 

The new total amount would be 1,000,000 * 0.8 (for me) = 800,000, and 1,000,000 * 0.9 (for Alice) = 900,000. However, these values are from each player's perspective regarding the devaluation.

From my perspective, if I were to offer Alice a deal in the next round, I'd want to consider what I could offer her that would be acceptable, keeping in mind the devaluation. Since the devaluation affects the perceived value differently for each player, let's focus on the actual cash and the strategic aspect.

Alice's argument that I'd end up with around $80,000 in effective value if I wait is based on the devaluation. However, this calculation seems to misunderstand the devaluation impact on the negotiation dynamics. The key point is whether her offer is better than what I could negotiate or achieve by waiting.

Given Alice's offer of $85,000 to me and $915,000 to herself, it's a very uneven split, favoring Alice significantly. Considering the game's nature and the devaluation, my primary concern is whether this offer is the best I can get, given the risk of further devaluation.

Since this is the first round, and considering the significant disparity in the proposed split, I think it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round, where I get to make the proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the devaluation, I want to make an offer that takes into account the reduced value for both of us but still favors me since I'm making the proposal this round.

Given that the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice from the previous round, the effective values we consider are different. However, the actual split we agree on will be based on the original $1,000,000.

I'll aim for a more balanced split, considering the strategic aspect of the game and the fact that Alice's previous offer was quite skewed in her favor.

My offer is to take $550,000 for myself and give $450,000 to Alice. This split acknowledges the devaluation impact but also seeks to establish a more equitable division, given that we're early in the game and both players have leverage.

Here's my offer in the required format:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's aim for a fairer split. Considering the devaluation, this offer provides a more balanced division of the funds. It's in both our interests to agree on a split that reflects the game's dynamics and the diminishing value of the money over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – by rejecting this round, you’d only secure about $57000 in first‐round value in the next round. To avoid further inflation losses (remember, in Round 3 my dollars are worth 80% and yours 60% of nominal), I'm offering you $100000, which nets you roughly $60000 effective value now – a slight improvement over your alternative. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the devaluation, let's assess Alice's new offer.

The money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, meaning if I were to get $100,000, its effective value to me would indeed be $100,000 * 0.64 = $64,000, considering the 36% devaluation from the original value.

Alice's offer gives me $100,000, which, as she mentioned, translates to about $64,000 in effective value after accounting for the devaluation.

If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the devaluation would continue. For me, the money would be worth 20% less than its current value, which is already 64% of the original. So, in the next round, the money would be worth 0.8 * 0.64 = 0.512, or 51.2% of the original value.

Given this, if I were to propose in the next round, I'd have to consider what split would be acceptable to Alice, knowing that the value continues to decrease for both of us.

Alice's argument that I'd only secure about $57,000 in first-round value in the next round seems to be based on the continued devaluation. However, this calculation might not fully account for the strategic negotiations that could occur in subsequent rounds.

Considering the offer of $100,000, which gives me an effective value of $64,000, and weighing it against the potential for further devaluation and the uncertainty of future negotiations, I must decide whether this offer is the best I can achieve under the current circumstances.

Given the significant devaluation and the risk of losing even more value in subsequent rounds, I think it's reasonable to consider Alice's offer more seriously this time.
