"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm happy to negotiate if you have a better idea. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. This way we both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle with 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than what I would get if I rejected it and made my own offer in round 4, even after accounting for the inflation."
