"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me, considering I need to make an attractive offer but also account for the possibility of future rounds with inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give $45 to Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself. If Bob declines, the 5% inflation will affect my next potential gains."
