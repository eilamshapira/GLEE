"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning my money will be worth less. 

If I reject and offer a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $50 but with 10% inflation, making it effectively worth $45. That's the same as what I'm being offered now without the risk of further negotiation.
