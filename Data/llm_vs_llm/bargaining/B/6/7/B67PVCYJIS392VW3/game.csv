5000.0,995000.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. Remember, every passing round reduces the value of your share (now by about 27% compared to round 1). If you reject, you'll be forced into a position where I can dictate almost everything in round 5. Accept this offer now: you get $5000 (worth roughly $3645 in today’s terms) rather than risking nearly zero later.",Bob,4,

20000.0,980000.0,"Alice, with every round that passes your share loses more of its value—by now it's only worth about 59% of its face value. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 7, but by then you'll be forced to concede nearly everything to Bob to get him to agree, leaving you with even less. I'm offering you $20000 nominal (about $11800 in today’s value) to avoid further losses. Accept this offer now.",Bob,6,

470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, we're now in round 8 and the clock is truly against you—each round further erodes the real value of your share. At this point, your money is worth only half its face value. If you push on into round 9, the depreciation will only deepen, and your effective gain will drop further. By accepting my offer of $470000 for you (and $530000 for me), you're locking in an effective value of about $235000, which is likely better than what you could secure later. I believe this is a pragmatic, fair resolution given our circumstances. Please accept this offer.",Bob,8,
