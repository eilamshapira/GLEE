I'm offering you $20,000 nominal (about $11,800 in today’s value) to avoid further losses. Accept this offer now.""}"

At this point, your money is worth only half its face value. If you push on into round 9, the depreciation will only deepen, and your effective gain will drop further. By accepting my offer of $470,000 for you (and $530,000 for me), you're locking in an effective value of about $235,000, which is likely better than what you could secure later. I believe this is a pragmatic, fair resolution given our circumstances. Please accept this offer.""}"
