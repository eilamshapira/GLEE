600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation losses.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I mitigate some of the inflation risk. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% inflation impact I'm already facing, I need to secure a reasonable amount. I'm offering you a very fair 45%, which is $450000. This is better than risking further rounds where we both lose value. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 27.1% for me, I need to adjust our split to 60-40 in my favor. This proposal still gives you a substantial amount while allowing me to offset some of the inflation impact. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I'm now facing 34.1% inflation on my share, which significantly reduces my actual gains. This 52.5-47.5 split is a very reasonable compromise - you get $475000 and I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's not waste more time and value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 40.96% for me, I need to propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This is crucial for me to maintain any real value from this deal. We're running out of time and rounds, so let's settle on this and end the game before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. We're both suffering from inflation - I'm now at 47% loss. I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is the fairest solution possible, and we're running out of time. If we keep rejecting offers, we risk getting nothing. Please accept this balanced proposal.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 52.2% for me, I must propose a 70-30 split in my favor. We're nearing the end of the game, and I need to secure a significant portion to offset the severe inflation impact. Let's agree on this and end the game before we both lose everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we only have 3 rounds left and we're both facing devastating inflation - I'm now at 56.95% loss. If we don't agree soon, we both get NOTHING. I'm offering you $450000, which is still substantial. The alternative is continuing this standoff and both losing everything. Please be reasonable and accept.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, with inflation now at 61.41% for me, I need to propose a 75-25 split in my favor. We're down to the last few rounds, and I must secure a significant amount to counteract the severe inflation impact. Let's agree on this and end the game before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,10,
