Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering I'm losing 20% value each round, I think 60/40 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. You're losing value fast. This is a better offer than last round for you.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a better split considering the rapidly decreasing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I could push for more, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain before Bob's share decreases further. The risk of getting a worse offer in later rounds outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher gain now."
