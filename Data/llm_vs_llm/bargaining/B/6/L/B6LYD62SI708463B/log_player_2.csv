"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The money will be worth the same for me (0% depreciation)
- The money will be worth 20% less for Alice

Since Alice faces significant depreciation in the next round, I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself. If I offer a similar total amount in the next round, it will be worth much less to her due to the 20% depreciation, giving me more leverage.

Therefore, I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 20% depreciation, I'll propose a split that gives me more than her initial offer, but still leaves her with a significant amount that she might accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Given the 20% depreciation you face in the next round, this offer gives you $400,000 now, which is better than a larger amount worth less later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering depreciation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me 450,000$, which is better than her initial offer of 400,000$
2. If I reject:
   - We go to next round
   - I face no depreciation
   - Alice faces even more depreciation (would go to 48% less)
   - I can make another offer

However, Alice has shown she's willing to reject aggressive offers, and we could end up in a situation where we both lose value through continued negotiation. The current offer gives me a reasonable amount, and pushing further might be counterproductive.

Given that Alice has moved significantly from her initial position and offered a fair compromise considering the depreciation factor, I will accept this offer.
