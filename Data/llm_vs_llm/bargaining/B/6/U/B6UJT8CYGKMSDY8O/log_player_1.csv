"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to keep more of the pie from the erosion of time, I'm offering you $444445. If you reject and wait for round 3, you'll likely secure roughly the same effective valueâ€”but with further loss from inflation. Let's settle now and avoid unnecessary devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 444445 
# Bob gain: 555555 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the value will decrease further in the next rounds, I'll accept Bob's offer to minimize the loss.
