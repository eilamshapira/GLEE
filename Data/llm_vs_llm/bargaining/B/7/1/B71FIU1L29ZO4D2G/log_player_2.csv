Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm willing to hold out for a fairer deal.  My goal is to secure at least 50% of the initial value, even if the nominal amount is less."

Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming more significant, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Alice consistently offers slightly more than the previous round, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome by continuing to reject offers that don't meet my minimum threshold."

This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option."
