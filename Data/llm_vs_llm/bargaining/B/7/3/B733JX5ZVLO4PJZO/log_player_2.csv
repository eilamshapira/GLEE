"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me
   - My maximum possible gain in the next round would be less than $80

While a 60/40 split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject it, I'll lose 20% value, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. The $40 I can get now is better than risking a lower effective amount later.
