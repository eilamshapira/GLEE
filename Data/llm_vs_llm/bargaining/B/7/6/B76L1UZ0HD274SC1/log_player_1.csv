"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It accounts for some inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

My gain: $450,000 * 0.95 (5% less) = $427,500

Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'll think about the next rounds and the decreasing value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since it's the third round, the money is worth:

For me: 5% less in Round 1, and another 5% less in Round 2, so 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 (or 9.75% less than the original value)
For Bob: 10% less in Round 1, and another 10% less in Round 2, so 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 (or 19% less than the original value)

My offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's aim for a 55/45 split in my favor this time""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, slightly better for me than your last offer to account for the faster inflation I experience. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

My gain: $480,000 * 0.8574 (14.26% less) = $411,712

Bob's offer seems to be taking into account the faster inflation he's experiencing, but I'll think about the next rounds and the decreasing value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since it's the fifth round, the money is worth:

For me: 0.8574 * 0.95 = 0.8145 (or 18.55% less than the original value)
For Bob: 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561 (or 34.39% less than the original value)

My offer:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to take on a bit more value, considering the inflation disparity""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the money is losing value fast. Let's be practical and split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

My gain: $500,000 * 0.7738 (22.62% less) = $386,900

Given the significant decrease in value and the fact that we're halfway through the rounds, a 50/50 split might be a reasonable compromise. Bob's message also emphasizes the urgency of the situation.
