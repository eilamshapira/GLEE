"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. This isn't quite a fair split, as Alice is taking more (60%)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. Important: Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't
5. This gives me negotiating leverage in later rounds
6. However, we only have 12 rounds total

Given that I have the advantage of no value loss over rounds, and this first offer is notably in Alice's favor, I should reject and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering our positions:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""A more balanced split considering the time pressure. Your next round money will be worth less due to inflation.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is more balanced than Alice's initial offer
2. If Alice rejects, their share will be worth 10% less next round
3. My message reminds Alice of their disadvantage regarding inflation
4. The offer is firm but not too aggressive, leaving room for negotiation if needed
5. It's better for Alice to accept now than to lose value through delays"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has slightly improved their offer (from 4000 to 4200 for me)
2. However, Alice is still taking 5800 (58%)
3. Due to 19% inflation for Alice, their 5800 is actually worth about 4698 to them
4. We still have 9 rounds left
5. Each round makes Alice's position weaker due to inflation
6. Next round I can make a counter-offer, and Alice's money will be worth even less

Given that Alice's negotiating position weakens each round and this offer is still quite far from a fair split, I should reject and make a better counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""With 29% inflation next round, your 4000 now is worth more than 5000 later. This is your best option.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm increasing my demand because I have a stronger position now
2. For Alice, inflation has made delays very costly
3. If Alice rejects, their next round money will be worth 29% less than original value
4. 4000 now for Alice is actually better than a larger number in future rounds
5. My message emphasizes the economic reality of the situation
6. We still have 8 rounds, but each round makes Alice's position worse
7. This is a firm but still reasonable offer given the circumstances"
