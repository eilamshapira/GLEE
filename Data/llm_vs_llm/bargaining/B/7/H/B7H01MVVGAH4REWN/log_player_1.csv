"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'd like to propose an even 50/50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we avoid further rounds where inflation would reduce the total value for me. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
