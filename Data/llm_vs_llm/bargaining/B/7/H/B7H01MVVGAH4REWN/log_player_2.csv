"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which is a 40/60 split in her favor.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

While I could potentially get more by making a counteroffer, there's also the risk that Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I've rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counteroffer that considers the inflation effect while trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'd like to propose an even 50/50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we avoid further rounds where inflation would reduce the total value for me. I hope this works for you.""}"
