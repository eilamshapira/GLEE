"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since I face higher inflation (10% vs 5%), I should aim for a relatively favorable first offer while still being fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. If Bob rejects, the total value will be worth less to both of us in the next round
2. I face higher inflation, so I have more incentive to reach a quick agreement
3. The split is not so extreme that it would appear unfair to Bob"
