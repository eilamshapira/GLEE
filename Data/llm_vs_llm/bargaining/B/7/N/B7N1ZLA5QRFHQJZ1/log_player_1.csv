"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with an offer that I think is fair given the inflation effect I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $4,000, Bob. I'm asking for a bit more because I face 20% inflation each round, which means if we go to another round, the money will be worth less to me. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
