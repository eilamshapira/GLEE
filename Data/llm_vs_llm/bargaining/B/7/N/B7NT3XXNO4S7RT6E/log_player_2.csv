Let's see if Alice can do better than a 50/50 split."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not generous enough to me, considering the inflation. Let's see if she can improve her offer in the next round.

I gain: 4650
Alice gains: 5350"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

Although Alice's offer is not very generous, it is still better than getting nothing. With inflation, I would gain 4468 and Alice would gain 3217. Let's accept the offer and end the game."
