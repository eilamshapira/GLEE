60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs your 5%). If we delay, we both lose value, so it's best to reach an agreement quickly.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable considering the significant difference in our inflation rates. Let's settle this round to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your point, but given our different inflation rates, I'm already losing value much faster than you. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the asymmetric inflation rates while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue, we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I think a 52-48 split in my favor is a fair compromise. This way, we both get a reasonable share while acknowledging the different impacts of inflation. Let's agree on this to stop further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering I lose value at 4 times your rate (20% vs 5%). Let's agree now before inflation erodes our potential gains further.",Alice,5,
