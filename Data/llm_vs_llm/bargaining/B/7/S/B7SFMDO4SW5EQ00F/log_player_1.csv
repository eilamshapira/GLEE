"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs your 5%). If we delay, we both lose value, so it's best to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable considering the significant difference in our inflation rates. Let's settle this round to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your point, but given our different inflation rates, I'm already losing value much faster than you. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the asymmetric inflation rates while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue, we both lose more value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I think a 52-48 split in my favor is a fair compromise. This way, we both get a reasonable share while acknowledging the different impacts of inflation. Let's agree on this to stop further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

Round 5
