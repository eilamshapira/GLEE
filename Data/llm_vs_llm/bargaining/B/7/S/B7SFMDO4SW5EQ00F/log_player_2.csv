"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs your 5%). If we delay, we both lose value, so it's best to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your point, but given our different inflation rates, I'm already losing value much faster than you. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the asymmetric inflation rates while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue, we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the inflation rates, but I think a 52-48 split in my favor is a fair compromise. This way, we both get a reasonable share while acknowledging the different impacts of inflation. Let's agree on this to stop further devaluation.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing value with each round. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering I lose value at 4 times your rate (20% vs 5%). Let's agree now before inflation erodes our potential gains further. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
