"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to act quickly against inflation. How about a slight advantage for me this time, considering the risk I took? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I'll calculate the actual value I'd receive. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $4000 offered would be equivalent to $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

Given this, I don't think the offer is favorable to me, especially since Bob's gain is reduced by 20% due to inflation, which might make him more desperate to make a deal in the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2). So, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before inflation reduces our gains further. This offer gives you a significant share, but I need a bit more to account for the decreasing value.""}"
