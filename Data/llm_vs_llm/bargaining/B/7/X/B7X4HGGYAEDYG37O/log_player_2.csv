"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

- Alice offers me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
- If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round
- However, the money value decreases: 10% for me, 20% for Alice each round
- In the next round, $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me and only $8,000 to Alice

This offer isn't terrible, but I can likely negotiate better terms since the devaluation affects Alice more severely than me. If I make a counteroffer, Alice has stronger incentives to accept due to the 20% devaluation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that accounts for the inflation effects and creates a win-win scenario.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

Given Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round compared to my 10%, I'm offering her a reasonable amount now rather than letting inflation erode her value significantly. This split is fair considering the asymmetric devaluation rates, and if Alice thinks rationally, she should accept this offer rather than losing more value in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer:

- Alice now offers me $4,200 (slightly improved from her initial $4,000 offer)
- Due to inflation, money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1
- So the $4,200 is effectively worth about $3,402 in round 1 terms
- If I reject and we go another round, my 10% inflation compounds further
- Alice is already experiencing 36% devaluation

While Alice has slightly improved her offer, the value continues to decrease for both of us. I should consider that we both lose if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our current situation and the ongoing inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This offer is more favorable to Alice than my previous one, recognizing that we both lose value with each passing round. Given that Alice faces higher depreciation (20% per round vs my 10%), accepting this offer now would be in both our interests. The split is close to fair and avoids further value erosion, which disproportionately affects Alice. I hope she recognizes that continuing this negotiation results in a lose-lose scenario due to compound inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation:

- Alice now offers me $4,400, which is her best offer so far
- Due to inflation, money is now worth 34.39% less to me than in round 1
- So $4,400 is effectively worth about $2,887 in round 1 terms
- Alice is experiencing 59.04% devaluation, meaning her $5,600 is worth only about $2,294 in round 1 terms
- We're now in round 5 of 12, with significant value already lost
- Further delays will compound our losses dramatically

At this point, continuing the negotiation is significantly reducing the total value available to both of us. Given the accelerating losses and the improved offer:
