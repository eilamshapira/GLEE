"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), it's in both our interests to reach a deal quickly. I'm proposing a slight adjustment that's still fair while accounting for our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the total amount is now effectively worth 80% of the original for me, and Bob's offer gives me 45, it's equivalent to 45 * 0.8 = 36 in the original value.

I think I can do better than that, so I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, the effective value of the money for me is now 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so in the third round, it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much of our share!""}"
