"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease due to inflation (10% less valuable for me, 20% less valuable for Alice).

Since this is just the first round, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer. The money will be worth less next round, but I might be able to get more than 50% of it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since inflation affects Alice more strongly than me, I can use this to propose a slightly better deal for myself while still making it attractive for Alice to accept rather than prolong negotiations.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), it's in both our interests to reach a deal quickly. I'm proposing a slight adjustment that's still fair while accounting for our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much of our share! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's counter-offer carefully. The money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1, and Alice's share is worth 36% less to her. This increasing inflation pressure works in my favor since it affects Alice more severely.

Alice is now offering me 52% of the pot, which is better than her initial 50/50 split, but less than my proposed 55/45 split. If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will further reduce the value, but I might get a higher percentage.

Given that we're already in round 3 and the inflation is significant, and Alice has moved toward my position, I think accepting this offer is reasonable.
