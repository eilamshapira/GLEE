,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. We'd both get $5000. Remember that with inflation, delaying costs us both money - the longer we negotiate, the less the total amount is worth to me, and possibly to you too. This equal split is fair and efficient.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try again. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split: 55/45. We're losing value with each round, so let's get this done!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I notice you're facing significantly higher inflation than I am. By round 3, your value decreased by 36% while mine only by 9.75%. This means waiting hurts you much more than me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we should agree now before your share loses even more value in future rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright, Bob, let's try a 50/50 split this time. It seems we're stuck, and delaying further is just going to hurt us both. Let's end the negotiation here.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your 50/50 offer, but let's look at the situation objectively. Your money is losing value at a dramatic rate - already 59% less valuable compared to round 1, while mine is only 18.55% less valuable. If we continue, your position will only worsen. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, which actually gives you more real value now than you'd get from a 50/50 split after several more rounds of your steep inflation. This is your best option to maximize what you'll actually receive.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm proposing a 40/60 split in your favor. The longer we wait, the worse it gets for me. I think this is a good compromise to secure some money for me, and I hope you accept it.",Alice,7,
