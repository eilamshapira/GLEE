Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. We'd both get $5000. Remember that with inflation, delaying costs us both money - the longer we negotiate, the less the total amount is worth to me, and possibly to you too. This equal split is fair and efficient.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you're facing significantly higher inflation than I am. By round 3, your value decreased by 36% while mine only by 9.75%. This means waiting hurts you much more than me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we should agree now before your share loses even more value in future rounds.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your 50/50 offer, but let's look at the situation objectively. Your money is losing value at a dramatic rate - already 59% less valuable compared to round 1, while mine is only 18.55% less valuable. If we continue, your position will only worsen. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, which actually gives you more real value now than you'd get from a 50/50 split after several more rounds of your steep inflation. This is your best option to maximize what you'll actually receive.

# Bob gain: 6500
