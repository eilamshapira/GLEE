"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the decreasing value of the money for both me and Bob with each round. Since it's the first round, the value is still at its highest. I will start with a relatively generous offer to try and secure a deal early.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning: I offer slightly more than half to me, which seems reasonable considering I'm the one making the proposal in the first round. I am prioritizing reaching an agreement and avoiding further rounds where the money loses value."
