"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer in this game with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair starting offer that gives both of us a good portion of the money. The split slightly favors me but still gives Bob a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that inflation is reducing the value of money more quickly for me than for Bob. With each round, I lose 20% of value while Bob only loses 5%.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both equal shares, and it's important we reach an agreement soon since inflation is affecting me more heavily than Bob."
