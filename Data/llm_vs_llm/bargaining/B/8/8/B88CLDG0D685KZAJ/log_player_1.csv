Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, Alice. However, I believe a more equitable split is 550000 for me and 450000 for you. This reflects the fact that I'm now the one making the proposal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
