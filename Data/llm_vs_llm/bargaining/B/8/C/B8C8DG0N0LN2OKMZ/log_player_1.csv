"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation effect on my earnings while being fair enough that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I know I'll face 20% inflation if we go to another round, this offer is actually reasonable for both of us. If you reject and we go to the next round, the total value to me drops to $800,000, so I'd need to get a much higher percentage just to break even.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a higher share. Since you face a higher inflation rate, I believe this offer is reasonable for both of us. If you reject, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, and I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
