"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I know I'll face 20% inflation if we go to another round, this offer is actually reasonable for both of us. If you reject and we go to the next round, the total value to me drops to $800000, so I'd need to get a much higher percentage just to break even. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a higher share. Since you face a higher inflation rate, I believe this offer is reasonable for both of us. If you reject, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, and I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.""}"
