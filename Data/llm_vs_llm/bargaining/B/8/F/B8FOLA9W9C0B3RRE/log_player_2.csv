"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of 40% for me and 60% for her. 

If I reject this offer, we'll move to Round 2 where I can make a counter-proposal, but the total money will be worth 5% less (so only $95 total to divide). While I could potentially get more in the next round, there's also a risk of losing more value if negotiations continue.

Given that $40 now is better than potentially less later (due to the 5% inflation penalty), and to avoid the risk of further devaluation, I'll accept this offer.
