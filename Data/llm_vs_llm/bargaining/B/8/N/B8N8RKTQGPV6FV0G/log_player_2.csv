"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I also get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - $100 Ã— 0.8 = $80 effective value
   - I could propose a higher split, but Alice might reject
3. This first offer isn't great for me, but:
   - It's a guaranteed $40
   - Future rounds mean decreasing value
   - Alice might be more aggressive in later rounds

Given the inflation risk and uncertainty of multiple rounds, I should probably negotiate for a better deal now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation risk we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since we both face risks from delays, I propose a more balanced split that gives both of us a good outcome. This way we can conclude quickly and avoid inflation losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation risk, let's find a middle ground. This offer is more balanced and ensures we both get a fair share while minimizing the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $45, but with 36% inflation means effectively $28.80 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - Money will be worth 48% less to me
   - Further delays make my position worse
   - $45 now is better than a higher nominal amount later
3. Alice has moved from her initial 60/40 split to a more reasonable 55/45
4. The inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains

While I might want more, the inflation penalty is becoming severe. Getting $28.80 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
