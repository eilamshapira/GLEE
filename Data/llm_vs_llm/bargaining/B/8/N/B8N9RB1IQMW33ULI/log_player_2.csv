"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $30 out of the $100, while she takes $70. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to account for the 20% inflation for my share. That means in the next round, the money would be worth 20% less to me.

Let me analyze: If I reject now and propose a better split in round 2, I'd face 20% inflation. So even if I managed to get more dollars in absolute terms, I need to calculate whether it would actually be worth more to me after accounting for inflation.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice), this complicates the strategy.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs Alice's 10%), I should propose a division that's attractive enough for Alice to accept, but still gives me a reasonable share.

If Alice rejects my offer, she'll make a counter-offer in round 3, but her money will be worth 10% less then. I need to leverage this to make an offer she's likely to accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fairer than her initial offer and gives her a reasonable amount that's worth more to her now than waiting for the next round with 10% inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this carefully considering the inflation effects.

In round 1, Alice offered me $30. I rejected it.
Now in round 3, Alice is offering me $40, but with 36% inflation for me.
$40 with 36% inflation means my effective value is $40 × (1-0.36) = $40 × 0.64 = $25.6

This is actually worse than her original offer of $30 in round 1. If I reject again, we'll go to round 4, where I'll face even more inflation (over 49% from the original value), making my position even weaker.

Given that my effective value is decreasing with each round and Alice has improved her nominal offer, it's rational to accept now.
