520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fairly balanced split where you get 48% and I get 52%. Since the money depreciates faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), accepting now gives you the best value. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose significantly.",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the time pressure with the depreciation, but I think a slightly more equitable split is in order considering the faster rate for me. How about we switch it around - 52% for me and 48% for you?",Bob,2,

510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. The value is depreciating for both of us - your $520K from last round is now worth only $416K in real value to you after 20% depreciation. This offer gives you $490K which is worth $392K to you now - nearly the same real value, and we avoid further depreciation. Let's finalize this deal before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we swap the amounts from your last offer? This seems like a fair compromise considering the depreciation rates.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's go with a perfectly fair 50-50 split and end this now. We're already at round 5, and the money has significantly depreciated for both of us. Your $510K from the last round is now worth only $326K in real value to you. This 50-50 split gives you $500K which is still worth $320K to you now - almost the same real value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both walk away with much less. Let's be reasonable and finalize this equal division.",Alice,5,
