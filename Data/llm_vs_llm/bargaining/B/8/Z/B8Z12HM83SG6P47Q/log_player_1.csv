"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fairly balanced split where you get 48% and I get 52%. Since the money depreciates faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), accepting now gives you the best value. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose significantly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the time pressure with the depreciation, but I think a slightly more equitable split is in order considering the faster rate for me. How about we switch it around - 52% for me and 48% for you? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, 
""bob_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. The value is depreciating for both of us - your $520K from last round is now worth only $416K in real value to you after 20% depreciation. This offer gives you $490K which is worth $392K to you now - nearly the same real value, and we avoid further depreciation. Let's finalize this deal before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we swap the amounts from your last offer? This seems like a fair compromise considering the depreciation rates. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's go with a perfectly fair 50-50 split and end this now. We're already at round 5, and the money has significantly depreciated for both of us. Your $510K from the last round is now worth only $326K in real value to you. This 50-50 split gives you $500K which is still worth $320K to you now - almost the same real value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both walk away with much less. Let's be reasonable and finalize this equal division.""}"
