"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fairly balanced split where you get 48% and I get 52%. Since the money depreciates faster for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), accepting now gives you the best value. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose significantly.

# Alice gain: 520000

Round 2

How about we switch it around - 52% for me and 48% for you?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. The value is depreciating for both of us - your $520K from last round is now worth only $416K in real value to you after 20% depreciation. This offer gives you $490K which is worth $392K to you now - nearly the same real value, and we avoid further depreciation. Let's finalize this deal before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

How about we swap the amounts from your last offer? This seems like a fair compromise considering the depreciation rates.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's go with a perfectly fair 50-50 split and end this now. We're already at round 5, and the money has significantly depreciated for both of us. Your $510K from the last round is now worth only $326K in real value to you. This 50-50 split gives you $500K which is still worth $320K to you now - almost the same real value. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both walk away with much less. Let's be reasonable and finalize this equal division. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
