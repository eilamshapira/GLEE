"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation affecting me across rounds while ensuring a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round while you aren't affected by inflation at all. This gives us both a good portion while accounting for my disadvantage if we were to continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Since we're now in round 3, I face 40% inflation on my gains compared to round 1. This offer gives you a better deal than my first proposal while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. Let's come to an agreement rather than letting inflation continue to reduce the value for me."
