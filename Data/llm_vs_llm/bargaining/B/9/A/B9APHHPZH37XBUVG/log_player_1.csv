"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3571, ""bob_gain"": 6429, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $3,571 and you receive $6,429. I’ve worked out a division that reflects our differing sensitivities to delay – while a delay will cost me 20% per round, it only costs you 10%, so waiting gives you a slight edge. This offer gives you what you’d expect to secure if you waited for your turn, making it fair and efficient for both of us. Let’s agree now and avoid any unnecessary loss in value!""}"
