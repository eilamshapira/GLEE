"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $45 while she takes $55. While this isn't an even split, it's close to fair. Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% less value per round), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I should consider that Alice might have stronger inflation pressures, which could explain why she's seeking a slightly larger share now.

I'll reject this offer to see if I can negotiate a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging we both want to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split, which seems the most fair division of the $100."
