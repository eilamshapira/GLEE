"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor, which isn't quite fair. Given that:

1. I have the advantage that money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
2. Alice loses 10% value each round
3. We have plenty of rounds left
4. A 50-50 split would be more fair

I should reject this offer and propose a more balanced split in the next round. Even if Alice rejects my next proposal, the decreasing value on her side gives me leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but I'll be diplomatic about it.

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both walk away equally satisfied.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but remember the money is losing value for me each round. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved from 60-40 to 55-45, showing willingness to negotiate
2. She's right about the inflation affecting her - her 55 is now worth about 44.55 (due to 19% decrease)
3. My 45 maintains its full value
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but continuing to negotiate might push Alice's value down further
5. This offer is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation factor

Since Alice has moved significantly toward a more balanced split, and considering the inflation impact on her side, this is a fair offer. If I reject, her next share will be worth even less, which might make future negotiations more difficult.
