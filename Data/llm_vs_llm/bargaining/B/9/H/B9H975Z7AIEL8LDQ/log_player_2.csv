"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. 

Current offer value: $400,000
Next round maximum value: $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000

While I could potentially get more in the next round, there's risk in rejection:
1. Alice might reject my counter-offer
2. The 20% inflation penalty is significant
3. We only have 12 rounds to reach agreement

Given these factors, while the split isn't exactly 50-50, $400,000 is a substantial amount and accepting now avoids inflation risk.
