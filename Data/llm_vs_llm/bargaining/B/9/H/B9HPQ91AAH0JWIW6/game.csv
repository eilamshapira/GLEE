510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a near-equal split. I'm proposing $510K for me and $490K for you. If you reject, we'll lose $100K to inflation, and you'll have to make the next offer. This way we both get almost half a million dollars right away.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think it's more fair if we adjust the split slightly in my favor this time, considering I'm taking on the risk in this round. How about we try $550K for me and $450K for you?",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I think we need to be more balanced. The money is now worth even less due to inflation, so we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you $480K and I'll take $520K. This is very close to a 50-50 split, and if we continue negotiating, we'll both lose more value to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,3,
