"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division of the money with a slight advantage for me, and explain my reasoning to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a near-equal split. I'm proposing $510K for me and $490K for you. If you reject, we'll lose $100K to inflation, and you'll have to make the next offer. This way we both get almost half a million dollars right away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think it's more fair if we adjust the split slightly in my favor this time, considering I'm taking on the risk in this round. How about we try $550K for me and $450K for you? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I think we need to be more balanced. The money is now worth even less due to inflation, so we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you $480K and I'll take $520K. This is very close to a 50-50 split, and if we continue negotiating, we'll both lose more value to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""
