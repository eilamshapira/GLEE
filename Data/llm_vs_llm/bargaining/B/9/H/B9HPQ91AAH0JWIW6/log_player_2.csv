"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a near-equal split. I'm proposing $510K for me and $490K for you. If you reject, we'll lose $100K to inflation, and you'll have to make the next offer. This way we both get almost half a million dollars right away.

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I think it's more fair if we adjust the split slightly in my favor this time, considering I'm taking on the risk in this round. How about we try $550K for me and $450K for you?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but I think we need to be more balanced. The money is now worth even less due to inflation, so we should reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering you $480K and I'll take $520K. This is very close to a 50-50 split, and if we continue negotiating, we'll both lose more value to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most rational decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now avoids further losses.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out for a better offer in Round 4, the gains would be minimal compared to the risk of Alice offering even less. 
* **Reasonable Split:** While not a perfect 50/50 split, it's close enough and guarantees a significant sum. 

Waiting any longer puts my gains at greater risk for relatively small potential reward."
