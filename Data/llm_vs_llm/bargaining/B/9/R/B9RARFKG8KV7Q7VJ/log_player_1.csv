"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Round 1

I need to consider that with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation, but not to Bob. This gives him an advantage in later rounds. I should make a fair offer that he's likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which gives each of us $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests and should be acceptable to Bob."
