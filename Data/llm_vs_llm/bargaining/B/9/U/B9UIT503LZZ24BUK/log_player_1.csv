"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer. I want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept and avoid value loss from inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. Even with the 20% inflation penalty for the next round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer gives them too large an advantage, and I'll make a more balanced counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3 and any gains will be worth 40% less than in round 1, I'll make a more balanced offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm proposing a more equitable split to increase the chances of acceptance, as further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us. This offer gives Bob a very fair portion while still maintaining a small advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal for me, considering we're already in round 4 and the money has lost 48.8% of its value, further negotiations would lead to even greater losses for both of us. My $420,000 now is worth about $215,040 in round 1 value, and if we continue negotiating, the losses from inflation will outweigh potential gains from a better split."
