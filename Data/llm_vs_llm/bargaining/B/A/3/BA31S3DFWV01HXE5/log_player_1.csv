"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm going to make a fair offer that considers the inflation effect on my side, while being reasonable to Bob.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $40 while I take $60. I want to be transparent that I face 20% inflation each round, so waiting costs me significantly. This is a fair split considering my constraints, and we can both walk away with money right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the inflation you face. I propose we split the $100 with me receiving $45 and you receiving $55. This gives us both a fair amount while considering the inflation risk moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
