"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $40 while I take $60. I want to be transparent that I face 20% inflation each round, so waiting costs me significantly. This is a fair split considering my constraints, and we can both walk away with money right now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
