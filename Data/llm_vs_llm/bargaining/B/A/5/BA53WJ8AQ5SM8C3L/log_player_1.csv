"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer. Since I'm starting and there's a 5% inflation penalty per round for me, I want to secure a good deal early while also being fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonably fair to Bob. I'm offering him a significant portion to encourage acceptance, as waiting would cost me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer would give me $487,180
2. Due to 5% inflation, this is actually worth $487,180 * 0.95 = $462,821 to me
3. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but that will be subject to 10% total inflation for me
4. Bob's offer is fairly balanced, but the inflation effect makes it less attractive for me

Given that each round makes things worse for me due to inflation, and this is still a reasonable offer (even with inflation I get over 460k), I should probably accept rather than risk further devaluation.
