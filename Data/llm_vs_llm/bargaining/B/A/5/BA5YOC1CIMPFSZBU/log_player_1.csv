"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles.  I'll take 60 and you get 40.  It's fair and we'll both get a good chunk before any inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 40$ I would receive is worth 36$ to me due to 10% inflation, while Bob's 60$ maintains full value. I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for this inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Due to the 10% inflation effect on my side, I need a larger share to make up for the decreased value. This split would give me effectively 58.5$ in round 1 value, which is quite fair. Let's conclude the deal now before further inflation.""}"
