"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% inflation effect on my side, I need a larger share to make up for the decreased value. This split would give me effectively 58.5$ in round 1 value, which is quite fair. Let's conclude the deal now before further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
