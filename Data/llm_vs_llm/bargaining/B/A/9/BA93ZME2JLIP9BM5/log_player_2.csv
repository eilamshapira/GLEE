"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is the first round and Alice has offered me $4000 out of $10,000, I need to evaluate whether this is a good deal considering the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and propose next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. I could potentially negotiate for more, but there's risk in continued negotiation as the value decreases with each round.

Let me consider: $4000 now is better than potentially getting a higher percentage of a diminishing pot. If I wait until the next round, I'd need to get at least $4211 (â‰ˆ $4000/0.95) to break even on today's value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for inflation while being fair enough for Alice to potentially accept.
