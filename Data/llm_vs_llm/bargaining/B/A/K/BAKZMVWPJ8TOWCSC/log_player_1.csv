"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with an offer. Let me explain briefly my reasoning (though you don’t need all the details):

We’re dividing $100, but note that with every round that passes Bob’s money is “inflated” by an effective 5% penalty – that is, if you wait an extra round, Bob’s dollars are worth only 95% of their face‐value, whereas mine never lose value. By backward–induction (looking ahead to what would happen if we rejected offers until the final round) one can show that in a subgame–perfect equilibrium my optimal proposal in round 1 is to offer you a share of about $73.51 and to keep about $26.49 for myself. (If you reject, you’d become the proposer in round 2—but then the eventual equilibrium would leave you with an effective value lower than $73.51 because of the 5% loss per round.)

Thus, here is my offer in JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 26.49, ""bob_gain"": 73.51}"
