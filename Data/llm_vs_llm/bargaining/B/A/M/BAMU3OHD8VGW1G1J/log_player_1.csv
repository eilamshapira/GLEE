"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a quick agreement to maximize our outcomes given the inflation on my side. Let's split the $1,000,000 so that I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000 right away. Accepting now saves time and avoids further losses due to inflation for me, and I hope this offer is attractive enough for you as well. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Considering the inflation pressures and our limited rounds, I propose a quick agreement that benefits both of us promptly. I suggest a division where I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This deal helps preserve more of your value than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds. Let's finalize this division now to avoid any further loss. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your clear proposal and for considering the inflation impact on my side. I agree that finalizing now is the best way to avoid further loss. Let's proceed with the $450,000 for me and $550,000 for you.""}"
