Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a quick agreement to maximize our outcomes given the inflation on my side. Let's split the $1000000 so that I receive $600000 and you receive $400000 right away. Accepting now saves time and avoids further losses due to inflation for me, and I hope this offer is attractive enough for you as well. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
