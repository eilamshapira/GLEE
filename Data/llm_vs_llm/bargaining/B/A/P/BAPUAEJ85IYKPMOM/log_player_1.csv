"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce our total gains. Let's be equal partners in this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
