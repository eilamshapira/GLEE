"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this quickly and get this done. I propose 90/10 split, and we both walk away with a good sum. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is quite unbalanced, offering me only 10% of the total amount while she takes 90%. Given that we are only in the first round and there are still 11 rounds left, I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round. Considering the 5% inflation per round, it's worth making a counter-proposal to seek a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a much more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce our total gains. Let's be equal partners in this.""}"
