"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Alice's offer of a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance. However, I'm playing as Bob and I know that with each round, my share loses 5% value due to inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my potential gains would already be worth less.

Since this is the very first round:
1. The money still has its full value
2. 5000$ is a reasonable share
3. Waiting would only decrease the value of my share
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

Given these factors, it's rational to accept this fair offer now rather than risk losing value through inflation.
