168766.0,831234.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the further erosion of value in later rounds and following a backward‚Äêinduction analysis of our alternating offers (with my funds losing 20% per round and yours 5%), I propose that I receive $168766 and you receive $831234. This split reflects the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue toward round 12. I hope you agree that it is in both our interests to settle now.",Alice,1,
