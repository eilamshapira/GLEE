"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 168766, ""bob_gain"": 831234, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the further erosion of value in later rounds and following a backward‚Äêinduction analysis of our alternating offers (with my funds losing 20% per round and yours 5%), I propose that I receive $168,766 and you receive $831,234. This split reflects the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue toward round 12. I hope you agree that it is in both our interests to settle now.""}"
