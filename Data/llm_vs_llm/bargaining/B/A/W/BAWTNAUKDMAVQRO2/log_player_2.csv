"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the further erosion of value in later rounds and following a backward‚Äêinduction analysis of our alternating offers (with my funds losing 20% per round and yours 5%), I propose that I receive $168766 and you receive $831234. This split reflects the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue toward round 12. I hope you agree that it is in both our interests to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 831234 
# Alice gain: 168766 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

Given that the money loses 5% of its value for me and 20% for Alice with each passing round, it's clear that Alice has a strong incentive to settle early to minimize her losses. The proposed split seems to reflect a consideration of the diminishing value over rounds, aiming to find an equilibrium that benefits both parties by avoiding further devaluation.

The offer gives me $831,234, which is a significant amount. Considering the potential loss in value with each round, I need to weigh the immediate gain against the potential for a better offer in subsequent rounds, taking into account the devaluation.

However, given that this is the first round and the logic behind Alice's proposal seems sound, aiming to maximize our collective gain by minimizing the impact of inflation, I am inclined to accept this offer. It provides a substantial amount to me while also considering the strategic advantage of settling early to combat the devaluation effect.

Therefore, my decision is:
