"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering potential future rounds and inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose taking $60 while giving Bob $40. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a good portion while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I get $45 now, it's effectively worth $40.5 to me
2. If I reject and make another offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
3. Bob's behavior suggests they're looking for a majority share
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds due to increasing inflation

Given these factors, even though this split favors Bob, the inflation penalty makes accepting now better than risking further rounds.
