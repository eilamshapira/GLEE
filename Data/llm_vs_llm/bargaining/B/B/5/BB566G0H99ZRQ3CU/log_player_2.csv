"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you found 60-40 unfair and proposed 55-45, how about we meet in the middle at 55-45 in my favor this time? Let's settle it here. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough spot. Accepting means a lower payout than my previous offer, but rejecting means risking an even lower payout next round due to inflation. However, Alice is consistently pushing for a higher share, suggesting she might be more susceptible to the time pressure. My hope is that rejecting this offer will push her towards a more equitable split in the next round."
