"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair outcome. We both face inflation, and while mine is higher, this even split benefits us both and avoids further rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 to me.

Considering this, I think a 50-50 split is reasonable, especially since Bob's gain is worth 20% less to him, which is a bigger penalty.
