"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This isn't an even split, and if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, but only 5% less to her.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the $10,000 would be worth $8,000 to me and $9,500 to Alice. This gives me some leverage to negotiate for a better split, potentially closer to 50-50.

Given the significant inflation difference between us and the current uneven split offered, I'll reject this offer to propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates but aims for a more balanced outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair outcome. We both face inflation, and while mine is higher, this even split benefits us both and avoids further rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value.""}"
