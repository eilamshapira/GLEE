"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us. Keep in mind that inflation impacts me more significantly (20% per round) than it does you (5% per round), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $5000
2. If I reject, and we go to next round:
   - Due to 5% inflation, each dollar will be worth less to me
   - I could propose a better split, but Alice faces 20% inflation
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further losses for both

While I could try to negotiate for more, the relatively low inflation rate for me (5%) compared to Alice's (20%) means she has more incentive to agree now. This even split is actually quite reasonable given these conditions, and trying to get more might lead to worse outcomes for both of us.
