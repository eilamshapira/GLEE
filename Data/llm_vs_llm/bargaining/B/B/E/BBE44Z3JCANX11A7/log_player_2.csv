"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of $50 each. This is fair for both of us and we can both walk away satisfied with an even split.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a sizable portion to settle this quickly. Time is money, after all.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your offer because it wasn't balanced. I'm offering you $45, which actually has more value for you now than waiting another round due to your 10% inflation penalty. Let's conclude this fairly and efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
