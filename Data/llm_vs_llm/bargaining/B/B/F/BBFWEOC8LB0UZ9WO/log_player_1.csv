"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation penalty for both players. Since Bob's inflation penalty (10%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. With higher inflation penalty for Bob, waiting will cost him more
3. It's a reasonable first offer that shows willingness to share while maintaining a slight advantage as the first mover"
