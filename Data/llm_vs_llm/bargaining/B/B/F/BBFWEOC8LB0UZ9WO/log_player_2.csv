"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer. Alice is proposing that I (Bob) receive $400,000 and she receives $600,000 out of the $1,000,000.

I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 10% less, while Alice's will be worth 5% less. This means waiting is costlier for me than for Alice.

If I reject, the next round I could propose something better, but the total value would already be reduced. $400,000 now is worth more than a potentially higher nominal amount in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate I face.

Given these considerations, this is a reasonable first offer. I'll accept it.
