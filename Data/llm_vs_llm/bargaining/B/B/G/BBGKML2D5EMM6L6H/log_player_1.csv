"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally at 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share right now, without further decreases in value for us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth less now, but I can still make a better offer in the next round. Given the asymmetric inflation rates (Bob's money loses value much faster than mine), I'll make another proposal that accounts for this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I'm reducing my share to 55-45 in your favor compared to my first offer. Consider that your money is losing value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). If you reject this, by next round your share will be worth even less due to the high inflation rate affecting you.""}"
