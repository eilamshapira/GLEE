Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm reducing my share to 55-45 in your favor compared to my first offer. Consider that your money is losing value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). If you reject this, by next round your share will be worth even less due to the high inflation rate affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
