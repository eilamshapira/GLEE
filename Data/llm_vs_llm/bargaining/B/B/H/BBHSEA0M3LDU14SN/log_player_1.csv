"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Since there's inflation affecting Bob's value (5% less each round) but not mine, I should consider making a fair initial offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division where we both receive equal amounts. I believe fairness in the first round will encourage cooperation."
