"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation factor that affects only my share.

If I reject and move to the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me. If I make a proposal in the next round that Alice accepts, the best I could hope for is to get most of that $90 value.

On the other hand, accepting Alice's offer now gives me $50 without any inflation penalty.

Given that rejecting would put me at a disadvantage due to the asymmetric inflation penalty, accepting this equal split is actually the rational choice.
