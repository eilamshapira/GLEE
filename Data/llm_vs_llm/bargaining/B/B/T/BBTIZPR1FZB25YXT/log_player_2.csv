"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Given that:
1. Alice's money loses 10% value each round
2. My money maintains its value
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round

If I reject, in the next round Alice's 500,000 would only be worth 450,000 to her. This gives me negotiating leverage to ask for more in the next round, as she would want to avoid further devaluation of her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I can leverage this to get a better deal. If Alice rejects my offer, her share would be worth another 10% less in the next round. Therefore, she should be motivated to accept a reasonable offer that favors me slightly.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is better than what she'll likely get if she rejects and we continue to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me 550,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Her 450,000 is actually worth only 364,500 to her (due to 19% depreciation)
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will depreciate further (by 29% from original value)
4. However, this offer is better than the first one and shows movement in my direction

Given that:
- I'm getting a good increase from the initial 50-50 split
- Further negotiation might risk Alice becoming less cooperative
- The offer is reasonable given the depreciation pressure on Alice
- I'm getting more than half of the actual value in the deal
