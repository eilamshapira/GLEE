This division – I receive $555,556 and you receive $444,444 – reflects an equitable split adjusted for our time preferences. I believe it’s a fair and efficient solution for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split is more fair. This accounts for the time value of money, as each round that passes reduces the value of our potential earnings.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 380000, ""bob_gain"": 620000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid additional losses from the inflation—my share now is only worth 60% of its nominal value—I propose we settle this round. I'm offering 380,000 for myself and 620,000 for you. I realize your money might be less affected by waiting, so this 38/62 split reflects the extra cost of delay on my side while giving you a slightly better deal. Let's conclude this now rather than risk further devaluation. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
