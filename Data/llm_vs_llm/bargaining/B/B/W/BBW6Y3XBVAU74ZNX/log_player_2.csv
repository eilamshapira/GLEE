"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid costly delays (as each extra round reduces my share’s value by 20%), I propose we settle now. This division – I receive $555556 and you receive $444444 – reflects an equitable split adjusted for our time preferences. I believe it’s a fair and efficient solution for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split is more fair. This accounts for the time value of money, as each round that passes reduces the value of our potential earnings.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid additional losses from the inflation—my share now is only worth 60% of its nominal value—I propose we settle this round. I'm offering 380000 for myself and 620000 for you. I realize your money might be less affected by waiting, so this 38/62 split reflects the extra cost of delay on my side while giving you a slightly better deal. Let's conclude this now rather than risk further devaluation. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 620000 
# Alice gain: 380000
