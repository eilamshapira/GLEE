"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1, formatted as JSON:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money I'd gain, considering the inflation.

In Round 1, I was offered $60. Due to 10% inflation, the $100 is now worth 10% less. That means the actual value of the money decreases.

My calculation:

*   My gain: 40
*   My gain in terms of the first round's worth: 40 / 0.9 = 44.44$

I will reject.

```json
