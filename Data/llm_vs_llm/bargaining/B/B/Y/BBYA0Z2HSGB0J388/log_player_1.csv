"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. It's a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where inflation will reduce the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $500,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $450,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. Bob's first rejection shows he's willing to negotiate, but his 50-50 offer seems fair
4. Further rounds will continue to decrease the value for me due to inflation
5. There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer in the next round

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. Getting $450,000 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation.
