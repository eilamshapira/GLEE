"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I receive $350,000 while she gets $650,000 of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll be able to make my own proposal. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $800,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $350,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'd need to get more than $437,500 in the next round to come out ahead ($350,000 รท 0.8 = $437,500).

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fact that $350,000 is still a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
