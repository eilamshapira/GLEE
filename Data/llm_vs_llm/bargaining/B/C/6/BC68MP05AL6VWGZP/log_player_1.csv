"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob for the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the million dollars with me receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us substantial gains, and considering the inflation effect on my end, it's important we reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is seeking a larger portion, but I need to consider the inflation effect that's affecting my gains. Let me make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the million dollars. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since inflation is reducing my value by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than continuing to negotiate and lose value."
