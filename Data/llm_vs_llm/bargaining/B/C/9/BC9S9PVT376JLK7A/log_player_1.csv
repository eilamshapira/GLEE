"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 20% inflation per round, my offer of 55-45 in my favor is more than fair. It's a better deal for you than last round, and we should settle before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. With 20% inflation, my $4500 now is worth $3600 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the 20% additional inflation will reduce the real value further
3. Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances, and continuing to negotiate would likely lead to worse outcomes for both of us
4. The difference between this offer and my initial proposal (after accounting for inflation) isn't large enough to justify the risk of another round of inflation"
