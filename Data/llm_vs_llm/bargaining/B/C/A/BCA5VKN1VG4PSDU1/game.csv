6100.0,3900.0,"Alice, I know you proposed a 60-40 split in your favor last round. To close quickly—and given that each round further erodes the value of my share due to inflation—I’m offering you a slightly better deal: you receive $6100 and I get $3900. I believe this small improvement for you makes accepting now a smart move for both sides. Let's avoid further losses and settle today.",Bob,2,
