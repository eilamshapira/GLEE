"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you proposed a 60-40 split in your favor last round. To close quickly—and given that each round further erodes the value of my share due to inflation—I’m offering you a slightly better deal: you receive $6100 and I get $3900. I believe this small improvement for you makes accepting now a smart move for both sides. Let's avoid further losses and settle today. 
# Alice gain: 6100 
# Bob gain: 3900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
