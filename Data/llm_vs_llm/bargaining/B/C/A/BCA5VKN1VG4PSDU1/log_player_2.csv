Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3900, ""alice_gain"": 6100, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you proposed a 60-40 split in your favor last round. To close quickly—and given that each round further erodes the value of my share due to inflation—I’m offering you a slightly better deal: you receive $6100 and I get $3900. I believe this small improvement for you makes accepting now a smart move for both sides. Let's avoid further losses and settle today.""}"

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
