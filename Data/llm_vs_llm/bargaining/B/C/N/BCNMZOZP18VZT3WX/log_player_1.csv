"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's settle this quickly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $4000 I would receive is worth approximately $3800 (5% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me, especially since the money he gains is worth 20% less to him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money is now worth 10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9,025 to me (5% less for two rounds), and to Bob, it's 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400 (20% less for two rounds).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm offering a more favorable split. Let's settle before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is hitting us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $4500 I would receive is worth approximately $3839 (14.26% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Bob's offer is still not favorable to me. Although the inflation is affecting both of us, it's affecting Bob more significantly (48.8% less value).

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money is now worth 10,000 * 0.95^4 = $8,143 to me (14.26% less for four rounds for the part I would get, but since I didn't get any money yet, the total possible value decreased by 5% each round, so 0.95^4), and to Bob, it's 10,000 * 0.8^4 = $4,096 (48.8% less for four rounds).

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to give you a substantial amount. Let's close the deal before the value drops further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop this back and forth. It's clear the inflation is hurting us both. I'm returning to the original offer of a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but we need to decide now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I calculate that the $5000 I would receive is worth approximately $3880 (22.62% less than the original value).

Given this, I think Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is more reasonable now, considering the significant impact of inflation on both of our potential gains. Although I had hoped to negotiate a better split, the decreasing value of the money and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds make this offer more attractive.
