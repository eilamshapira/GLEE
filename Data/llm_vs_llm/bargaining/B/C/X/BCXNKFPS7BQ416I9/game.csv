60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor since I'm facing 10% inflation each round. This gives us both a fair outcome now rather than letting the total value decrease.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's compromise at 55/45 in my favor. We've both lost value due to inflation - for me, this $55 is now worth only $49.5 due to the 10% depreciation. Further delays will reduce our total value even more. This is a fair middle ground.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering we've both lost value, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. 52/48 is my new proposal. The longer we wait, the more we both lose.",Bob,4,
