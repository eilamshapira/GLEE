"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a first offer to Bob, considering the inflation factor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor since I'm facing 10% inflation each round. This gives us both a fair outcome now rather than letting the total value decrease.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's compromise at 55/45 in my favor. We've both lost value due to inflation - for me, this $55 is now worth only $49.5 due to the 10% depreciation. Further delays will reduce our total value even more. This is a fair middle ground.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 52
