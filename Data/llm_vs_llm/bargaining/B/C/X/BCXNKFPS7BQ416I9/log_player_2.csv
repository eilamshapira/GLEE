"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split in my favor since I'm facing 10% inflation each round. This gives us both a fair outcome now rather than letting the total value decrease. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's compromise at 55/45 in my favor. We've both lost value due to inflation - for me, this $55 is now worth only $49.5 due to the 10% depreciation. Further delays will reduce our total value even more. This is a fair middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
