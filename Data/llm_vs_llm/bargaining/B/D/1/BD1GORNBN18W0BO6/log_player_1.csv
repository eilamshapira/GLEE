"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, while Bob doesn't. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage with the inflation mechanic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than I proposed initially, accepting now is better than continuing to later rounds where inflation would reduce my share's value even further. With the 5% inflation penalty, delaying would only decrease what I receive in real terms."
