"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now:
- Next round my share would need to be at least 6250$ (5000/0.8) to be equivalent to accepting 5000$ now
- Alice might not accept such a proposal, leading to further rounds and more value loss

A 50-50 split is fair, and the inflation risk makes it unwise to reject a reasonable first offer.
