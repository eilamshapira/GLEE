# Bob gain: 600000

I need to hold strong a little longer. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and will likely offer a larger amount next round."

""bob_gain"": 400000,

This feels like a good final offer. It's a significant gain for me, and the pressure of inflation makes it less likely Bob will risk rejecting it."
