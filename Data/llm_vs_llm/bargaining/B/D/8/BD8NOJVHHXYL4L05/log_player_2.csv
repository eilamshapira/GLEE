"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the advantage I have in the early rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's make it more even, considering the inflation factor""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Alice's offer is less than the face value. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me, the $350,000 would be equivalent to approximately $317,625 in the first round's value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (14.76% less than in the first round, due to two rounds of 5% inflation and then another round), I'll make an offer that's more favorable to myself to try to get a better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at my potential gain, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The inflation is only getting worse for you. It's in your best interest to accept. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Alice's offer is approximately $325,450 in the first round's value, since the money is worth 18.55% less for me.

Given that this is Alice's final offer and the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money for me, I should accept this offer to avoid further losses.
