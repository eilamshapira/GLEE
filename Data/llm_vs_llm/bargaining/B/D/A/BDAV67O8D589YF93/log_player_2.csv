"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I get 550k, you get 450k. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the decreasing value.

""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, considering the decreasing value for me. This is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'll take 600k, you take 400k. This is my best offer, and inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 9.75% decrease in value for me, the actual value of $400,000 is approximately $361,000. This is a significant decrease, and Alice's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (14.76% less than in the first round, due to two 5% reductions and considering the compounding effect: 1 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025), I'll make a more aggressive offer to myself to account for the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is really hurting me now. I need a better deal to make it worth my while.""}"
