"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 10% inflation risk if we move to further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which appears fair
2. I'm taking slightly more (55%) since I'm making the first offer
3. If Bob rejects, my next potential gain will be worth 10% less due to inflation
4. This offer gives Bob a substantial amount that should be appealing enough to accept"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 (worth 90% of original value = $405,000 in round 1 terms)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (worth 80% of original value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 80% of original value
   * I can make a new offer, but risking further depreciation

The offer is not ideal, but considering:
- The rapid depreciation of money value
- The risk of prolonging negotiations
- The fact that $405,000 in effective value is still substantial
- We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer to secure a good value before further depreciation."
