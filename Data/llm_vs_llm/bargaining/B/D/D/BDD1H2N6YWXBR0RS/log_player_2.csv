"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to remember that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me due to inflation, while Alice experiences no inflation penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So if I demanded more in the next round, I'd need to get at least 52.6% of the pot to do better than accepting 50% now.

Given the time pressure (12 rounds maximum) and the asymmetric inflation that only affects me, accepting a fair split now is reasonable.
