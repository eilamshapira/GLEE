"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 4000$ in the first round, I don't suffer any inflation loss yet. It's 40% of the total sum.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation. So even if I manage to get more money in the next round, I need to factor in this loss.

For example, if I got 5000$ in round 2, it would actually be worth 4000$ to me due to inflation, which is the same as what I'm being offered now.

While 4000$ isn't the most generous offer, considering the inflation risk and that we have a limited number of rounds, it's a reasonable starting offer.
