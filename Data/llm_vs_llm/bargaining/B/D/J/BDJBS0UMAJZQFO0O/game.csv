4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the time pressure affecting you more than me. If we go to the next round, your share would lose 20% value. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is equal to what $5000 would be worth to you next round. This is fair given our different time constraints.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe we can still find a more equitable solution. Let's try to reach a fair agreement in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
3200.0,6800.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my share, I'm proposing $3200 for me, which is equivalent to $5000 from the first round after two rounds of inflation. This leaves you with $6800, which is still a significant amount. Let's settle this round.",Alice,3,
