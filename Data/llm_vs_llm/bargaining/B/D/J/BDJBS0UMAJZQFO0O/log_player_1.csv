Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the time pressure affecting you more than me. If we go to the next round, your share would lose 20% value. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is equal to what $5000 would be worth to you next round. This is fair given our different time constraints. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
