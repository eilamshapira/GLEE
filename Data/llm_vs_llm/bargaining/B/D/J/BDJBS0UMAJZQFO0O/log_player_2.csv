"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm analyzing this offer:

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give each of us $5,000.

I need to consider the inflation factor:
- For me (Bob), money doesn't lose value between rounds (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money loses 20% value each round

If I reject and we go to the next round, Alice's $5,000 would only be worth $4,000 to her (80% of the original value). This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round when I make the offer.

Since there's no downside for me in waiting, and Alice has more urgency to finish the game due to her inflation penalty, I should negotiate for a better share.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the time pressure affecting you more than me. If we go to the next round, your share would lose 20% value. This offer gives you $4,000 now, which is equal to what $5,000 would be worth to you next round. This is fair given our different time constraints.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my share, I'm proposing $3200 for me, which is equivalent to $5000 from the first round after two rounds of inflation. This leaves you with $6800, which is still a significant amount. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm analyzing Alice's new offer:

Alice is offering me $6,800 while taking $3,200 for herself. She's correctly calculated that due to the 36% inflation on her side (after two rounds), $3,200 now is roughly equivalent to the $5,000 she originally proposed in round 1.

This is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, where I proposed $6,000 for myself. Alice has adjusted her expectations based on the inflation affecting her share.

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where I would make the next offer. However, Alice's inflation would increase further (to around 49% less value), which might lead her to accept an even lower amount. But there's also risk she might reject again, extending the game.

Since this offer already gives me 68% of the total amount, which is quite favorable, I'll accept.
