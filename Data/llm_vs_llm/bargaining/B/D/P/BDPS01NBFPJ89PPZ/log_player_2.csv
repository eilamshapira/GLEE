"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me 20% of the total amount ($200,000), keeping 80% ($800,000) for herself. While this is quite uneven, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation, meaning the total value to me will only be worth $800,000
2. I would get to make the next offer, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. Getting $200,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation

However, this offer is too low. Even with inflation risk, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're in round 2, I need to consider that the money is worth 20% less to me now ($800,000 in effective value). However, I still want to make a fair offer that Alice is likely to accept to avoid further inflation losses.

I'll propose a more balanced split, but one that still gives me a decent share since I'm affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me 60% and Alice 40%. My reasoning is:
1. It's a more equitable split than Alice's initial offer
2. Given the 20% inflation I'm experiencing, my $600,000 is effectively worth $480,000 to me
3. It's reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk further rounds
4. If Alice rejects, the next round will have even more severe inflation for me"
