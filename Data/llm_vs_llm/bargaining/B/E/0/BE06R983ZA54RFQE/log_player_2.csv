"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is:
- I get $4,500
- Alice gets $5,500

Given that:
- This is the first round, so no inflation impact yet
- I'm being offered 45% of the total
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer but will face 5% inflation
- After inflation in round 2, the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me

While the split isn't perfectly equal, $4,500 is a significant amount. If I reject, I'd need to get substantially more in the next round to offset the 5% inflation loss. Any prolonged negotiation will keep reducing the real value of the money for me.
