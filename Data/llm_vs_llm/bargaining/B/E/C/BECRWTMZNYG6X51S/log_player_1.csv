"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Rationale:**

*   **Starting Strong:** I'm aiming for a slightly favorable split to establish a baseline.
*   **Respectable Offer:** $4000 is a substantial amount for Bob and should be tempting enough to consider.
*   **Inflation Awareness:** I'm aware of the inflation, which could make Bob accept a less favorable offer now, rather than risking further devaluation in later rounds."
