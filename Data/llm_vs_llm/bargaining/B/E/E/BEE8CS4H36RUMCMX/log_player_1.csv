"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think about this strategically. In each round, the value of the money for me decreases by 10%, but not for Bob. So I need to make a compelling offer to avoid losing value.

Given this asymmetry in the game, I should make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value for me while being attractive enough for Bob to accept.

My offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion that's close to half, which should be fair enough for him to accept rather than moving to the next round where the total value would decrease for me. This balanced approach respects both of our interests in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the situation carefully. Bob rejected my initial offer where I would get $550,000, and I rejected his offer where I would get $400,000. Now in round 3, any money I receive is worth 20% less to me due to inflation (10% from round 1 and another 10% from round 2).

Let me make a more strategic offer that considers this diminishing value while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

A perfectly even split is the fairest possible division and should be compelling for Bob to accept. Given that I'm already facing a 20% penalty on my gains due to inflation, it would be in my best interest to reach an agreement now rather than risk further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic now. We're in round 5, and the money is worth 30% less to me due to compounding inflation (10% in each previous round). Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of this inflation pressure, offering me less each time while gaining more himself.

Given that any further delays will significantly reduce the value of my share, I need to make an offer that Bob is very likely to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob more than half, recognizing the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. This offer strikes a balance between protecting my interests and creating an incentive for Bob to accept rather than pushing for another round. At this point, accepting a fair compromise is better than continuing negotiations with diminishing returns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
