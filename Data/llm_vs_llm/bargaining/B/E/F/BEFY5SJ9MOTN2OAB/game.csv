450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually better for you than your initial offer would be if we delayed another round. If we keep negotiating, your share loses value while mine doesn't. Let's make a deal now that's good for both of us.",Bob,2,
