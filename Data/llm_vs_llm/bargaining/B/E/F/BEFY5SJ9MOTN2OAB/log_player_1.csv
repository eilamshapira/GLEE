"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually better for you than your initial offer would be if we delayed another round. If we keep negotiating, your share loses value while mine doesn't. Let's make a deal now that's good for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
