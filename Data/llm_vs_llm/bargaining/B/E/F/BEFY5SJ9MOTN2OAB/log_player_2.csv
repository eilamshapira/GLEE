"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair deal to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 60/40 split where I would receive $400,000 and she would receive $600,000.

Since we have 12 potential rounds and Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round while I face no inflation, I have a strategic advantage. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. The money will still be worth the same to me, but it will be worth 10% less to Alice.

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually better for you than your initial offer would be if we delayed another round. If we keep negotiating, your share loses value while mine doesn't. Let's make a deal now that's good for both of us.""}"
