"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I counter with a 51.25/48.75 split. This proposal gives me a slight edge as the proposer, but you receive nearly what you’d expect by waiting another round—avoiding further devaluation. Let’s agree now before the value drops further! 
# Alice gain: 48.75 
# Bob gain: 51.25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
