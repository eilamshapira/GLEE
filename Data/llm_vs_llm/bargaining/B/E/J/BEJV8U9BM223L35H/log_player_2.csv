"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount, but less than half of the total $1,000,000. Since I'll get to make a counter-offer if I reject, I could potentially get a better deal. However, Alice might then reject my offer, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that might lead to worse outcomes.

While $400,000 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer that gives me 40% of the total amount. The risk of rejection and potentially getting a worse deal in future rounds makes accepting this offer a rational choice.
