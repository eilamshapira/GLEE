"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 of the $100. If I reject and move to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but I'll be affected by 10% inflation, meaning the money will be worth less to me.

If I reject now, the $100 will effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round. This means I'd need to secure more than $44.44 ($40 รท 0.9) in my counter-offer to come out ahead.

Given that I'll have the opportunity to make my own offer in the next round, and I could potentially get more than what Alice is currently offering (even accounting for inflation), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer while accounting for the inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a reasonable counter-offer that gives me more than Alice's initial proposal, but still allows Alice to receive a substantial portion. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation, this round's $55 is worth about $49.5 to me in terms of first-round value, which is better than the $40 Alice initially offered."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze Alice's new offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $45. Due to the 19% inflation on my side, this $45 is actually worth $45 ร (1 - 0.19) = $36.45 in terms of first-round value.

In the previous round, Alice rejected my offer where I would get $55. If I reject again and move to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (likely 27-28%), which would significantly reduce the value of any money I receive.

Comparing this offer ($45 worth $36.45 to me) with Alice's initial offer ($40 with no inflation), this current offer is actually worse for me. However, given the increasing inflation and the fact that Alice has revealed she's also facing substantial inflation (36%), continuing to another round likely won't be beneficial.
