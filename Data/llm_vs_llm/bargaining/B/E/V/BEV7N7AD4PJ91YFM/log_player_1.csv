"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $70 and you receive $30. By agreeing now in round 1 we avoid any further inflation loss on my side. I believe this offer is fair and timely. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose a split of $60 for me and $40 for you. This is a much fairer division, especially considering we only have 12 rounds. Let's take this deal and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
