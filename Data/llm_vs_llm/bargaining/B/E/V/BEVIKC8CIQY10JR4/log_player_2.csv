"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the game conditions.

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (so $80 total). I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation.

Given the significant penalty for prolonging the game, and that $40 now is better than potentially less later if we keep rejecting each other's offers, this isn't a terrible offer.
