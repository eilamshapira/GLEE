"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, the inflation rates are different for us - my money loses 10% value per round, while Alice's loses 20% per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice would need to accept a lower amount than 50 to be better off than now. Since her 50 would be worth only 40 (20% less) next round, I could potentially offer her 41-45 and keep 55-59 for myself.

However, if she rejects my counter-offer, we'd go to round 3 where I'd face further inflation on my part as well. Given the inflation dynamics, it's generally better to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

A 50-50 split is fair, and there's risk in prolonging negotiations, so I'll accept.
