"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3103.45 
# Alice gain: 6896.55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation factor.

If I reject, we'll go to round 2 where I can make an offer, but the total value will be reduced by 10% for me and 5% for Alice.

Alice is currently offering me about 31% of the money ($3,103.45). This seems quite low since an even split would be $5,000 each. If I reject, I can propose a better split in the next round, but I'll be facing a 10% inflation penalty.

In the next round, the $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me and $9,500 to Alice. Given this asymmetric inflation, I should consider accepting if the offer is reasonable, but this offer gives Alice more than twice what I would receive.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our inflation rates. Since I face a higher inflation rate (10% per round) compared to Alice's 5%, I need to propose something reasonable that Alice would accept.

If Alice rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth even less to both of us, but especially to me. I'll propose a fair split that acknowledges the inflation difference.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This gives me a slight advantage but is much closer to an even split than Alice's initial offer. Since Alice has a lower inflation penalty, she should be incentivized to accept this rather than continue to another round where the total value decreases for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3456.79 
# Alice gain: 6543.21 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation.

Current situation:
- We're in round 3
- My inflation penalty is now 19% from the original value
- Alice's inflation penalty is 9.75% from the original value
- Alice is offering me $3,456.79, which is slightly better than her first offer ($3,103.45)
- She would get $6,543.21

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My inflation will increase further (likely to around 27%)
- Alice's inflation will increase to around 14.25%
- The gap between our inflation rates continues to widen

While Alice's offer is still giving her almost twice what I would get, it is better than her initial offer. Given the asymmetric inflation that disadvantages me more with each round, and considering that Alice has shown she's willing to reject more balanced offers, I should accept this offer before the money loses even more value for me.
