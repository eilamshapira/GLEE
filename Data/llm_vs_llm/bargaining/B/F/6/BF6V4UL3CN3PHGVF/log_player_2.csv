"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 6000$ and you getting 4000$. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation affects me more slowly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money is worth 20% less
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But Alice's money only devalues 10%
   * My $4000 now would be worth $3200 next round
   * Alice's $6000 would be worth $5400 next round

The devaluation rates put me at a disadvantage. While I could counter-offer, Alice knows she has better resistance to inflation and might reject, leading to further devaluation of my share.

$4000 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in subsequent rounds.
