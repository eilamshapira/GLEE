"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 60-40 split. Given the high inflation rate you face (20%), it's better to accept now rather than wait for the next round when the money will be worth less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, but your initial offer was too low. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 45/55 split. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $52.25
- If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  * Total value will decrease further (5% for me, 20% for Bob)
  * Bob is already showing willingness to negotiate
  * But there's risk of further rounds reducing value significantly

Given that Bob has moved towards a more reasonable split, and the inflation impact is significant, I should accept this offer. The $52.25 effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
