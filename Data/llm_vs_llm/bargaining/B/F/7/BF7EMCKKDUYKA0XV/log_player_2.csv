"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 60-40 split. Given the high inflation rate you face (20%), it's better to accept now rather than wait for the next round when the money will be worth less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
