"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose we split the money $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is slightly in my favor since I face higher inflation pressure, but it's still quite fair with Bob getting a substantial portion."
