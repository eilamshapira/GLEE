"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is a 40% share. While this isn't equal, there are a few considerations:

1. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me, meaning any amount will be worth less
2. Alice only faces 5% inflation per round, so she has less pressure to agree quickly
3. I have the advantage of making the next offer if I reject

However, with such a significant inflation difference (20% vs 5%), delaying might hurt me more than it hurts Alice. The 4000$ now is better than a potentially larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.
