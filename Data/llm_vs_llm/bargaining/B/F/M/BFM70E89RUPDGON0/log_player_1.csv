"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I see Bob is looking for a bit more than half. Taking into account the inflation effect on Bob's side, I'm offering a slightly adjusted split where Bob gets $5,500 and I get $4,500. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's position while still ensuring I receive a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I notice that due to inflation, Bob's gains are worth significantly less to him now - almost 50% less than in the first round. Taking this into account, I'm offering a split where Bob gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. This gives Bob a larger nominal amount to offset his inflation losses while still providing me with a reasonable share. This compromise should work better for both of us."
