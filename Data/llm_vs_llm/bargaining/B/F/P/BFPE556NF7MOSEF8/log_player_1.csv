Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want a good share, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a fair split would be beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's settle for an equal division. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
