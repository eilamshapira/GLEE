4000.0,6000.0,"Since money is worth 20% less to you now, this $4000 for you is fair considering time depreciation. This is better than waiting more rounds where your share will be worth even less.",Bob,2,

3000.0,7000.0,This $3000 is worth more to you now than waiting for future rounds where depreciation will continue at 20% per round. We should conclude this deal now to prevent further loss of value for your share.,Bob,4,

2500.0,7500.0,"Let's be practical - due to the 59% depreciation, waiting longer will only decrease the value of your share further. This $2500 now is worth more than a larger number in future rounds. We should conclude this before your share loses more value.",Bob,6,

2000.0,8000.0,"At this point, your $2000 now is worth more than $5400 from your last offer due to the severe depreciation of over 73%. Any further delays will only drastically reduce the real value of your share. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,8,
