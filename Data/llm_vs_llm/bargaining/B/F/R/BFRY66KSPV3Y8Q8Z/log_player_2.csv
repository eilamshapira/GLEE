"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. This is not an equal split, and since I know that:
1. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
2. The money loses 20% value for Alice each round
3. I can make a counter-offer next round

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this and making my own proposal next round. When I make my offer next round, Alice's portion will already be worth 20% less to her, which gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and we're now in round 2, any money she gets is worth only 80% of its original value to her. I can use this to make a more favorable offer while still making it attractive for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since money is worth 20% less to you now, this $4000 for you is fair considering time depreciation. This is better than waiting more rounds where your share will be worth even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering depreciation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,200, which is slightly better than her first offer of $4,000
2. She's taking $5,800, but for her, it's actually worth only 64% of its original value (due to 36% depreciation)
3. So for her, $5,800 is actually worth about $3,712 in round 1 terms
4. If I reject, we go to round 4, where her money will be worth even less (44% less than round 1)
5. However, since my money doesn't lose value, I can still push for a better deal

Given that I have negotiating leverage due to the asymmetric depreciation, and we still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since we're now in round 4, any money Alice gets is worth 44% less to her. This means she should be more inclined to accept a lower nominal amount now rather than risk further depreciation. I'll propose a split that takes this into account while still leaving her with a meaningful amount.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""This $3000 is worth more to you now than waiting for future rounds where depreciation will continue at 20% per round. We should conclude this deal now to prevent further loss of value for your share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, don't take advantage 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,400, which is a slight improvement from previous offers
2. She's taking $5,600, but for her it's worth only 40.96% of its original value due to 59.04% depreciation
3. So for her, $5,600 is actually worth about $2,294 in round 1 terms
4. The depreciation is becoming quite severe for Alice
5. However, my position is still strong since my money maintains its value

Given that:
- We're not even halfway through the available rounds
- The depreciation is severely impacting Alice's position
- My money maintains its value
- I can make an even stronger offer next round

I believe I should continue negotiating for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, Alice's share has lost almost 60% of its value, and will lose even more if she rejects. I'll make a strong offer that reflects my advantageous position while still giving her enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - due to the 59% depreciation, waiting longer will only decrease the value of your share further. This $2500 now is worth more than a larger number in future rounds. We should conclude this before your share loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't think I'll give up, still room for compromise 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,600 - a small increment from before
2. She wants $5,400, but it's worth only 26.21% of its original value (due to 73.79% depreciation)
3. So for her, $5,400 is actually worth only about $1,415 in round 1 terms
4. Her position is becoming extremely weak due to severe depreciation
5. We still have 5 rounds left, and her money will continue to lose value rapidly

Given that:
- The depreciation has severely eroded Alice's bargaining power
- Any further rounds will make her position even worse
- I can still make much stronger demands
- My money retains full value

I should continue pushing for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's share now worth less than 27% of its original value and continuing to depreciate rapidly, I'll make a strong offer that reflects the economic reality of our situation.

{""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""At this point, your $2000 now is worth more than $5400 from your last offer due to the severe depreciation of over 73%. Any further delays will only drastically reduce the real value of your share. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Not giving up yet, still hoping for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $4,800
2. She wants $5,200, but it's only worth 16.78% of its original value (due to 83.22% depreciation)
3. In round 1 terms, her $5,200 is worth only about $872
4. We have only 3 rounds left after this one
5. The depreciation is now extremely severe at over 83%

However, I should consider:
- Alice has shown she's willing to keep rejecting offers even with severe depreciation
- With only 3 rounds left, there's increasing risk of reaching round 12 where we both get nothing
- Getting $4,800 is better than risking getting nothing
- Alice has demonstrated she values fairness over pure economic rationality

Given these factors, especially the limited remaining rounds and risk of mutual loss, I should accept this offer.
