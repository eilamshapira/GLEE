"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, to keep things fair for both of us, let's split the amount evenly at 50-50. This way, we both gain equally despite the inflation you mentioned. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but due to the 5% inflation penalty I'm experiencing, my $50 is actually worth only $47.50 now. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for this depreciation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but due to 5% inflation each round, I now need a bit more to achieve actual equality. A 55-45 split would help offset my inflation losses while still giving you a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your inflation, I'll adjust the offer slightly to 48-52 in your favor. This should help offset the inflation while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I'm experiencing about 14.26% inflation (making my $52 worth about $44.58), continuing to negotiate would only decrease my value further due to inflation. Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and this is a reasonable settlement given the circumstances."
