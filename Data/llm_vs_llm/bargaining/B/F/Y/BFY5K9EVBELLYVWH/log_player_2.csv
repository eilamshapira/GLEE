"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and share it reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - The total value will be worth 5% less to me ($9500 effective value)
   - The total value will be worth 10% less to Alice ($9000 effective value)
   - I can make my own proposal

Since Alice's opening offer gives her a significant advantage (60%), and the inflation penalty for one round isn't too severe, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that the money is now worth less to both of us, and showing willingness to be fair:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal split. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money.""}"
