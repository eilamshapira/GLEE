"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000, keeping in mind the increasing disadvantage Bob faces each round due to inflation. I also need to consider that if we reach round 13 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Here's my first offer, designed to be appealing enough for Bob to accept now, given the rapidly eroding value of the money for him:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $4500 in the first round. While this seems like I'm taking the larger share, I believe this is a fair proposal considering that the value of money for him will degrade more quickly than it does for me. This offer gives Bob a strong incentive to accept now rather than risk a smaller, devalued amount later. I, on the other hand, get a slightly larger amount which seems reasonable considering my 'inflation rate' is 0%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob has proposed a 50/50 split. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round and Bob's inflation rate is 0%, this is more appealing than his inflation rate is 20%. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
