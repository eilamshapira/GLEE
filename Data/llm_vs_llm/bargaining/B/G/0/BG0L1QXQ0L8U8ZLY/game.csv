550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is a fair division that recognizes the time pressure we both face. If you reject, the next round will reduce the total value by more than what you might gain through negotiation. The money is worth 20% less to you next round while only 10% less to me, so this offer maximizes our combined utility.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is possible given the potential for further value loss.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both maximize our potential gains despite the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's finalize this deal now. We've both lost value due to negotiation delays. For you, the money is now worth only 64% of its original value (20% loss twice), while for me it's worth 81% (10% loss twice). If we delay another round, your share will lose value even faster than mine. This division maximizes our combined utility given our different inflation rates. Further negotiation will only hurt us both, especially you.",Alice,3,
