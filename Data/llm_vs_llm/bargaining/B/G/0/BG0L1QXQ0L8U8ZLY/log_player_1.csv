"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to propose a division where Bob gets enough that he won't want to counter-offer. Since each round reduces value (10% for me, 20% for Bob), Bob has a stronger incentive to accept early. Let me analyze the optimal offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair division that recognizes the time pressure we both face. If you reject, the next round will reduce the total value by more than what you might gain through negotiation. The money is worth 20% less to you next round while only 10% less to me, so this offer maximizes our combined utility.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is possible given the potential for further value loss.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both maximize our potential gains despite the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to consider that we're now in round 3, so both Bob and I have lost value. I should propose an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and makes acceptance rational for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's finalize this deal now. We've both lost value due to negotiation delays. For you, the money is now worth only 64% of its original value (20% loss twice), while for me it's worth 81% (10% loss twice). If we delay another round, your share will lose value even faster than mine. This division maximizes our combined utility given our different inflation rates. Further negotiation will only hurt us both, especially you.""}"
