3100.0,6900.0,"Alice, due to our differing discount rates (my money losing value by 5% per round versus your 10%), waiting hurts us both. Based on a fair bargaining calculation, I propose a 69%-31% split in nominal dollars (I get $6900 and you get $3100) in round 2. This division reflects the future value loss we’d suffer if we continue. I believe this offer is fair given our circumstances—please accept it.",Bob,2,
