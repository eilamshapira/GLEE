"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, due to our differing discount rates (my money losing value by 5% per round versus your 10%), waiting hurts us both. Based on a fair bargaining calculation, I propose a 69%-31% split in nominal dollars (I get $6900 and you get $3100) in round 2. This division reflects the future value loss we’d suffer if we continue. I believe this offer is fair given our circumstances—please accept it. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $3100 × 0.9 = $2790 in round 1 value
- If I reject and propose 60-40 again next round:
  * Money will be worth even less (20% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
  * Bob might reject again, leading to further losses
- Bob's reasoning about different discount rates is valid
- The longer we negotiate, the worse position I'll be in due to my higher inflation rate
