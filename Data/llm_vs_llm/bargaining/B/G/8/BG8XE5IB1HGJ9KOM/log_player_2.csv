"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, due to our differing discount rates (my money losing value by 5% per round versus your 10%), waiting hurts us both. Based on a fair bargaining calculation, I propose a 69%-31% split in nominal dollars (I get $6,900 and you get $3,100) in round 2. This division reflects the future value loss we’d suffer if we continue. I believe this offer is fair given our circumstances—please accept it.""}"
