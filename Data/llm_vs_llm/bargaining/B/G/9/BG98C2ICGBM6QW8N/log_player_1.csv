I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a 55/45 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal at this point.  Hopefully Bob is feeling the pinch too and will accept this fair offer."
