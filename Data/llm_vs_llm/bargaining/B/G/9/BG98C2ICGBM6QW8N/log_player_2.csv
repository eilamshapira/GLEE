Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to being more equitable, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Accepting a slightly worse offer now is better than risking getting a much worse offer later, or even ending up with nothing."

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. A 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting a worse offer or reaching no agreement and getting nothing."
