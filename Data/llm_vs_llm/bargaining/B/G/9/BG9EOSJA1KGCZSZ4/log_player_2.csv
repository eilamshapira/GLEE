"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I would gain is actually worth about 64% of its original value, which is approximately $288,000 in round 1 terms.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor, but the inflation is starting to hurt me. I'll have to weigh my options carefully.
