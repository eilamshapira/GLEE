Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed. How about we split it 55 for me and 45 for you? This is more fair, and accounts for the fact that the money is worth less to me now since you rejected my first offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
