"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to start. It's a fair offer considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money would be worth 10% less to me.

Given that inflation affects me by 10% each round, if I reject now and propose in round 2, the maximum value I could get would be 90% of the original value. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

Since $400,000 is a substantial portion and avoiding the inflation penalty seems prudent, I'll accept this offer.
