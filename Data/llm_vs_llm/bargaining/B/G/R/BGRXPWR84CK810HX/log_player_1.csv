"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this game using concepts from game theory:

1) We need to split $10,000 between us.
2) If we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing.
3) Money loses value each round - 5% for me and 10% for Bob.
4) Bob loses value faster, so later rounds hurt him more than me.

Since this is round 1, I'll make a fair initial offer but slightly favor myself since I have better bargaining power due to the differential inflation rates.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep things simple and fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit and don't risk losing more as time goes on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
