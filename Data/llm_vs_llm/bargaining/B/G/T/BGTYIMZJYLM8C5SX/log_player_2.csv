"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
* While $4,000 is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total
* Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I can safely negotiate for a better deal
* I could propose a more equitable split in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still give a slight advantage to Alice to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

My reasoning:
1. This is a more equitable split (48%-52%)
2. Alice still gets a slight advantage which might make her more likely to accept
3. It's a significant improvement over the previous offer for me
4. If Alice rejects, she'll need to make another offer, and we know she's willing to accept uneven splits based on her first offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* She's offering me $4,200 (42% of total)
* It's a slight improvement from her first offer ($4,000)
* Due to inflation, her $5,800 is actually worth $4,698 (5800 * 0.81) to her
* I'm not affected by inflation, so my $4,200 is still worth full value
* The effective split is now closer to 47% for me and 53% for her (in real value)
* If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make an offer, but Alice's inflation will increase further

This offer is getting more reasonable due to inflation effects, and Alice has shown some movement from her initial position. However, I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice is experiencing inflation (now at 19%) while I'm not, I'll make a strategic offer that appears favorable to her nominal value but accounts for the inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100}

My reasoning:
1. The nominal split looks close to 50-50 (49%-51%), which appears very fair
2. Given Alice's 19% inflation, her 5100 is worth about 4131 to her
3. This makes the real value split approximately 54% for me, 46% for her
4. It's still better for her to accept this than to go another round where inflation will hurt her more
5. I've increased my position gradually (from 4800 to 4900) to show willingness to negotiate but also firmness"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer with the increased inflation:
* She's offering me $4,300 (43% of total)
* Due to the 34.39% inflation, her $5,700 is actually worth only $3,740 to her (5700 * 0.6561)
* I'm not affected by inflation, so my $4,300 is worth full value
* In real value terms, the split is now approximately 53.5% for me and 46.5% for her
* The inflation is significantly impacting Alice's position
* If I reject, we'll go to another round where Alice's inflation will increase even further

Given that:
1. The real value split is now in my favor
2. Further negotiations might lead to mutual loss of value
3. The nominal amount for me ($4,300) is a reasonable improvement from previous offers
4. Alice is already taking a significant hit from inflation
