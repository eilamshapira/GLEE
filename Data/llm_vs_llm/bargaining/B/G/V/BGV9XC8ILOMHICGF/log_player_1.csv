"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fairer split. Consider that if you reject, in the next round the $1M will be worth 5% less to you (only $950000). This offer gives you a guaranteed $400000 now, which is more than what you'd likely get if we continue negotiating with declining value for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
