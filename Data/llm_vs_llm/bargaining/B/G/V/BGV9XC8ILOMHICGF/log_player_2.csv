"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is quite unbalanced in Alice's favor. She's offering me only $1,000 out of the total $1,000,000, keeping $999,000 for herself. Since there's no inflation penalty for me between rounds, and Alice faces a 5% depreciation with each round, I have a strategic advantage by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fairer split. Consider that if you reject, in the next round the $1M will be worth 5% less to you (only $950,000). This offer gives you a guaranteed $400,000 now, which is more than what you'd likely get if we continue negotiating with declining value for you.""}"
