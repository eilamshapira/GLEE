Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to propose a more balanced split that takes into account the inflation risk I'm facing. Since I have a 5% inflation penalty per round, I'm suggesting we divide the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer considering I'll lose value if we continue to additional rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
