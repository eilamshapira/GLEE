"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be reasonable and hopefully accepted by Bob, considering the rapid inflation I'm facing:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation of my reasoning:**

*   **Alice's Perspective:** I'm proposing 60% because my money is devaluing much faster than Bob's (20% vs 5%). I need to secure a larger share early to compensate for this.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Offering Bob 40% in the first round is a generous offer. The money won't devalue as much for Bob compared to Alice (5%), so it gives him an incentive to accept.

I'm aiming for a quick resolution to minimize my losses due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob finds this a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think this through carefully.

*   **My current situation:** Another round means my money is worth even less (now 40% less than the initial value).
*   **Bob's offer:** He's offering me $45.

Let's calculate the value of this offer to me, compared to my initial offer.

In round 1, I asked for $60. Let's say that represents 100% value.

Now, in Round 2, I would have to get $60/0.80 (or $75) to match the value of round 1. Since I am only getting $45, it is a low offer. But what are the alternatives?
However, I have to consider that if I reject it, it means further devaluation of my gains.

The most important question is ""is 45 better than what I would expect to get if I went to round 3?"".
The problem is, I don't know what will happen in round 3, or if it will be worse than this. I also have to consider that there will be a final ""nothing"" payoff after round 12.

I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
