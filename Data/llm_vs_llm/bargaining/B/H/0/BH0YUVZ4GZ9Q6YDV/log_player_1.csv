"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob faces a 10% loss in value each round, I can use this to negotiate strategically. If Bob rejects my offer, anything he gets in the next round will be worth 10% less to him. I'll offer a division that's slightly in my favor but still attractive enough considering the time pressure on Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth less, and we might end up in a back-and-forth that reduces the value for him significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000, and taking $550,000 for himself
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $550,000 is actually worth only $495,000 to him (90% of $550,000)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth only 80% of the original value
   - My money keeps its full value

Since I can make the next offer and Bob's money will be worth even less next round, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer. Bob will be under more pressure to accept my next offer due to increasing inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth only 80% of its original value, which gives me more leverage. If Bob rejects this offer, his money in the next round will only be worth 70% of the original value. I'll make an offer that takes this into account but is still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This means:
- I get $650,000 (full value)
- Bob gets $350,000 (worth $280,000 to him due to 20% inflation)
If Bob rejects this, any money he gets next round will be worth even less (only 70% of face value), so this should be attractive enough for him to accept while giving me a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $420,000 (at full value)
2. Bob would get $580,000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth only $422,820 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 5, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth even less (about 34.4% less than original value)
   - My money keeps its full value

Since I can make the next offer and Bob's money will be worth significantly less next round, I should reject this offer. The decreasing value of Bob's money gives me increasing leverage to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now we're in round 5, and Bob's money is worth only about 65.6% of its original value. This gives me even stronger leverage. If Bob rejects this offer, his money in the next round will be worth even less. I'll make an offer that takes advantage of this situation while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This means:
- I get $700,000 (full value)
- Bob gets $300,000 (worth about $196,800 to him due to 34.4% inflation)

This offer should be compelling for Bob because:
1. If he rejects, any money he gets next round will be worth even less
2. The actual value he's getting ($196,800) is still significant
3. Further negotiations will only decrease the real value of his share"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $400,000 (at full value)
2. Bob would get $600,000, but due to 40.95% inflation, it's worth only $354,300 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 7, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 46.86% less than original value
   - My money keeps its full value

Since:
- The offer to me is lower than previous rounds
- I can make the next offer
- Bob's money continues to rapidly lose value
- I have no inflation pressure

I should reject this offer and make a more aggressive offer in the next round, as Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now in round 7, Bob's money is worth only about 53.14% of its original value (a 46.86% decrease). His position is significantly weaker, and any further delays will continue to erode the value of his share. I'll make an even stronger offer in my favor that still gives Bob enough incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

This means:
- I get $750,000 (full value)
- Bob gets $250,000 (worth about $132,850 to him due to 46.86% inflation)

Bob should accept this because:
1. If he rejects, his money in the next round will be worth even less (around 52% less than original value)
2. Further negotiations will only decrease the real value of his share more dramatically
3. The actual value he's getting ($132,850) is still better than risking another round of devaluation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $380,000 (at full value)
2. Bob would get $620,000, but due to 52.17% inflation, it's worth only $296,546 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 9, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 56.95% less than original value
   - My money keeps its full value

Since:
- This offer ($380,000) is even lower than Bob's previous offer of $400,000
- Bob's money continues to rapidly lose value
- I have no inflation pressure
- I can make an even stronger offer next round

I should reject this offer. Bob's position continues to weaken substantially with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 9, Bob's money is worth only about 43.05% of its original value (a 56.95% decrease). His negotiating position has become extremely weak, as any further delays will make his share worth even less. I'll make a strong offer that reflects this reality while still giving him enough value to prefer accepting over continuing.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

This means:
- I get $800,000 (full value)
- Bob gets $200,000 (worth only about $86,100 to him due to 56.95% inflation)

Bob should accept this because:
1. If he rejects, his money in the next round will be worth even less (about 61.26% less than original value)
2. The real value of his share is rapidly approaching zero with each round
3. Even this reduced amount is better than risking another round of severe devaluation
4. Further negotiation rounds will only worsen his position while mine remains unchanged"
