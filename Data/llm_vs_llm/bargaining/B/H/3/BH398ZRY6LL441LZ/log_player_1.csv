"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This gives us each $500,000, which is an equitable division that recognizes we both have equal power in this negotiation. A fair split avoids unnecessary rounds of negotiation where the total amount would decrease due to the 5% inflation penalty."
