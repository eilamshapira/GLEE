"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, offering Bob half of the total amount.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

An equal split is fair and has a good chance of being accepted, avoiding the need for further rounds of negotiation. Since I know inflation doesn't affect my gains, but I'm uncertain about Bob's situation, a 50-50 split is a reasonable starting point."
