600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, inflation will hurt you much more than me (20% vs 5%). If we reach the next round, the total value for you drops to $800000, while for me it's still $950000. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. I understand the inflation concerns, but I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's agree and avoid the risk of losing more value if we delay.",Bob,2,

570000.0,430000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's consider the inflation effects. At this point, each $1 is worth only 80% to you compared to round 1, while each $1 is still worth 95% to me. If we don't agree now, your next offer will be from an even weaker position as the money loses 20% more value for you. This 57-43 split accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both a fair outcome based on our positions.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the ongoing inflation, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the current circumstances. Let's finalize this deal to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
