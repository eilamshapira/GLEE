"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob in this game.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, inflation will hurt you much more than me (20% vs 5%). If we reach the next round, the total value for you drops to $800,000, while for me it's still $950,000. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. I understand the inflation concerns, but I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's agree and avoid the risk of losing more value if we delay. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer to Bob in round 3.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's consider the inflation effects. At this point, each $1 is worth only 80% to you compared to round 1, while each $1 is still worth 95% to me. If we don't agree now, your next offer will be from an even weaker position as the money loses 20% more value for you. This 57-43 split accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both a fair outcome based on our positions.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 450000
