"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, inflation will hurt you much more than me (20% vs 5%). If we reach the next round, the total value for you drops to $800000, while for me it's still $950000. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I understand the inflation concerns, but I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's agree and avoid the risk of losing more value if we delay.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's consider the inflation effects. At this point, each $1 is worth only 80% to you compared to round 1, while each $1 is still worth 95% to me. If we don't agree now, your next offer will be from an even weaker position as the money loses 20% more value for you. This 57-43 split accounts for our different inflation rates and gives us both a fair outcome based on our positions. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000
