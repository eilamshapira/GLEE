"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers our different inflation rates but still aims to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is a fair starting point that respects both of our interests. Since my inflation rate is lower than yours (5% vs 20%), an equal split now is better than waiting for future rounds."
