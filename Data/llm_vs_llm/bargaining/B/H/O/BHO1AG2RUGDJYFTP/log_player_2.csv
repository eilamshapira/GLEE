"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the million dollars. This seems fair to both of us, and we can avoid prolonged negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal for an equal split.

Her offer is for us to each receive $500,000, which is perfectly fair and equitable. This seems like a reasonable starting proposal that respects both of our interests equally.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and risk getting nothing if we can't agree, accepting a fair 50/50 split right away would be the most rational choice.
