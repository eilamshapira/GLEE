5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split the money evenly. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair split now benefits us both more than negotiating further.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer for a fair split, but consider my proposal: I receive $6000 and you get $4000. This compensates for the 20% inflation you face each round, balancing our potential losses better over time.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand we both want a fair deal considering the inflation penalty I face. I'm suggesting $5500 for me and $4500 for you, which accounts for some of my inflation risk while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value with each round, and you risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Thanks for trying to meet halfway, Alice. Considering your inflation loss, how about you take $4500? It accounts for part of your inflation loss, while still being fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now to avoid potential losses in future rounds.",Bob,4,
