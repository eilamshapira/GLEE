"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair split now benefits us both more than negotiating further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer for a fair split, but consider my proposal: I receive $6000 and you get $4000. This compensates for the 20% inflation you face each round, balancing our potential losses better over time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand we both want a fair deal considering the inflation penalty I face. I'm suggesting $5500 for me and $4500 for you, which accounts for some of my inflation risk while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value with each round, and you risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for trying to meet halfway, Alice. Considering your inflation loss, how about you take $4500? It accounts for part of your inflation loss, while still being fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now to avoid potential losses in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
