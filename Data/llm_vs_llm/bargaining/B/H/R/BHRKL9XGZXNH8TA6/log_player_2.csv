"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, a fair split now benefits us both more than negotiating further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer for a fair split, but consider my proposal: I receive $6,000 and you get $4,000. This compensates for the 20% inflation you face each round, balancing our potential losses better over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we both want a fair deal considering the inflation penalty I face. I'm suggesting $5500 for me and $4500 for you, which accounts for some of my inflation risk while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value with each round, and you risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Thanks for trying to meet halfway, Alice. Considering your inflation loss, how about you take $4,500? It accounts for part of your inflation loss, while still being fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now to avoid potential losses in future rounds.""}"
