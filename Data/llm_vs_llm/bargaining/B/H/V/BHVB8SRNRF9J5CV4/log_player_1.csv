"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the 10% depreciation per round that affects Bob's value. Since Bob is rational and understands this depreciation, he should be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair offer because:
1. It gives Bob a substantial portion ($400,000)
2. If Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth 10% less to him
3. The split is clear and simple (60-40)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. For me, the $500,000 is worth full value
3. For Bob, his $500,000 is actually worth only 90% of the original value due to inflation
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in the next round, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. This is actually a reasonable offer - I get half of the money at full value

Given that:
- The offer gives me a significant amount
- Further negotiations might lead to more hostile positions
- We have limited rounds and risk getting nothing
- This is a fair split in absolute terms
