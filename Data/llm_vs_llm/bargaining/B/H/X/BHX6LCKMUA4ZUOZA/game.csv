344827.0,655173.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I get $344827 and you get $655173. This split takes into account our different discount rates for future rounds—any delay will cost us both, though you lose less per round than I do. Accepting now guarantees us these effective shares before the money loses more value.",Alice,1,
