Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I get $344827 and you get $655173. This split takes into account our different discount rates for future rounds—any delay will cost us both, though you lose less per round than I do. Accepting now guarantees us these effective shares before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 655173 
# Alice gain: 344827
