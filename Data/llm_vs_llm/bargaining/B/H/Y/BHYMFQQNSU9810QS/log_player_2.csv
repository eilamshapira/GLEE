"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. If negotiations drag on, the value could decrease significantly

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. $400,000 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where the real value decreases.
