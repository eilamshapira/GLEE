"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this division because:
1. It's close to an equal split, which appears fair
2. Giving Bob a slightly larger share (52%) increases the likelihood of acceptance
3. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to be generous in the first round
4. This demonstrates good faith while still securing a significant portion for myself"
