Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, considering the potential for many rounds and the inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

My rationale is that this is a slightly better split for me than Alice initially proposed, while still giving her a substantial amount. I'm hoping she'll see the value in securing $450,000 now rather than risking further rounds and potential inflation on her end (even though I don't know if she experiences it)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, my offer in round 4 is:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""alice_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm lowering my ask slightly, given that we've already had two rounds and I'm facing inflation. I still need to try and get a worthwhile amount, but hopefully, this is a more palatable offer for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```

Okay, a straight 50/50 split. My money is losing value significantly, and we're halfway through the rounds. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing. I hope Alice sees the same logic."
