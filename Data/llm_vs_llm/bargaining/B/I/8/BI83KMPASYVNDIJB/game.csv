60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's start with a more balanced proposal. I suggest 55 for me and 45 for you. We both lose money with each round due to inflation, so let's try to reach an agreement now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, considering the inflation effect on my side (now 20% less value for me), I need a higher nominal amount to reach a fair deal. This 55-45 split would actually be worth only 44 to me due to inflation. It's a reasonable compromise - let's make a deal now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, I'm also experiencing inflation. Let's try to meet in the middle. I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. This is a small concession from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can both agree on this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, the inflation is seriously impacting my end of the deal. With 34.2% inflation now, even 58 dollars would only be worth about 38.2 dollars to me in real value. This offer gives you 42 dollars while helping me offset some of my inflation losses. Please consider accepting so we don't both lose more value to inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, the inflation is hurting us both. I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer, and we should take it before the money becomes worthless.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, with the inflation now at 46.86% for me, I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair deal. Even with 65 dollars, I would only receive about 34.6 dollars in real value due to inflation. Your 35 dollars might be worth more in real terms depending on your inflation rate. Please accept this offer before inflation erodes our potential gains even further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, I know the inflation is tough. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't accept 35. I'm proposing 48 for me, 52 for you. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing for both of us.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, we only have a few rounds left and we both risk getting nothing. With my inflation now at 56.95%, even 70 dollars would only be worth about 30.1 dollars to me in real value. Your 30 dollars might still have better purchasing power depending on your inflation rate. This is my best attempt at finding a fair split considering my severe inflation penalty. Please accept so we don't both end up with zero.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, this is getting critical. I'm offering 45 for me and 55 for you. I know it's not what either of us initially wanted, but we are running out of time and the money is losing value fast. Let's just agree on this and move on.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With my inflation at 65.13%, even 75 dollars is only worth about 26.2 dollars to me in real value. If we don't reach an agreement now, we risk getting nothing in the next round. Your 25 dollars might still have decent purchasing power depending on your inflation rate. Please accept this offer - it's better than both of us walking away with zero.",Alice,11,
