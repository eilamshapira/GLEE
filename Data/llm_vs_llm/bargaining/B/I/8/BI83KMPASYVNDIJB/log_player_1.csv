"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more balanced proposal. I suggest 55 for me and 45 for you. We both lose money with each round due to inflation, so let's try to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 10% less for me now, so 45 would actually be worth 40.5 to me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that considers this inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation effect on my side (now 20% less value for me), I need a higher nominal amount to reach a fair deal. This 55-45 split would actually be worth only 44 to me due to inflation. It's a reasonable compromise - let's make a deal now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, I'm also experiencing inflation. Let's try to meet in the middle. I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. This is a small concession from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can both agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 27.1% inflation for me, the 48 dollars would only be worth about 35 dollars in real value. I need to aim for a better nominal amount to compensate for this growing inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is seriously impacting my end of the deal. With 34.2% inflation now, even 58 dollars would only be worth about 38.2 dollars to me in real value. This offer gives you 42 dollars while helping me offset some of my inflation losses. Please consider accepting so we don't both lose more value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hurting us both. I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer, and we should take it before the money becomes worthless. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 40.95% inflation for me, the 50 dollars would only be worth about 29.5 dollars in real value. Even though a 50/50 split might seem fair nominally, the inflation effect makes it quite unfavorable for me. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for this significant inflation impact."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, with the inflation now at 46.86% for me, I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair deal. Even with 65 dollars, I would only receive about 34.6 dollars in real value due to inflation. Your 35 dollars might be worth more in real terms depending on your inflation rate. Please accept this offer before inflation erodes our potential gains even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the inflation is tough. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't accept 35. I'm proposing 48 for me, 52 for you. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 52.17% inflation for me, the 52 dollars would only be worth about 24.9 dollars in real value. Even though Bob is offering me the larger share nominally, the inflation effect makes this a poor deal for me. We're running out of rounds, but I still need to try for a better offer to compensate for this severe inflation impact."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, we only have a few rounds left and we both risk getting nothing. With my inflation now at 56.95%, even 70 dollars would only be worth about 30.1 dollars to me in real value. Your 30 dollars might still have better purchasing power depending on your inflation rate. This is my best attempt at finding a fair split considering my severe inflation penalty. Please accept so we don't both end up with zero.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting critical. I'm offering 45 for me and 55 for you. I know it's not what either of us initially wanted, but we are running out of time and the money is losing value fast. Let's just agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 61.26% inflation for me, the 55 dollars would only be worth about 21.3 dollars in real value. We only have two rounds left after this, but this offer is still too low given my severe inflation penalty. I need to make one more attempt at a better deal, even though we're risking ending up with nothing."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With my inflation at 65.13%, even 75 dollars is only worth about 26.2 dollars to me in real value. If we don't reach an agreement now, we risk getting nothing in the next round. Your 25 dollars might still have decent purchasing power depending on your inflation rate. Please accept this offer - it's better than both of us walking away with zero.""}"
