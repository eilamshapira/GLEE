"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split, which I believe is fair. Let's avoid further delay and potential losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less
   * Maximum I could get would be $95 (worth $90.25 after inflation)
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The 60/40 split, while not perfectly equal, gives me a decent amount without risking inflation losses. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation and extended negotiation.
