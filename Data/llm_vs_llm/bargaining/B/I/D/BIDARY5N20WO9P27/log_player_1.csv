"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's propose an equal split. This way, we both benefit fairly without feeling either is favored over the other. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
