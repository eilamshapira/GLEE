"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of total)
2. She's taking 6000$ (60% of total)
3. It's the first round, so I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. A more equitable split would be closer to 50-50

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer, but slightly in my favor since Alice's first offer was quite uneven:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a more balanced proposal giving me 55% and Alice 45%, which is fairer than her initial 60-40 split in her favor. It shows I'm willing to be more reasonable while still maintaining a slight advantage for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice has moved from her initial 6000/4000 split to a 5500/4500 split
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate
3. However, it's still early in the game (round 3 of 12)
4. She's essentially reversed my previous offer in her favor
5. I believe we can reach a more equitable 50-50 split

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll continue negotiating for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll move towards a more equitable split to show good faith and encourage cooperation:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly fair 50-50 split. It shows I'm reasonable and willing to meet in the middle. Since we're still early in the negotiation (round 4 of 12), this offer demonstrates that I'm prioritizing fairness over advantage, which might encourage Alice to accept."
