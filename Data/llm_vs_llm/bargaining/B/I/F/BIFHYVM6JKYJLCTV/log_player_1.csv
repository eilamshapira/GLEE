"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the risk of waiting, but still offers Bob a significant amount to encourage acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual value of the $500,000 offered to me by Bob in this round is $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

Considering Bob's offer gives us an equal split, but taking into account the inflation, I should evaluate if this is a good deal for me. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, and Bob's offer does not significantly favor me, I should consider accepting to avoid further devaluation.
