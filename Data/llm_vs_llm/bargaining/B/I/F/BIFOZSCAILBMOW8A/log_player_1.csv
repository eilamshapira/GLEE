"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since your money will be worth 5% less in this round due to inflation, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that accounts for this. This 55/45 split actually gives you equivalent value to what you'd have received in round 1, while recognizing the time value factor in our game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
