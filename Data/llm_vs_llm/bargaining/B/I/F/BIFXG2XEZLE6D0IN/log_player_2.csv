"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this early. I propose that I receive $60 and you get $40. Accepting now avoids any uncertainty about future value â€“ a quick agreement benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So the $100 pot would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

Given this inflation effect, accepting $40 now might be better than rejecting and potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.
