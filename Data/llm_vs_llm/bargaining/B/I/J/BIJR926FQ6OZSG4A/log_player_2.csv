"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair split
3. While there's no inflation impact for me, continuing to negotiate might not lead to a better outcome
4. Taking a fair offer in the first round is generally a good strategy
5. Even if I counter-offer, Alice might reject, leading to more rounds without guaranteed better results

Given these factors, accepting this fair offer is the most rational choice.
