"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I need to propose a division of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I want to maximize my gains while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept it now.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for $600,000. This is a slight advantage for me in this initial round.
*   I'm giving Bob $400,000. This is a substantial amount, and it might be tempting for him to accept it rather than risk future rounds where he might get less.
*   I prioritize securing a good portion early to mitigate the impact of inflation.

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. Let me know what he says!"
