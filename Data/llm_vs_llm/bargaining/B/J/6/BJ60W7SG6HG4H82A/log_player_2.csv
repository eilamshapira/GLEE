"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. This isn't an even split, but I should also consider the 5% inflation penalty if I reject and we go to another round.

If I reject, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a 50/50 split in the next round, that would be $47.50 for me, which is better than the current $40 offer.

Based on this calculation, I think I can get a better outcome by making a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that slightly favors me since I'm facing 5% inflation with each round. This is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate with diminishing returns.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $43, which is better than her initial $40 offer. Due to inflation, the value to me is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so my $43 is actually worth about $38.81 to me in original value.

If I reject and go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (likely around 15% less than the original value). Even if I proposed a better split, the continued devaluation would likely result in less actual value for me.

Additionally, Alice seems to know she has the advantage with the inflation only affecting me, and she's only improved her offer slightly.

Given these factors, it makes sense to accept this offer rather than continue negotiating with increasing inflation penalties.
