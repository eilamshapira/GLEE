"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation and the limited number of rounds:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering a slightly larger portion to myself, but still giving Bob a significant amount that he hopefully will find acceptable. I'm trying to avoid a quick rejection that would lead to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to carefully consider this offer.

*   **My Perspective:** If I accept, I get $40. If I reject, the money devalues by another 20% next round.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is offering me a relatively small amount, perhaps banking on my fear of further devaluation.

Let's calculate the relative value of $40 now compared to potential future gains. If I reject this and make a proposal next round, the maximum I could get is $100, but it would be worth 40% less than the original $100, resulting in max $60 value (100 - 40% of 100 = 60). But I will be very risky to propose that as Bob will likely reject it and we get nothing.
$40 now seems like a reasonably safe choice.
