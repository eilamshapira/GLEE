"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me only 5% of the total amount ($50,000), while keeping 95% ($950,000) for herself. This is a very unfair split.

Given that Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth less to Alice while maintaining full value for me.

I'll reject this unfair offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round and I don't, I'll propose a more equitable split, but one that still gives me an advantage. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is much fairer than her initial proposal while taking advantage of my stronger negotiating position.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

My proposal is to give me $600,000 and Alice $400,000. This is a much more reasonable split than her initial offer, and given that the money is worth 5% less to her now, she should be incentivized to accept rather than risk further depreciation of her share in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has significantly improved her offer from the first round (from offering me $50K to $350K)
2. Her $650K share is actually worth only ~$586,625 to her due to the 9.75% inflation she faces
3. My $350K maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   - I can make another offer
   - But Alice's share will depreciate further (by 14.75%)
   - She might become more aggressive in negotiations

While I could try to push for an even better deal, $350K is a substantial improvement from her initial offer. The risk of prolonging negotiations might lead to more aggressive behavior from Alice as her potential gains keep decreasing in value.
