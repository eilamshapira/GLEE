"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round but Bob isn't, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a generous offer for Bob, as he gets a substantial portion, and it's better than risking future rounds where we might both lose out due to my inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer of giving me nothing is completely unfair. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should make a counter-offer in the next round. At worst, my next proposal would be worth 90% of the original value to me, which is still much better than accepting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob showed extreme aggression with a 0-1000000 split, I need to adjust my strategy. The money is now worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so I need to secure a deal soon while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Bob compared to my first offer, moving from 60-40 to 55-45. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and acknowledge his position, while still maintaining a fair share for myself. With the 20% inflation penalty, my $550,000 is actually worth $440,000 to me now, but that's still much better than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the 27.1% inflation penalty, $10,000 is far too low of an offer. My $10,000 would only be worth about $7,290 after inflation, while Bob keeps $990,000. I'll make another offer in the next round where, even with a 30% inflation penalty, I can still secure a much better deal than this extremely unfair proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's aggressive negotiation style and the increasing inflation pressure (now about 30% for me), I need to make a more conciliatory offer while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfect 50-50 split. Even with the 30% inflation penalty, my $500,000 would be worth about $350,000 to me, which is still significantly better than Bob's last lowball offer. This equal split demonstrates fairness and should be harder for Bob to reject on principle. If Bob rejects this balanced offer, it reveals that he's not interested in fair negotiation, and I'll need to adjust my strategy further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is clearly not negotiating in good faith, offering me just $1 (which would be worth about $0.59 after the 40.95% inflation). Even with increasing inflation, making a counter-offer gives me a chance at a better outcome than accepting virtually nothing. The inflation penalty is becoming severe, but accepting $1 would be worse than trying one more time with a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's extremely aggressive behavior and the severe inflation (now about 45% for me), I need to make a more significant concession while still trying to secure a meaningful amount.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm now offering Bob a 60-40 split in his favor. With my 45% inflation penalty, my $400,000 would be worth about $220,000 to me, which is still far better than Bob's insulting $1 offer. By giving Bob the larger share, I'm showing significant willingness to compromise while still maintaining a meaningful portion for myself. If Bob rejects this favorable offer to him, it's clear he's simply trying to run out the clock on inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 430467 
# Bob gain: 569533 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 52.17% inflation penalty, my $430,467 would be worth about $205,902, which is actually a reasonable offer given the circumstances. This is better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting an even worse offer. Bob has finally made a legitimate offer after several rounds of extreme lowball offers, and given the mounting inflation pressure, this is a acceptable outcome for me."
