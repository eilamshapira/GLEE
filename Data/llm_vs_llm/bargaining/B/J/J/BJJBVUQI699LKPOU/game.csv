600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this quickly and both walk away with a substantial amount!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing this round. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and we both still walk away with significant amounts. Let's settle here and avoid further inflation losses.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting me harder. I need 650k to make this worthwhile. Let's get this done.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is hitting you much harder (36% vs my 9.75% in the last round). If we continue, your position weakens significantly more than mine. This 60/40 split in my favor is fair considering the asymmetric inflation and would still give you $400000, which is much better than continuing to the next round where inflation will reduce your value further. Let's end this now to our mutual benefit.",Bob,4,
