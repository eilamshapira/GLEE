Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing this round. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and we both still walk away with significant amounts. Let's settle here and avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is hitting you much harder (36% vs my 9.75% in the last round). If we continue, your position weakens significantly more than mine. This 60/40 split in my favor is fair considering the asymmetric inflation and would still give you $400000, which is much better than continuing to the next round where inflation will reduce your value further. Let's end this now to our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
