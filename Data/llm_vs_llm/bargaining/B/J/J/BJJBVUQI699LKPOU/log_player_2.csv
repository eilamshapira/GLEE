"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this quickly and both walk away with a substantial amount! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing I get $400,000 (40%) while she gets $600,000 (60%). 

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, but inflation will reduce the value by 5%. The total pot would effectively be worth $950,000 to me, so even if I proposed a 50/50 split, I'd get $475,000 in perceived value.

Since $475,000 > $400,000, and I have the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since we're in round 2, I need to consider that the money is worth 5% less to me now, but I can propose a division that compensates for this inflation effect while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing this round. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and we both still walk away with significant amounts. Let's settle here and avoid further inflation losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting me harder. I need 650k to make this worthwhile. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is now offering me $350,000 while taking $650,000.

Important new information: Alice revealed that inflation is affecting her much more severely (36% by round 3) than it's affecting me (9.75% by round 3).

If I reject and go to round 4, the money will be worth 14.5% less to me (assuming another 5% reduction). With this asymmetric inflation, Alice is under much more pressure to settle quickly.

Since her inflation rate is so high, I can likely get a better deal in the next round when I make the offer. The $350,000 offer is less than what I rejected in round 1 ($400,000), and given her severe inflation penalty, I have leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the new information about our different inflation rates, I need to make a strategic offer. Alice is facing 36% inflation by round 3, which means her situation worsens much faster than mine with each round. I'll use this leverage while still making an offer she should reasonably accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is hitting you much harder (36% vs my 9.75% in the last round). If we continue, your position weakens significantly more than mine. This 60/40 split in my favor is fair considering the asymmetric inflation and would still give you $400,000, which is much better than continuing to the next round where inflation will reduce your value further. Let's end this now to our mutual benefit.""}"
