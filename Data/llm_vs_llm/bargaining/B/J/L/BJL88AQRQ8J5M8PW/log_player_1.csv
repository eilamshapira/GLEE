"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but a 90/10 split isn't fair. I'm proposing a more balanced division that still gives you the larger share due to my inflation disadvantage. If we go another round, we'll both lose value due to further inflation. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
