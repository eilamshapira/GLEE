5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Let's each take $5000. Remember that with each round, inflation affects your value by 20%, so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try again. I'll take $5500, you get $4500. It's still a good deal for you given the inflation, so let's finalize this and take our money home!",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation affecting your gains by nearly 50% by now, I'm offering you $4500 while I take $5500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation factor. If we continue to later rounds, the inflation will reduce your value even more, so this is a reasonable deal to accept now.",Bob,4,
