Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Let's each take $5000. Remember that with each round, inflation affects your value by 20%, so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting your gains by nearly 50% by now, I'm offering you $4500 while I take $5500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation factor. If we continue to later rounds, the inflation will reduce your value even more, so this is a reasonable deal to accept now.

# Bob gain: 5500
