"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to start! I'll take $6000, you get $4000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $6000 while I get $4000, which isn't an equal split. Since inflation affects Alice's money value by 20% each round but doesn't affect mine (0% inflation for me), I have an advantage in waiting.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice will value the money 20% less, so I could potentially negotiate a better deal. However, we only have 12 rounds total.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Let's each take $5000. Remember that with each round, inflation affects your value by 20%, so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try again. I'll take $5500, you get $4500. It's still a good deal for you given the inflation, so let's finalize this and take our money home! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4500 while she takes $5500. 

Due to inflation, Alice's value of money has decreased by 36% since round 1, meaning any delay is more costly for her than for me. My money value doesn't change with rounds since my inflation rate is 0%.

While $4500 is better than her initial offer of $4000, I still have the advantage here. If we go to the next round, Alice's money will be worth 20% less again, which strengthens my negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation affecting your gains by nearly 50% by now, I'm offering you $4500 while I take $5500. This is actually favorable to you given the inflation factor. If we continue to later rounds, the inflation will reduce your value even more, so this is a reasonable deal to accept now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's make it even. I'll take $5000, you get $5000. Let's end this and walk away with something! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering an even split of $5000 each.

Due to inflation, Alice's value of money has decreased by 59.04% since round 1, which significantly impacts the actual value she receives. For me, the $5000 maintains its full value since my inflation rate is 0%.

Given that we're already in round 5, and Alice is now offering an equal split, this seems like a reasonable offer. If I reject, we'd go to round 6, where Alice's money would be worth even less to her, but we'd be spending more time negotiating and risking getting nothing if we reach all 12 rounds without agreement.

A 50-50 split is fair in nominal terms, and considering the inflation disadvantage Alice already faces, I'll accept this offer.
