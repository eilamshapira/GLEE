"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send my offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both an equal share, which I believe is a reasonable and equitable arrangement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering our positions.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I get $55 and Bob gets $45. Since Bob is affected by 20% inflation per round, I understand his incentive to reach an agreement. This offer gives him a significant portion while acknowledging that I'm not affected by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering our positions.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing we return to a 50-50 split. Bob is now facing almost 50% inflation on his end, making time more costly for him. This fair division gives us both a reasonable share, and considering the growing inflation pressure on Bob's side, I think this balanced proposal makes sense for both of us."
