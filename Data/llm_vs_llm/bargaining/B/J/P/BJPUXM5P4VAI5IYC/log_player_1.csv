"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that takes into account that Bob has a higher inflation penalty per round (10% vs my 5%). Since I'm making the first offer, I should make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk losing value in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This is a fair split considering Bob would lose more value than me if he rejects and moves to the next round. I get a bit more since I'm making the first move, but it's still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  - The money will be worth another 5% less for me
  - And 10% less for Bob
  - This would reduce our negotiating power further

Bob's offer is relatively fair, and waiting another round would reduce the total value significantly for both of us. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes it risky.
