"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer. Since we both need to agree and time pressure affects me through inflation, I'll propose a slightly favorable but not extreme split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

With this offer, I aim to get a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. If he declines, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me, so I have an incentive to make a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $500,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $450,000 to me
   * This is less than my initial offer but still a significant amount

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * But the money will be worth another 10% less to me (20% less total)
   * And Bob might make even lower offers knowing my time pressure

Given the inflation pressure and that this is a fair 50-50 split (even though it's worth less to me due to inflation), I think I should accept. The risk of getting worse offers as inflation increases is too high.
