"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is proposing that she gets 60% of the total amount ($600,000) while offering me 40% ($400,000). Since there's no inflation for me according to the rules, I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. With 11 rounds remaining after this one, I have room to negotiate for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that gives me a bit more than Alice's previous offer, but still remains fair.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally. A 50-50 split is fair to both of us, and I believe this is a reasonable compromise from your previous offer."
