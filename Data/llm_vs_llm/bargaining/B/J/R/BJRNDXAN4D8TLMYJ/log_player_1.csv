"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a division of the $10,000, keeping in mind the declining value for Bob over time. Since this is the first round, I'll aim for a generous offer to ensure acceptance and avoid losing value for both of us.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```

My reasoning is that even with a slightly higher share for me, Bob still gets a substantial amount. Since there's no value lost yet, this should be appealing to him."
