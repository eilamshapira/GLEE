"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money I would receive in this round versus potential future rounds, taking into account the 10% decrease in value for me with each round.

In Round 1, if I accept, I get $4900. 

If I reject, the money's value for me decreases by 10% in the next round. So, for Round 2, the total money would be worth 90% of $10,000 for me, which is $9000. However, I need to think about what I could potentially get in a future round that would be better than $4900 now, considering the decreasing value.

Given that Alice's offer gives her $5100 and me $4900, it seems somewhat fair, but I should consider if waiting could yield a better result. However, the risk of losing value and potentially getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds is significant.

For now, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer to ensure I get a substantial amount, considering the risk of the money decreasing in value for me over time.
