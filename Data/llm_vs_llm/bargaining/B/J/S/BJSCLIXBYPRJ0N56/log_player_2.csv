"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it, taking into account the inflation factor that affects my share.

In the first round, Alice offers me $4800, and herself $5200. If I reject this offer, the total amount will decrease by 5% for me in the next round, but I don't know how it affects Alice. However, since I'm trying to maximize my gain, I should consider the worst-case scenario for myself.

Given that the offer is not extremely biased against me and considering the risk of losing value due to inflation, I should evaluate if making a counteroffer could potentially yield a better result for me in subsequent rounds.

However, since this is the first round and the offer is somewhat reasonable, and considering I don't want to risk losing value due to inflation without knowing its effect on Alice, I might be inclined to accept to secure a known amount.

But, let's think strategically: If I reject, I get to make the next offer, potentially giving me more control over the division. Yet, the 5% decrease in value for me in each round is a significant factor to consider.

Given these considerations, my initial instinct might be to reject to try and negotiate a better deal, but the risk of inflation reducing my potential earnings in subsequent rounds is a significant deterrent.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I've rejected Alice's initial offer and considering the 5% decrease in value for me due to inflation, I need to make a strategic offer that takes into account the potential for further decreases in value if the game extends to more rounds.

Since the total value for me decreases by 5% each round, the $10,000 is now effectively worth $9,500 to me (because 10,000 * 0.95 = 9,500). However, for simplicity and to make calculations straightforward, I'll consider the original $10,000 as the base for my calculations, keeping in mind the inflation factor for my own valuation.

To make a compelling offer that considers the risk of further inflation and encourages Alice to accept, I should aim for a division that is reasonable but slightly favors me, given that I'm taking on the risk of making the offer and the uncertainty of Alice's inflation rate.

A 50/50 split would be $5,000 each, but considering I want to slightly favor myself while still being reasonable, I might consider offering Alice a bit less than half.

Let's propose a split where I get $5,200 and Alice gets $4,800. This offer is somewhat reciprocal to Alice's initial offer but adjusted to favor me slightly, considering I'm the one taking the risk of making the second offer.
