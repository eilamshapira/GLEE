"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my proposal to Bob and explain my reasoning.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Given that I face 10% inflation each round, delaying agreement hurts me. If we move to round 2, the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to me, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you mentioned inflation, I'm willing to offer you a slightly better deal than your last proposal. Let's go for a split that gives you a bit more than before, while still allowing me a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully, given the impact of inflation.

If I accept Bob's offer of $5,200, that amount is now worth only 90% of its original value to me due to the 10% inflation, which means it's effectively worth $4,680 to me.

If I reject and we move to round 3, any amount would be worth only 81% of the original value (another 10% decrease). Plus, Bob seems to be increasing his ask rather than making a more generous offer.
