"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Given that I face 10% inflation each round, delaying agreement hurts me. If we move to round 2, the $10000 will only be worth $9000 to me, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
