"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this slightly favorable split to me because Bob can either accept a good offer now or risk losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4050 to me
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but will face 20% inflation
3. Further rounds mean even more value loss due to inflation
4. This offer is fairly balanced considering the circumstances

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable enough and continuing would likely lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation effects."
