"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I must decide whether to accept Bob's offer, considering inflation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1.

Given Bob's offer:

*   Alice's Gain: 50 (This amount is not affected by inflation, just the value)
*   Bob's Gain: 50

To make a decision, I'll evaluate the value of the offer:

Since I will gain $50 and it's only round 2 and the value of the money for me is worth 5% less than in round 1, I'll convert the gain of Alice to the amount from round 1 to make a fair comparison.

```
50 / (1 - 0.05) = 52.63
```

I need to decide between 50$ and the potential offer from the next round. I don't know what Bob will offer in the next round, and I can assume Bob might be more greedy in the next round, as the value of the money is less for me. Therefore, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
