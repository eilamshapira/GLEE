"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty per round if I reject. If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value will be worth 10% less to me.

Since this is the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially since inflation hasn't affected the money yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but accounts for the inflation risk for both of us. Since we've already lost one round, I should propose a division that's attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than prolonging negotiations.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and accepting now means we avoid further devaluation due to inflation."
