"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally, 50-50. This seems like the fairest approach for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering an equal 50-50 split ($50 each)
- This is a perfectly fair and reasonable proposal
- I don't have a strong reason to reject and risk getting a worse deal
- Equal splits are common in these scenarios and generally considered fair
