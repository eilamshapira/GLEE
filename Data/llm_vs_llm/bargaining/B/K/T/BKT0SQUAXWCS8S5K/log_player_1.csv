Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further loss from devaluation we should agree now. Based on our mutual discount factor of 0.9, I propose taking $52.63 while you receive $47.37. This division mirrors the equilibrium split if we were to continue bargainingâ€”please accept before the pie shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
