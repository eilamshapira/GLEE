"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will be worth 20% less (8000$ total)
4. My 4000$ is still better than 40% of 8000$ (3200$)

While the offer isn't entirely fair (40/60 split), rejecting it would mean dealing with a smaller total amount, which could lead to both of us getting less money. It's a reasonable first offer.
