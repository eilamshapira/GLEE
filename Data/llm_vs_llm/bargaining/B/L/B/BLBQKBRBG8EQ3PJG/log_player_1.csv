"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fairly generous offer to Bob to encourage acceptance and avoid value loss through inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split giving myself $550,000 (55%) and Bob $450,000 (45%). It's a reasonable first offer that respects both parties while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. Due to 5% inflation, the real value is now:
   * Alice: $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000
   * Bob: $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000
3. If I reject, we'll lose another 5% in the next round
4. This is a reasonable offer given the inflation penalty
