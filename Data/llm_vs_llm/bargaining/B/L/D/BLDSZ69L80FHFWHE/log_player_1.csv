"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send my offer to Bob. I should consider the inflation rates -- if we delay, the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round. It might be strategic to offer a fair division that Bob would accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair split that gives us both equal shares. Accepting this now would be better for both of us than continuing to later rounds where inflation reduces the value."
