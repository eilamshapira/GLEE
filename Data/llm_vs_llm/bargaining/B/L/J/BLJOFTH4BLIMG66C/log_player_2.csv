"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer to start with! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $40 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice
   * Maximum I could get next round would be worth $80 × 0.8 = $64 for me
   * But Alice would need to accept, and for her it would be worth $20 × 0.9 = $18

A 60/40 split isn't great, but considering the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiation, it might be better to accept now rather than risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
