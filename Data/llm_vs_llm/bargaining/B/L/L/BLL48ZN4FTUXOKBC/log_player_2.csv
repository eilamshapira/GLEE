"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 45-55 split. Since your money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), this is a good deal for you. Let's avoid losing value through negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer. She's offering me 45% ($450,000) while taking 55% ($550,000).

Given that my money devalues at 10% per round while hers devalues at 5%, there's an incentive to make a deal sooner rather than later. If I reject and move to round 2, my $450,000 would be worth only $405,000 (10% less), while her $550,000 would be worth $522,500 (5% less).

While I could counter with a more favorable split in round 2, the devaluation means we're collectively losing money with each round. A 45-55 split in round 1 is better than a 50-50 split in round 2 would be for me.

This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates, so I'll accept.
