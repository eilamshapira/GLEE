"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40, which is less than half of the total amount. Since this is just the first round and inflation isn't affecting me, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. There's no rush to accept an uneven split when I have more opportunities to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer. I'll aim for a reasonable proposal that Alice might accept to avoid prolonging the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting situation. Alice is offering me $45, which is better than her first offer of $40. Furthermore, I now know that inflation is affecting Alice's gains significantly (36% less value for her), while my value remains the same. This means her $55 is actually worth less to her now.

Given that:
1. The offer to me ($45) is reasonable
2. Alice is facing significant inflation pressure
3. We've already gone through 3 rounds
4. I'm getting real value while Alice's value is diminishing
