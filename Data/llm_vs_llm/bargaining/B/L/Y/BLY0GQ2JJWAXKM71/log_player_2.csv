"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $45 out of $100
- It's the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
- I have the option to counter-offer in the next round
- The split is relatively fair (45-55)
- There's always a risk Alice might offer less in future rounds

While I could try to negotiate for a more even 50-50 split, $45 is a reasonable offer that's close to fair. Taking it now guarantees a good outcome without risking worse offers or reaching the 12-round limit.
