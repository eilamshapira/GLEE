"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":80,""bob_gain"":20,""message"":""Hey Bob, let's split the money fairly. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. It's a good start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair here - a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. Remember, with 5% inflation per round, we both lose by dragging this out. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
