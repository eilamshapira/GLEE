"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's split the money fairly. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. It's a good start! 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","That's quite an unfair offer from Alice! Taking 80% and leaving me with just 20% is far from a fair split. Given that we have multiple rounds available and considering the 5% inflation per round, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable offer, suggesting a fair split while mentioning the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement soon due to inflation.

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair here - a 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. Remember, with 5% inflation per round, we both lose by dragging this out. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""
