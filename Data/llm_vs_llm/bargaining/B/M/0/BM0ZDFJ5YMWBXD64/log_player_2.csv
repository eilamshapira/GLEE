"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me since inflation affects you more (20% per round vs my 10%). If we delay, we both lose value - you especially. This offer gives you $45 now, which is better than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
