"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split $100 evenly at this first round. Given the inflation hit on my side with each round that passes, itâ€™s in both our best interests to settle quickly on a fair, 50/50 division. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you mentioned inflation affects your side, I understand you want to settle quickly. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Given that every extra round further depreciates my share by 20%, I appreciate settling early. I accept the 60/40 split in your favor.""}"
