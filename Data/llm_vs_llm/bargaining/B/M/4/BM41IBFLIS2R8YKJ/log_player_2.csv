"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split $100 evenly at this first round. Given the inflation hit on my side with each round that passes, itâ€™s in both our best interests to settle quickly on a fair, 50/50 division. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering a 50/50 split ($50 each)
2. She mentions inflation affects her, but I know inflation is 0% for me
3. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I could potentially get a better deal in later rounds
4. However, there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. 50/50 is a fair starting offer, but I might be able to negotiate for more

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer while remaining reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you mentioned inflation affects your side, I understand you want to settle quickly. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.""}"
