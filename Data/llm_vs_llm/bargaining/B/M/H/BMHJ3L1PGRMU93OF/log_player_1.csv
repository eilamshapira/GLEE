"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us in each round. My goal is to secure a good portion for myself before the money becomes worthless.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm taking a larger share initially (65%) because my perception of the money's value is decreasing faster than Bob's (20% vs. 10%).
*   I believe this offer is reasonable enough for Bob to accept, as he still gets a substantial $350,000.
*   This approach balances my desire for a large initial gain with the risk of rejection and further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and now he's proposing to give me $600,000 and keep $400,000 for himself.

Before making a decision, I need to consider the inflation. For me, the value of the money is 20% less than in round 1. For Bob, it is 10% less.

**My calculation:**

*   **My gain:** $600,000
*   **Inflation adjusted value for me:** $600,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $480,000

Even with the inflation, $480,000 is a decent amount. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Although Bob is still getting a higher amount, it's not unreasonable for him to want more after rejecting my initial offer.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
