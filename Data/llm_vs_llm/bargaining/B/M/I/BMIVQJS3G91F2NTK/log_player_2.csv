"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that any further delay will cost me 5% due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's fair and gives both of us a substantial portion. If Alice rejects this, we'll move to round 3 where my potential gains would be reduced by 5% due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
