"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while taking $6,000 for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value of the money by 10%. 

If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. If I could secure more than $4,000 of that $9,000, it might be worth rejecting. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'll make my decision based on what I know about my situation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-proposal that's fair but also accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

Given that the $10,000 is now worth 10% less to me (effectively $9,000), I need to secure a reasonable portion that considers both my interests and is attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I believe is fair for both of us. While I know the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, a 50-50 division is equitable and should be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation factors for both of us.

The $10,000 has depreciated differently for each of us:
- For me, the money is worth 19% less than in round 1
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less than in round 1

Alice is now offering me $4,500, which after my 19% inflation is worth about $3,645 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 4, the inflation will increase further. Given that Alice has already improved her offer from $4,000 to $4,500, and considering that she's facing even higher inflation than I am, this seems like a reasonable compromise.

With the increasing inflation penalty for both of us, continuing to negotiate would likely result in diminishing returns.
