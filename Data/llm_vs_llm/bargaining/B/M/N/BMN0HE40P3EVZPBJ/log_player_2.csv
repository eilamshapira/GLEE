"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself.

If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the total money will be worth less - 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice. That means in round 2, the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me and only $800,000 to Alice.

Given the significant inflation penalty for Alice (20% per round), I have more negotiating power in later rounds. Alice should be more motivated to reach an agreement sooner.

I'll reject this first offer to make a counter-proposal that's more favorable to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'm proposing a split that gives me the majority but still leaves Alice with a substantial amount. If she rejects, the total value decreases significantly more for her than for me in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. Due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth about 9.75% less than the original value, making it worth approximately $406,125 in original value terms.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another counter-offer. However, inflation will continue to reduce the value - about 15% total reduction for me and 50% for Alice compared to the original amount.

Given that Alice's inflation rate is much higher (20% per round vs my 5%), and she's already moved significantly from her initial position, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
