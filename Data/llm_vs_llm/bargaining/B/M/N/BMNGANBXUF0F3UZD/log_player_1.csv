"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

Since inflation affects Bob more than me (his money loses 10% value each round while mine keeps its value), I should consider offering a reasonable split that Bob would be likely to accept now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
