"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on the rules you described, one can analyze the game by “back‐solving” from the final round. (Note: This explanation sketches one way to arrive at an equilibrium proposal; there are many details involved in a full game‐theoretic treatment.) 

Here’s a simplified outline of the reasoning:

• In round 12 the proposer (Bob, since turns alternate) can keep almost everything because if the offer were rejected the game ends with nothing. In that final round Bob would offer Alice essentially nothing (an arbitrarily small amount) so that her utility of accepting (essentially 0) is at least as good as the alternative.

• In round 11 Alice would be the proposer. Knowing that if Bob rejects he would become the proposer in round 12 and secure nearly 100 dollars (nominal) – though that money is “discounted” by 10% per round (so his round‐12 utility is 100×0.90^(11)) – Alice must offer him at least the equivalent (when converting utilities between rounds). In effect, she must “leave him enough” in round 11 (when Bob’s money is worth 0.90^(10) per dollar) so his payoff is no less than waiting for round 12.

• Working backward in this fashion—adjusting each player’s “cost of waiting” using the 5% discount for Alice and 10% discount for Bob—we eventually reach round 1. In round 1 you (Alice) are the proposer. To secure Bob’s acceptance, you must offer him at least what he could obtain if he were to switch roles in round 2. (In our analysis the required offer for Bob turns out to be about 57.98 dollars nominally.) 

Thus, to have Bob accept in round 1 rather than waiting for a later round when his money is “worth less,” you would make an offer that gives you about 42.02 dollars and him about 57.98 dollars. (Note that these amounts are derived by “backward induction” with the proper discount‐factor adjustments in each round. Small rounding differences may occur, but this is roughly the equilibrium split.)

Accordingly, my offer for round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 42.02, ""bob_gain"": 57.98}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on the structure of the game, we can “back‐solve” from later rounds to determine what Bob would expect to get if he were to turn things around. (Keep in mind that here the “discount factors” for a one–round delay are 0.95 for you and 0.90 for Bob, a ratio that will remain the same each time you wait one round.) 

Here’s one way to roughly outline the reasoning for round 3:

1. In round 3, you (Alice) get to propose a division of the 100 dollars. However, because two rounds have already passed the “full–value” stage, the nominal dollars now are “worth less.” In particular, your money is now worth 0.95² ≈ 0.9025 per nominal dollar and Bob’s is worth 0.90² = 0.81 per nominal dollar relative to round 1.

2. If Bob rejects your round 3 offer, he becomes the proposer in round 4. In that stage the effective one–round discount factors remain (0.95 for you and 0.90 for Bob) because moving from round 3 to round 4 they lose an extra 5% and 10% respectively. (That is, going from round 3 to round 4 the factors change by 0.95 and 0.90.) 

3. In the subgame starting at round 4 (with roles switched), the standard alternating–offers calculation (assuming the proposer offers the smallest amount that makes the opponent indifferent) gives the following “one–step” split. When Bob is proposer, he can secure a share given by
  (1 – δ_A)⁄(1 – δ_A·δ_B)
with δ_A = 0.95 (your one–round discount) and δ_B = 0.90 (Bob’s one–round discount). Numerically this is:
  (1 – 0.95)⁄(1 – (0.95×0.90)) = 0.05⁄(1 – 0.855) = 0.05⁄0.145 ≈ 0.3448.
That is, as proposer in round 4 Bob would secure about 34.48% of the nominal 100 dollars while offering you about 65.52%.

4. But note that in round 4 the players’ dollars are even less valuable. In round 4 Bob’s dollars are multiplied by 0.9³ (≈0.729) and yours by 0.95³ (≈0.8574). Thus, Bob’s resulting utility if he waits—that is, if he becomes proposer—would be about:
  Bob’s utility in round 4 = 0.729 × (34.48) ≈ 25.15 (in “round–3 terms” Bob’s discounted utility).

5. Now, returning to round 3 (where Bob’s dollars are currently worth 0.81 per nominal dollar), you must offer Bob at least enough nominal dollars so that his immediate utility is at least 25.15. In other words, if you offer Bob “x” nominal dollars in round 3 then his utility is 0.81×x. Setting
  0.81 × x = 25.15  ⇒  x ≈ 25.15/0.81 ≈ 31.06.
That means Bob will be indifferent if he gets roughly 31.06 nominal dollars in round 3. Offering him slightly more would give him a reason to accept immediately, and offering him less would make him prefer waiting.

6. Since the total is 100 dollars, you would keep 100 – 31.06 ≈ 68.94 nominal dollars.

Thus, a reasonable equilibrium offer for round 3 is to propose that you (Alice) get about 68.94 dollars and Bob gets about 31.06 dollars. (There will naturally be rounding issues in any equilibrium analysis of such a finitely repeated bargaining game with different discount factors, but these numbers capture the idea that because Bob’s money is “eroding” faster his continuation value is lower, and you can claim a larger share.)
