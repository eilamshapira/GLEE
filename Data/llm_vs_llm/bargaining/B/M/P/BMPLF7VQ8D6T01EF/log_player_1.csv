Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation on your side, Alice. Let's adjust the split to 55/45 in your favor. This way, we both get a fair share, and you receive a bit more to compensate. Let's aim to reach an agreement soon! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
