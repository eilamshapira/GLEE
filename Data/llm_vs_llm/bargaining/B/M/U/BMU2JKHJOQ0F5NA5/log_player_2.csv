"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me for proposing first. This way, we both get a good deal before inflation affects the value too much. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. If I reject and wait for next round:
   * The total value will decrease by 10% for me
   * My maximum potential gain in next round would be from $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
   * Alice would need to accept my next proposal

Alice's offer is quite reasonable considering:
- It's a fair split with a small first-mover premium
- Waiting would immediately cost me 10% due to inflation
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in the next round
