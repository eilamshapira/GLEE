Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. This is better than waiting several rounds where we both lose value due to inflation. Your 450k now is worth more than a higher amount later because of the 5% inflation per round for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates (20% for you vs 5% for me), waiting isn't in your best interest. $400k now is worth more to you than $500k in two rounds. This is a fair offer given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

With my higher inflation rate of 20%, delays hurt me more than you. Your $500k now is worth more than waiting for a potentially higher amount later, since each round costs you 5% in value. Let's end this with a fair split that benefits us both.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical about the inflation rates. Your money has already lost 36% of value and will lose 56% if we continue. My share has only lost 9.75%. This split gives you $350k now, which is worth more than $500k would be in two more rounds due to your 20% per-round inflation. This is your best option given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 350000

At our current inflation rates, waiting is hurting both of us, but especially me. With my 20% inflation rate, I've already lost significant value. Your inflation is only 5% per round, but why continue losing value? This is a fair offer considering our positions, and I hope we can agree and end this now.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider our positions carefully. Your money has lost nearly 60% of its value, while mine has only lost 18.55%. If we go another round, you'll lose almost 80% of value. This $300k now is worth more to you than $470k from your last offer would be worth in two more rounds. Given our inflation rates, this is actually a fair split that reflects our economic positions. Let's end this now before we both lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

This is my final offer considering our inflation rates. At this point, I've already lost 73.8% of my value while you've only lost 26.5%. If we continue, I'll lose over 90% in a few more rounds. This offer gives you the majority while still leaving me with something reasonable. Let's end this now and both walk away with value rather than continuing this decline.""}"
