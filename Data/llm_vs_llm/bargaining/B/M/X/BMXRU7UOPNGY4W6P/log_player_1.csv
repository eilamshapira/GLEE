"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45. This is a balanced first offer that acknowledges both our positions and the risk of inflation."
