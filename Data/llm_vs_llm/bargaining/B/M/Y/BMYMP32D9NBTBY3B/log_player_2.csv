"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the amount equally to ensure we both benefit fairly from the full amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's proposal carefully.

Alice is offering an equal split of the $10,000, with $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair and reasonable first offer that gives us both equal amounts without any advantage to either side.

If I reject this offer, I would get to make a counter-proposal in round 2, but the total amount would decrease by 10% to $9,000 due to inflation. Even if I tried to get a larger share in the next round, the total pie would be smaller.

Since Alice has offered an even 50-50 split of the full amount, which is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
