8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 as $8333 for me and $1667 for you. Given that with each subsequent round the money will be discounted—5% for me and 20% for you—this division reflects our respective time‐preferences. Accepting now guarantees both of us a better value than risking further erosion in future rounds. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I propose a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer. Let's end this now.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s proposal gives me a nominal $5000 in round 2, which is worth 0.95×$5000 = $4750 in today’s terms. However, by rejecting I secure the right to propose in round 3, where my discount is only 5% per round—far less than Bob’s 20% decline—and thus I have strong bargaining power. In round 3, I can structure an offer that gives me a much higher effective payoff while barely satisfying Bob’s minimal requirements (since his alternative will be even more diluted by the 20% discount in subsequent rounds). Given that my expected payoff in round 3 is significantly higher than the effective $4750 on the table now, I must reject Bob’s 50/50 split offer.",Alice,2,reject
3333.0,6667.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal. By waiting till now, my share is discounted by only 10% while yours is at 40% relative to the first round. In round 3 the effective values are 0.9×(nominal share for me) and 0.6×(nominal share for you). If you reject and wait until round 4 when you propose, even if you take nearly all of the $10000, you would only secure about 0.4×$10000 = $4000 in today’s terms. To make you indifferent between accepting now and moving to round 4, my offer gives you a nominal $6667 (whose effective value is roughly 0.6×6667 = $4000) while I keep $3333 for myself (effective value 0.9×3333 ≈ $3000). This bargain reflects our relative time‐preferences and avoids further loss from inflation. I believe it’s in both our best interests to settle on these terms now. What do you say?",Alice,3,
