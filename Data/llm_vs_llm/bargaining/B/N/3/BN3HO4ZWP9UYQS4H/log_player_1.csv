"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 as $8,333 for me and $1,667 for you. Given that with each subsequent round the money will be discounted—5% for me and 20% for you—this division reflects our respective time‐preferences. Accepting now guarantees both of us a better value than risking further erosion in future rounds. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s proposal gives me a nominal $5000 in round 2, which is worth 0.95×$5000 = $4750 in today’s terms. However, by rejecting I secure the right to propose in round 3, where my discount is only 5% per round—far less than Bob’s 20% decline—and thus I have strong bargaining power. In round 3, I can structure an offer that gives me a much higher effective payoff while barely satisfying Bob’s minimal requirements (since his alternative will be even more diluted by the 20% discount in subsequent rounds). Given that my expected payoff in round 3 is significantly higher than the effective $4750 on the table now, I must reject Bob’s 50/50 split offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3333, ""bob_gain"": 6667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal. By waiting till now, my share is discounted by only 10% while yours is at 40% relative to the first round. In round 3 the effective values are 0.9×(nominal share for me) and 0.6×(nominal share for you). If you reject and wait until round 4 when you propose, even if you take nearly all of the $10,000, you would only secure about 0.4×$10,000 = $4,000 in today’s terms. To make you indifferent between accepting now and moving to round 4, my offer gives you a nominal $6,667 (whose effective value is roughly 0.6×6,667 = $4,000) while I keep $3,333 for myself (effective value 0.9×3,333 ≈ $3,000). This bargain reflects our relative time‐preferences and avoids further loss from inflation. I believe it’s in both our best interests to settle on these terms now. What do you say?""}"
