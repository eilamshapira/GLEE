Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 as $8333 for me and $1667 for you. Given that with each subsequent round the money will be discounted—5% for me and 20% for you—this division reflects our respective time‐preferences. Accepting now guarantees both of us a better value than risking further erosion in future rounds. Looking forward to your response.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal. By waiting till now, my share is discounted by only 10% while yours is at 40% relative to the first round. In round 3 the effective values are 0.9×(nominal share for me) and 0.6×(nominal share for you). If you reject and wait until round 4 when you propose, even if you take nearly all of the $10000, you would only secure about 0.4×$10000 = $4000 in today’s terms. To make you indifferent between accepting now and moving to round 4, my offer gives you a nominal $6667 (whose effective value is roughly 0.6×6667 = $4000) while I keep $3333 for myself (effective value 0.9×3333 ≈ $3000). This bargain reflects our relative time‐preferences and avoids further loss from inflation. I believe it’s in both our best interests to settle on these terms now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333
