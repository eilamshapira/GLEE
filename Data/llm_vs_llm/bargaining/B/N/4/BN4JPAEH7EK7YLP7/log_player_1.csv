Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of $500000 each. This way, we both walk away with a fair share and minimize the impact of inflation. Let's agree on this balanced offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
