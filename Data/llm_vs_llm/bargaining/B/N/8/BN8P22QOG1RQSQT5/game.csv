4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges the different inflation rates while giving us both a substantial amount. This is better for you than losing another 20% in value by continuing to negotiate.",Bob,2,
