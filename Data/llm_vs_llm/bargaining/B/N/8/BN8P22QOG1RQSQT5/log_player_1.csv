"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges the different inflation rates while giving us both a substantial amount. This is better for you than losing another 20% in value by continuing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $3600
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth 40% less for me
- Bob's offer does consider the inflation dynamics
- Going to round 3 would significantly reduce the real value for both of us
