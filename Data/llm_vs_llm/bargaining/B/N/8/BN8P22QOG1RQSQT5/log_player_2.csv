"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Alice's 60-40 split in her favor is reasonable, or if I should reject and make a counter-offer next round.

If I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. This means in the next round:
- The $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me
- The $10,000 would be worth $8,000 to Alice

Since Alice's utility decreases faster than mine, I have some leverage in negotiation. However, I need to weigh that against the absolute loss I'd take by waiting.

Alice's current offer gives me $4,000, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject my offer too, leading to further depreciation.

Given these considerations, I'll reject the offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the fact that inflation affects Alice more severely, while still improving my position from her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. Since inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges the different inflation rates while giving us both a substantial amount. This is better for you than losing another 20% in value by continuing to negotiate.""}"
