"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you lose value faster than me (20% vs 5% per round), so it's in your interest to accept early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 5% less
   * But I'll get to make the next offer

If I reject, any amount I get in the next round will be worth 20% less. So to match the current $400,000 offer, I'd need to get $500,000 in the next round just to break even.

Given that:
- The difference in depreciation rates is significant (20% vs 5%)
- I get a substantial portion ($400,000)
- The risk of prolonged negotiation could lead to much worse outcomes
- Alice's reasoning about the depreciation rates is valid

While I might be able to negotiate for a bit more, the risk of losing value through delay isn't worth it.
