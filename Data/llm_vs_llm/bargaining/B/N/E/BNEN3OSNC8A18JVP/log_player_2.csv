"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my decision carefully. Alice is offering an equal split of the money. This seems fair at first, but I have to factor in the inflation rates:

- For me, the value decreases by 20% each round
- For Alice, the value decreases by 10% each round

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the $10,000 will be worth less to both of us. My inflation rate is higher, so delaying is more costly for me than for Alice.

Let me evaluate: $5,000 now is better than potentially getting a bit more later but with 20% less value. A fair split considering our different inflation rates might favor me slightly more, but the risk of continued negotiation significantly reducing the money's value makes this a reasonable offer.
