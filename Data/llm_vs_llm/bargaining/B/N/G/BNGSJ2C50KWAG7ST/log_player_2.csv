"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, the total amount will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the 1,000,000 would effectively be worth 800,000 to me. 

Currently, Alice is offering me a 50/50 split, so I'd get 500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'd need to secure more than 62.5% of the new total (500,000/800,000) just to break even with what I'm being offered now.

Given the inflation penalty and the fair nature of this first offer, accepting is the rational choice.
