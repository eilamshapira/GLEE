Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think 60-40 is a bit biased. How about we do a 55-45 split? This way, we both get a decent share, and I get a bit more since I'm making a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is a fair counter-offer from Bob. While I get slightly less than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split, and accepting now is better than risking further depreciation of the money through inflation. The 10% inflation penalty means that delaying would reduce the real value of any future agreement, so it's smart to accept this fair offer early in the game."
