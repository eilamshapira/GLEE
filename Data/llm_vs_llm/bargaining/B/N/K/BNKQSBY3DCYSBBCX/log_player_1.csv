"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking the initiative. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you're asking for more in your first offer, I'm offering you a bit more while also securing a fair amount for myself. Let's reach an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $600,000, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $570,000 to me
2. This is better than what I offered in the first round ($550,000)
3. If I reject and we continue, further inflation will reduce the value
4. Bob is being reasonable and actually offering me more than I initially proposed
5. It's only round 2, but getting a good deal early is better than risking further value loss
