"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob will find acceptable, keeping in mind the declining value of the money for me with each round. I'll start with a slightly more generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is playing a fair game. Accepting this offer now would give me $500,000, but that's worth 10% less than it would have been in round 1. That means it's effectively worth $450,000 in round 1 dollars. My previous offer aimed for $550,000, but perhaps I was too greedy. I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
