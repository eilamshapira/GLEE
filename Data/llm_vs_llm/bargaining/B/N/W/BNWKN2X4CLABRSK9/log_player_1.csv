"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1. I'm trying to be fair but also account for the potential for inflation affecting me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think about this carefully, considering the inflation.

My gain would be 50, but it's worth 20% less, so it's effectively 50 * 0.8 = 40.

Bob's gain is 50, and it's worth 5% less, so it's effectively 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

Even though it's an even split nominally, Bob is getting slightly more in real value due to the different inflation rates. However, I'm also aware that rejecting means further inflation, which will hurt me even more.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.
