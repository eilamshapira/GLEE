"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is now worth significantly less to me. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and we are at round 4, the total inflation I have experienced is roughly 30% (1 - 0.9^3 = ~0.271, so about 27%).  However, to simplify the math, and also considering the fact that the value of the money for me is decreasing I will propose to get at least half of the amount.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is now worth even less to me. With inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to be more aggressive. I will still try to get at least half, but I will consider a slightly lower offer to prevent further losses due to inflation.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is now worth even less to me, and the situation is getting desperate. I need to secure a reasonable amount before inflation wipes out everything. I will lower my demands in an attempt to finalize the division.
