"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6926.12 
# Alice gain: 3073.88 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $6,926.12 (about 69% of the total)
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - Money is worth 10% less to me
   - Money is worth 20% less to Alice
   - I get to make the next offer

The current offer is quite favorable for me, giving me nearly 70% of the total. If I reject, any future gains would be worth less due to inflation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer due to her higher inflation penalty.

Given that this is a good first offer and avoiding inflation is important, I'll accept.
