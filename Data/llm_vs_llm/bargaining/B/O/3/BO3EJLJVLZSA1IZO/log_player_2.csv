"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she takes $60. If I reject, we'll move to another round where I can make a counter-proposal, but the total value will decrease by 10% to $90.

Let me think about this strategically. I could reject and propose a more favorable split next round, but we'd be dividing $90 instead of $100. If I want more than $40, I'd need to propose taking more than 44.4% of the remaining $90.

While not perfectly equal, $40 is a reasonable offer that avoids the risk of further devaluation.
