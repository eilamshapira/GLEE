"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be fair and accepted:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, hoping Bob will accept to avoid future inflation. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and the sooner we agree, the better, considering the inflation."
