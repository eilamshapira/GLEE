"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the 20% inflation for me, the $45 offered now is worth less than it was in the first round. Let's calculate the adjusted value:

*   My gain in Round 1: 60$
*   Inflation for me: 20%
*   So, 45$ in Round 2 is equivalent to 45$ / 1.20 = 37.5$ in round 1

Since I offered Bob 40 in round 1. It would be better to reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, considering the ongoing inflation (20% for me, 10% for Bob).  I'll try to be a bit more fair this time since I rejected Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
