"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 5% value loss per round if rejected. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects it, the next round will be worth less to me due to the 5% inflation penalty, while Bob faces no such penalty. This gives Bob some incentive to accept now rather than counter with his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The $45 offered to me is now worth $42.75 (95% of $45) due to 5% inflation
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth only 90% of the original value
3. If we keep going back and forth, my value keeps decreasing while Bob's stays the same
4. $42.75 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to increasing inflation penalties
