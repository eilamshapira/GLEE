"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair. We both need to agree, and this allows for a better distribution of the money. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 5% less to me now, so $4,500 is actually worth $4,275 to me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects our situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation affecting me, I need a higher nominal amount to compensate for the 5% loss each round. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and helps us both avoid further devaluation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
