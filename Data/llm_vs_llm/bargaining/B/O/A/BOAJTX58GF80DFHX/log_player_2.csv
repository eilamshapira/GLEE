Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation affecting me, I need a higher nominal amount to compensate for the 5% loss each round. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and helps us both avoid further devaluation. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
