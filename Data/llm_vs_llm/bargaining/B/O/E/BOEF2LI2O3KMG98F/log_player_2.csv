"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair start, and we can negotiate further if necessary. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice's offer gives me only 20% of the total amount ($2000), which is quite low. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth:
- For me: 95% of original value
- For Alice: 80% of original value

This significant difference in inflation rates (5% vs 20%) works in my favor. Alice has more to lose by delaying, so I should have better bargaining power in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice has a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), and she's now facing a significant devaluation of her potential gains, I'll propose a more balanced split but still giving me an advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that delays affect your gains more significantly (20% vs 5% inflation), this is a fair offer that gives you $4000 now rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds.""}"
