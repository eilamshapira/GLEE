"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing:
- I (Bob) get $4,000
- She gets $6,000

Given the inflation rates:
- My money loses 5% value per round
- Alice's money loses 20% value per round

If I reject and we go to round 2, I'd need to make a better offer for myself, but Alice would be more likely to reject since her money would be worth less (she faces higher inflation). 

This is a reasonable first offer where I get 40% of the total. While I could try to negotiate for more, the asymmetric inflation rates favor making a deal sooner rather than later.
