Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think $55 for me and $45 for you is a fair deal this round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Let's see if Bob gets more desperate in the next round. His offer is getting better, but I think I can still get more out of this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, last offer. I take $65, you get $35. It's declining fast, so take it while you can!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation hitting us hard, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. It's a fair split considering the value loss. Let's end this before it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best I can realistically hope for at this point. The longer the game goes on, the less the money will be worth.  Bob won't offer me more than this."
