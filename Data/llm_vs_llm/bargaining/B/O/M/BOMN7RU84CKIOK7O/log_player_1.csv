"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains and the different inflation rates affect us differently. Since I (Alice) lose value faster at 20% per round compared to Bob's 10%, I should aim for a quick agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives both parties a significant portion
2. It acknowledges that I need to make an attractive enough offer to avoid multiple rounds where I'll lose more value
3. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk losing value through inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this 50-50 split now:
   * My $50 is worth 20% less, so effectively I get $40
   * Bob's $50 is worth 10% less, so he effectively gets $45

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my money will be worth another 20% less (total 40% less than original)
   * And Bob's will be worth another 10% less
   * The declining value makes future rounds less attractive

3. This is actually not a terrible offer considering:
   * It's a fair nominal split
   * While I get less real value than Bob due to different inflation rates, waiting will only make this worse
   * The risk of further negotiations could lead to even worse outcomes

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because getting $40 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
