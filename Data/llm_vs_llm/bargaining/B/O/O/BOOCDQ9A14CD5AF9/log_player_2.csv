"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice is offering me 2000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer
3. However, for me the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. Current offer: 2000$
5. Same amount next round: 1600$ (due to 20% inflation)

The offer is quite low (only 20% of the total), and since this is the first round, I can afford to reject and make a counter-offer. Even with the 20% inflation penalty, I can propose a better split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a more balanced offer. Considering that:
1. Alice faces only 5% inflation per round while I face 20%
2. We need to reach an agreement soon due to my higher inflation rate
3. A fair proposal might be more likely to be accepted

I'll propose a more equitable split, but still favoring me since it's early in the game:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This represents a 60-40 split in my favor, which is much better than the 20-80 split Alice proposed, while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it."
