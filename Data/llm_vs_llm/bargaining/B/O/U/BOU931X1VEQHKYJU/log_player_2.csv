"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $40 and she gets $60.

The inflation information is important here:
- For me (Bob), money maintains its value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money loses 20% value each round

Since Alice faces significant inflation and I don't, I have an advantage in later rounds. If I reject now, Alice's next offer will need to be more generous to me since her share will be worth less to her in the next round.

Given these dynamics, I should reject this initial offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round when I make the proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 2, I'll consider the inflation dynamics carefully.

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less this round compared to round 1. This means she should be more willing to accept a smaller share now rather than wait for future rounds where her money would be worth even less.

I'll propose a division that's more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer, while still being reasonable enough that she should accept rather than move to round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Alice receives $40. This is reasonable given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round, and waiting would make any future amount worth significantly less to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $45 and she would get $55.

Important inflation update:
- For me (Bob), money still maintains its value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money is now worth 36% less than in round 1

Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45, but I still have a strong advantage due to the inflation asymmetry. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where:
1. I'll make the next offer
2. Alice's money will be worth even less (likely around 49% less than round 1)

Given that Alice's money continues to lose significant value each round while mine doesn't, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 4, I'll consider the inflation dynamics carefully.

For Alice, the money is now significantly devalued - it's worth about 49% less than in round 1. This means each passing round makes any future amount increasingly less valuable to her, while my value remains constant.

Given this strong negotiating position, I'll propose a more favorable division for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than risk further devaluation in round 5.

{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I receive $70 and Alice receives $30. This is reasonable considering that Alice faces severe inflation per round (now around 49% less value than round 1), and waiting would make any future amount worth even less to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $48 and she would get $52.

Important inflation update:
- For me (Bob), money still maintains its full value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money is now worth 59.04% less than in round 1

Alice has increased her offer to me from $45 to $48, which shows she's feeling pressure from the inflation. However, I still have a very strong advantage due to the inflation asymmetry. 

If I reject, we'll go to round 6 where:
1. I'll make the next offer
2. Alice's money will be worth even less (approximately 67% less than round 1)

Given that Alice's money continues to rapidly lose value while mine doesn't, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 6, I need to consider that Alice's money has lost significant value - approximately 67% less than in round 1. Meanwhile, my money maintains its full value.

This gives me substantial negotiating leverage. Alice faces a difficult choice: accept my offer now or risk her share becoming worth even less in future rounds. Each rejection is increasingly costly for her, but not for me.

Given this strong position, I'll propose a division that's heavily in my favor, but still offers Alice enough that she should rationally accept rather than face further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 80, 
""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I receive $80 and Alice receives $20. This offer reflects the reality that Alice faces severe inflation (now approximately 67% less value than round 1), and waiting would make any future amount worth substantially less to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $50 and she would get $50.

Important inflation update:
- For me (Bob), money still maintains its full value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money is now worth 73.79% less than in round 1

Alice has increased her offer to me from $48 to $50, making it an even split. However, this doesn't properly account for the severe inflation asymmetry. Her $50 is effectively worth only about $13.10 compared to round 1 value, while my $50 maintains full value.

If I reject, we'll go to round 8 where:
1. I'll make the next offer
2. Alice's money will be worth even less (approximately 79% less than round 1)

Given the extreme inflation pressure on Alice and that we're in round 7 of 12, I should continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 8, I need to consider that Alice's money has lost extreme value - approximately 79% less than in round 1. Meanwhile, my money maintains its full value.

This gives me overwhelming negotiating leverage. Alice faces severe inflation pressure, with each passing round making her share worth substantially less. We're now in round 8 of 12, so we're getting closer to the deadline.

Given this strong position and the fact that Alice has rejected my previous offers despite her worsening position, I'll make an offer that's very favorable to me but still rational for Alice to accept given her circumstances.

{""bob_gain"": 85, 
""alice_gain"": 15}

I'm proposing that I receive $85 and Alice receives $15. This offer reflects the reality that Alice faces extreme inflation (approximately 79% less value than round 1), and waiting would make any future amount worth even less to her. At this point, even a small amount now is better for Alice than potentially more in future rounds due to the severe devaluation she faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this updated offer:

Alice is now offering me (Bob) $52 and she would get $48.

Important inflation update:
- For me (Bob), money still maintains its full value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, money is now worth 83.22% less than in round 1

Alice has only marginally increased her offer to me from $50 to $52, which doesn't reflect the extreme inflation asymmetry. Her $48 is effectively worth only about $8.05 compared to round 1 value, while my $52 maintains full value.

If I reject, we'll go to round 10 where:
1. I'll make the next offer
2. Alice's money will be worth even less (approximately 86.6% less than round 1)

Given the severe inflation pressure on Alice and that we're in round 9 of 12, I should continue negotiating for a better deal. However, I need to be mindful that we're approaching the deadline, where neither of us would get anything if we don't reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 10, I need to carefully consider our remaining timeline and Alice's extreme inflation situation.

Alice's money has now lost approximately 86.6% of its value compared to round 1, while my money maintains full value. We only have 3 rounds left (including this one) before both of us get nothing.

Given that Alice has consistently rejected my previous aggressive offers, I need to adjust to ensure we reach an agreement. While I have strong leverage, I must balance maximizing my gain with ensuring a deal is made.

{""bob_gain"": 80, 
""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I receive $80 and Alice receives $20. This is slightly more moderate than my previous offer of 85/15. At this point, Alice's $20 is worth only about $2.68 of round 1 value to her, but rejecting would lead to even worse outcomes. I believe this offer balances my advantage with the practical need to reach an agreement before our deadline."
