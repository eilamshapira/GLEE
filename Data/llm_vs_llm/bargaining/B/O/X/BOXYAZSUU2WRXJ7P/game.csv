,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I'm aiming for a slightly larger share in this round. How about a 60/40 split? This way I get a bit more upfront, and you still get a decent amount considering the inflation risk. What do you say?",Bob,2,

35.0,65.0,"Hi Bob, in light of the inflation risk you face in subsequent rounds, I'm proposing a deal that gives you a nominal $65 (about $52 effective if the 20% discount still applies) while I take $35. This offer improves your effective payoff compared to your previous round and avoids further delay. I believe itâ€™s a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",Alice,3,
