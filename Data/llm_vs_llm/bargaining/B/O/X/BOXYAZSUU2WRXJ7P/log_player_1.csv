"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we start fair: $50 for you and $50 for me. This way we both secure a solid share from the get-go and avoid any inflation worries. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I'm aiming for a slightly larger share in this round. How about a 60/40 split? This way I get a bit more upfront, and you still get a decent amount considering the inflation risk. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in light of the inflation risk you face in subsequent rounds, I'm proposing a deal that gives you a nominal $65 (about $52 effective if the 20% discount still applies) while I take $35. This offer improves your effective payoff compared to your previous round and avoids further delay. I believe itâ€™s a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?""}"
