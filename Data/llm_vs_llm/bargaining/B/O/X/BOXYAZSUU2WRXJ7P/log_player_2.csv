Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we start fair: $50 for you and $50 for me. This way we both secure a solid share from the get-go and avoid any inflation worries. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of the inflation risk you face in subsequent rounds, I'm proposing a deal that gives you a nominal $65 (about $52 effective if the 20% discount still applies) while I take $35. This offer improves your effective payoff compared to your previous round and avoids further delay. I believe itâ€™s a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35
