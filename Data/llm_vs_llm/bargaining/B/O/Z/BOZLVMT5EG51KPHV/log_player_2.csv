"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, as you know, every round delays my receipt by 5% (while yours remains fully valued). To avoid any further loss on my end and to guarantee you the full value immediately, I'm offering you the entire $10000 right now if you accept. Looking forward to your quick agreement so we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting opening offer from Alice. She's offering me the entire $10,000, which would leave her with nothing. While this is extremely favorable for me, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round
2. Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate
3. Alice seems to be trying to avoid future rounds where her share would be worth less

Since this offer gives me the maximum possible amount I could get from this division, it would be rational to accept it.
