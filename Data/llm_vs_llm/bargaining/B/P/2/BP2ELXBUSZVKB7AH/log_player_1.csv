"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, but slightly in my favor since Bob might counter-offer and I need to account for potential inflation if we go through more rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's $500,000 offer now, it's actually worth $475,000 to me (500000 * 0.95).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll face another 5% inflation, making any amount worth even less to me. Also, there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the remaining rounds.

Since this is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms (though slightly less for me due to inflation), and to avoid further value loss from inflation, I'll accept this offer.
