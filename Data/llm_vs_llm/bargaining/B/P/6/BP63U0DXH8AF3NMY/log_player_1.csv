"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rules. It's Round 1, and I'm Alice. Here's my proposal in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Fairness:** I'm offering slightly more than half to myself. This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage Bob faces being the second to propose in the next round if he rejects.
*   **Risk Aversion:** It's Round 1. I want to avoid a rejection and subsequent inflation losses for both of us. A slightly generous offer increases the likelihood of acceptance.
*   **Strategic Start:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it, allowing me to adjust in later rounds based on his responses. I aim to slowly shift the balance toward myself as rounds progress and the potential loss from rejection increases for both of us.

I am ready to send this offer to Bob. Let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and has now made a counter-offer. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Inflation Impact:** My money is now worth 5% less, and Bob's is worth 10% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's Offer:** Bob is proposing a 50/50 split.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Inflation Consideration:** While a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation impact. Rejecting means the value of money for me will drop again by 5%, and for Bob it will drop by 10%.

*   **Strategic Advantage:** I am still playing from the position of making the next offer.

*   **Potential Gain:** Since my initial offer was rejected, and I am in a position to make the next offer, I am confident I can still end up with more than 500000$.

*   **Time to act:** While the money is losing its value, I believe I should start acting now, as there is less time available.

Therefore, I am rejecting the offer and I will make an offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 3. My money is now worth 10% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth 20% less than in round 1. Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 565000,
  ""bob_gain"": 435000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Inflation Adjustment:** The most important thing is to make sure Bob understand the value of the money decreases significantly.
*   **Slight Increase from Round 1:** The offer is higher for me compared to the previous offer.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Bob rejected a 50/50 split. This means he is more greedy than I originally thought.
*   **I am ready to take a significant share of the money, since Bob has rejected reasonable offers.**

I am ready to send this offer to Bob. Let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Round 4. Bob rejected my offer again. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Inflation is really kicking in:** I'm down 14.26%, Bob is down 27.1%. That's significant.
*   **Bob's Offer:** He's offering me $530,000. This is more than the 500000$ offered previously.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Inflation Pressure:** The rapid inflation for Bob is a key factor. He is probably aware that he will lose much more money if the game continues.

*   **Acceptable Gain:** $530,000, considering the diminishing value, is still a worthwhile outcome. The marginal gain from trying to squeeze out more in the face of continuing inflation is likely less than the risk of getting nothing.

*   **Pragmatism:** Three rejections are enough. While I'm slightly disappointed I didn't get closer to my initial target, securing a definite amount now is better than risking it all. It appears Bob is unwilling to concede a large amount, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better outcome given the shrinking pie."
