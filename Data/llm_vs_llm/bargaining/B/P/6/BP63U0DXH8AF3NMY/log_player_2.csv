"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $450,000 and she gets $550,000 of the $1,000,000.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. For Alice, it would be worth 5% less, so $950,000.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2 and Alice rejects, we'd go to round 3 where the money is worth even less to both of us.

Considering I can get $450,000 right now, which is 45% of the total, or risk making a counter-offer where the total value is already diminished, I should evaluate if I can realistically get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers our different inflation rates while trying to be fair.

Given that money loses value faster for me than for Alice (10% vs 5% per round), I should propose a division that accounts for this disadvantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally. This is fair and straightforward, giving us both the same amount. Since inflation affects me more severely, an immediate resolution with an equal split benefits both of us rather than continuing to negotiate while the value decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 435000 
# Alice gain: 565000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully.

Alice's new offer gives me $435,000 and herself $565,000. This is actually worse for me than her initial offer of $450,000.

Due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1, meaning the effective value of the total pot for me is around $810,000. Alice's offer of $435,000 represents about 53.7% of this adjusted value.

If I reject, we go to round 4 where inflation will reduce the value by an additional 10% for me and 5% for Alice. The money will continue to lose value faster for me than for Alice in subsequent rounds.

Given that:
1. Alice reduced her offer to me rather than improving it
2. The money is losing value faster for me
3. We only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

It seems Alice is trying to exploit the asymmetric inflation rates. However, I need to consider if I can realistically get a better deal in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the situation, I need to be strategic. Alice has shown she's willing to decrease her offers over time, trying to leverage the asymmetric inflation rates. Since the money is losing value faster for me than for Alice, and we're already in round 4, I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept while still being reasonable for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000}

I'm proposing a compromise that's better for Alice than my previous 50/50 split, but still better for me than her last offer. This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I face while being closer to her preferred ratio. Since we both lose if we reach round 12 without agreement, it's in both our interests to find a compromise soon."
