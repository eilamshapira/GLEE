Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm adjusting my offer to be a bit more generous. This is still a good deal for both of us considering the time value of money. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is larger than her first, it's still heavily in her favor. The information about inflation affecting her gains makes me think pushing for a more even split is possible."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob. This is a 50/50 split. It's the fairest deal we can make at this point. Let's end this now and both of us benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally willing to split the money evenly. While we could push for more in later rounds, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting this offer ensures a fair and substantial sum."
