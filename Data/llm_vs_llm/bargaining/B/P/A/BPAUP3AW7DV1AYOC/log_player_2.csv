"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round:
   * My $500,000 would only be worth $475,000 in current value
   * Any amount I get will be worth 5% less
4. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky

Given that this is a fair initial offer and inflation will reduce the value of any future gains, I should accept this offer.
