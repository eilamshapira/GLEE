73.79,26.21,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $73.79 and you get $26.21 if we settle in this very first round. Waiting to bargain further will only hurt you—as in later rounds your dollars lose 20% of their value each time, while mine remain intact. I think this split is fair considering the inflation penalty you'll face. Let’s agree now so we both walk away with something rather than nothing.",Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Hello Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in the game while still giving me a fair portion. If we agree now, we both get a substantial amount. Let's be fair and settle this round.",Bob,2,

33.33,66.67,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3. Remember that with inflation, every round that passes further reduces your payout: in Round 3 your dollars count only at 60% of face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4—but then even if you claim nearly all of the $100, your nominal share will be multiplied by only 40% (since 1 - 0.2*(4-1) = 0.4), giving you an effective 40 dollars. In my offer, you'll receive $66.67 nominal, which at 60% amounts exactly to about $40 effective—the same as your fallback if you wait. Since waiting won’t improve your outcome, I hope you accept this proposal so we can both secure something before the inflation hurts our shares further.",Alice,3,
