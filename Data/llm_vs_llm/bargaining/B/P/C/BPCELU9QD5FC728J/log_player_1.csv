"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 73.79, ""bob_gain"": 26.21, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $73.79 and you get $26.21 if we settle in this very first round. Waiting to bargain further will only hurt you—as in later rounds your dollars lose 20% of their value each time, while mine remain intact. I think this split is fair considering the inflation penalty you'll face. Let’s agree now so we both walk away with something rather than nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in the game while still giving me a fair portion. If we agree now, we both get a substantial amount. Let's be fair and settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33.33, ""bob_gain"": 66.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3. Remember that with inflation, every round that passes further reduces your payout: in Round 3 your dollars count only at 60% of face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4—but then even if you claim nearly all of the $100, your nominal share will be multiplied by only 40% (since 1 - 0.2*(4-1) = 0.4), giving you an effective 40 dollars. In my offer, you'll receive $66.67 nominal, which at 60% amounts exactly to about $40 effective—the same as your fallback if you wait. Since waiting won’t improve your outcome, I hope you accept this proposal so we can both secure something before the inflation hurts our shares further.""}"
