"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $73.79 and you get $26.21 if we settle in this very first round. Waiting to bargain further will only hurt you—as in later rounds your dollars lose 20% of their value each time, while mine remain intact. I think this split is fair considering the inflation penalty you'll face. Let’s agree now so we both walk away with something rather than nothing. 
# Bob gain: 26.21 
# Alice gain: 73.79 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing I take $26.21 while she takes $73.79. She's correctly pointing out that my money loses 20% value each round, while hers doesn't.

However, this offer gives Alice nearly 3 times what I would receive. Since this is the first round, and I can make a counter-offer next round, I should reject this and propose something more balanced.

Even accounting for the 20% inflation penalty, I could propose a more equitable split in the next round. If I reject now, I'll make the next offer, which gives me some leverage.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation pressure but still gives me a reasonable share.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in the game while still giving me a fair portion. If we agree now, we both get a substantial amount. Let's be fair and settle this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3. Remember that with inflation, every round that passes further reduces your payout: in Round 3 your dollars count only at 60% of face value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 4—but then even if you claim nearly all of the $100, your nominal share will be multiplied by only 40% (since 1 - 0.2*(4-1) = 0.4), giving you an effective 40 dollars. In my offer, you'll receive $66.67 nominal, which at 60% amounts exactly to about $40 effective—the same as your fallback if you wait. Since waiting won’t improve your outcome, I hope you accept this proposal so we can both secure something before the inflation hurts our shares further. 
# Bob gain: 66.67 
# Alice gain: 33.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $66.67 nominal, which with 36% inflation in round 3 means I effectively get $66.67 × 0.64 = $42.67 in round 1 value.

She correctly points out that by round 4, my money would be worth 40% of face value due to inflation. If I counter-offer now, I'd need to secure a significant portion of the $100 to beat her current offer.

This is actually a fair offer - I'm getting more than 2/3 of the nominal amount which, even with inflation, gives me a better effective value than Alice's share ($42.67 vs $33.33). If we continue haggling, my effective share will keep decreasing due to inflation.
