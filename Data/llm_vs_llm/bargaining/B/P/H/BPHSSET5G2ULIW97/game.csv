2083.0,7917.0,"Hi Bob, based on our different discount rates (20% devaluation for me per round and only 5% for you), if we continue bargaining the money will lose value. To reflect our future alternatives, I'm suggesting that you receive $7917 and I receive $2083. This offer gives you at least what you'd expect if you waited another round while sparing both of us further devaluation. I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,1,
