"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, based on our different discount rates (20% devaluation for me per round and only 5% for you), if we continue bargaining the money will lose value. To reflect our future alternatives, I'm suggesting that you receive $7917 and I receive $2083. This offer gives you at least what you'd expect if you waited another round while sparing both of us further devaluation. I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 7917 
# Alice gain: 2083 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer based on our different discount rates.

If I reject this offer, we proceed to the next round where:
- I would propose the split
- But the money would be worth 5% less to me
- And 20% less to Alice

The total amount would still be $10,000, but its value to me would be $9,500 and to Alice just $8,000.

Alice is offering me $7,917 now, which is 79.17% of the current value. This is a good offer considering the diminishing value in future rounds, especially since Alice's bargaining position weakens more quickly than mine due to her higher discount rate.
