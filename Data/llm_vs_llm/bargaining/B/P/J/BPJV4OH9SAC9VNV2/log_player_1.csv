"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but you still get a substantial amount. The value of the money is decreasing for you with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money for me, I should weigh my options carefully.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, the $400,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $380,000 to me (400000 * 0.95).

I'll think about it... 

My decision: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, the money is now worth 5% * 2 = 10% less for me compared to the first round, and then another 5% less, so in total 15% less (1 - 0.95 * 0.95).

To calculate the value, I'll consider that $1,000,000 is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $902,500 to me.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, inflation is eating away at my share""
}
```"
