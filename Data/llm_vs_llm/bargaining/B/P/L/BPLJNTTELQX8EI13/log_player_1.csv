"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer, considering that money is worth less to Bob with each round due to the 20% inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I believe this is a fair starting offer. I'm giving Bob a substantial part of the money now, which is worth more to him than waiting for later rounds due to his 20% inflation penalty per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more balanced offer, taking into account Bob's inflation penalty:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Bob a larger share than my previous offer. Since Bob faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, and this offer provides him with a substantial portion of the total amount."
