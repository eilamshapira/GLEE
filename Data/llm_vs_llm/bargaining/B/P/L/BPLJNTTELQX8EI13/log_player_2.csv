"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $3,000 while she gets $7,000 of the $10,000 total. 

I should keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while Alice doesn't face this penalty. This gives Alice a strategic advantage in later rounds.

If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 20% less. So my maximum potential gain would be reduced.

Given this significant disadvantage with delay, and that $3,000 is better than potentially ending with nothing after 12 rounds, I'll reject this offer since I believe I can propose a more equitable distribution in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers our respective positions in this game.

Taking into account the inflation penalty that affects only me, I should propose a more favorable split than what Alice offered, but also recognize the bargaining dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which is fair and equitable. This gives us both $5,000. Since I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round and you're not, this even split acknowledges our equal positions in the game while accounting for my disadvantage in delaying. If we continue to future rounds, my effective value will decrease while yours remains stable, putting me at a disadvantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in the context of our game dynamics.

Alice is now offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000. This is an improvement from her initial offer of $3,000 to me.

Due to inflation, my portion is now worth 36% less than in the first round. So $4,000 now is effectively worth only $2,560 compared to round 1 value ($4,000 Ã— 0.64 = $2,560).

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even greater inflation (likely 48% less than round 1), making any future amount worth significantly less to me.

Alice seems to be strategically increasing her offers while knowing my disadvantage grows with each round. Given this inflation pressure and the improved offer, I should accept.
