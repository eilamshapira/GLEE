"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is an equitable division that recognizes both of our positions in this negotiation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I notice that inflation is affecting me much more than you, Alice. With the decreasing value of money for me each round, I need to secure a larger portion to achieve a fair outcome. This offer of $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you accounts for the inflation difference between us while still giving you a substantial portion."
