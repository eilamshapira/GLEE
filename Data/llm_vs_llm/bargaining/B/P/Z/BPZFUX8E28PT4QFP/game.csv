6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing to split the $10000 by giving you $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. Since every round reduces the value of the money by 10% for me, I'd like us to agree quickly. I believe this is a fair start given the time sensitivity. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",Alice,1,
