Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, my $45 will be worth approximately $45 * 0.81 = $36.45 (since it's 19% less than the original value).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing for me. In round 1, it was $100, in round 2, it was $100 * 0.9 = $90, in round 3, it was $90 * 0.9 = $81, and now in round 4, it's $81 * 0.9 = $72.9.

To maximize my gain, I'll make a new offer.
