"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Given that I'm faced with time pressure due to inflation (10% less value each round for me), I should propose a fair division that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that respects equal treatment for both of us, and avoids the risk of rejection which would decrease the value of my share due to inflation."
