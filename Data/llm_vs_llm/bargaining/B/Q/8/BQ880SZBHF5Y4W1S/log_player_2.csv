"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 285714.29 
# Alice gain: 714285.71 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Currently offered: $285,714.29
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * I'll have more control over the proposal

The current offer gives Alice about 71% and me about 29% of the total.
This is quite uneven, and since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer where the value depreciation won't hurt as much (given the 10% vs 20% difference), I should reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice knows that in the next round (if she rejects):
1. Her money will be worth 10% less
2. My money will be worth 20% less
3. She'll get to make the next offer

I should offer a split that's attractive enough for her to accept now, considering these factors. A 60-40 split in her favor should be reasonable, as waiting would actually give her less value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I propose this split of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice. This gives her a clear majority while still being more balanced than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $200,000
2. Due to 36% inflation for me, this $200,000 is actually worth only $128,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * My money will be worth 48.8% less than round 1 (additional 20%)
   * Alice's money will be worth 27.1% less than round 1 (additional 10%)
   * Any future negotiations will be severely impacted by inflation

Alice's offer is actually worse than her first offer in absolute terms. However, given the severe inflation penalty I'm facing (20% per round vs Alice's 10%), continuing to negotiate will hurt me more than it hurts Alice. The gap between our inflation rates means my bargaining position gets worse each round.

Reluctantly, I should accept this offer as further negotiations will likely result in even worse outcomes for me due to the asymmetric inflation penalties.
