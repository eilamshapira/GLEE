"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% loss in value each round, I can use this to my advantage but still need to make it appealing enough.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($4000)
2. If Bob rejects, their next round's $4000 would be worth only $3800 to them
3. It's a reasonable first offer that shows willingness to share while maintaining my interests"
