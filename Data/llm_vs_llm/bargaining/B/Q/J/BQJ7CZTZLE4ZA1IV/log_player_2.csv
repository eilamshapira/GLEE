"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I take $4,000 while she takes $6,000. 

With inflation affecting only my share (5% per round), waiting comes at a cost to me. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total pot's value to me will decrease, while it stays the same for Alice.

Let me calculate what my $4,000 would be worth if I waited another round: $4,000 Ã— 0.95 = $3,800. So I'd need to secure more than $3,800 in the next round to make waiting worthwhile.

While a 40/60 split isn't perfectly equal, given the inflation penalty I face, this is actually a reasonable first offer. If I reject, I lose 5% of my potential value, giving Alice more leverage.
