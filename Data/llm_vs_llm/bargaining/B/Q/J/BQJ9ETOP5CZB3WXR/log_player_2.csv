"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on Alice's offer, I need to decide whether to accept or reject it.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, while she would get $600,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth only $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and propose a better split next round, even if I suggested a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), after the 20% inflation my $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me - the same as accepting Alice's current offer.

Since there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer (and further rounds would lead to even more inflation for me), the rational choice is to accept this offer.
