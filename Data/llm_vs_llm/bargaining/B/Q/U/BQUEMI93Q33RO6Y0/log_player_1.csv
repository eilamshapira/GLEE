"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and Bob's offer.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** I would get $45, but because of the 20% inflation from my perspective, the real value is 0.8 * $45 = $36.
*   **Bob's perspective:** I don't know the real value for Bob, but the nominal offer is Bob gets 55$.

Given the inflation affecting me and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** I would get $40. The total inflation I have to account for now is 48.8%. The real value of $40 is 40 * (1 - 0.488) = $20.48
*   **Bob's Perspective:** I don't know Bob's real value, but he would get $60.

Considering the inflation and the fact that there are still several rounds left (and the risk of getting nothing at all) I will have to **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5, accounting for the accumulated inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break down the situation:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** I would receive $35. Considering the 67.23% inflation, the real value is $35 * (1 - 0.6723) = $11.47.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob receives $65. I don't know the actual effect of inflation on Bob.

I'm in a tough spot with the inflation. I still have a few rounds left. Given the low value I'd receive now, and the chance of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I have to **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7, considering the further impact of inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's evaluate:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** I'd get $30. With 79.03% inflation, the real value is $30 * (1 - 0.7903) = $6.29.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets $70. I don't know his inflation.

Given the current situation and the low value I'd receive with that much inflation, I must **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 9:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```"
