"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer from Alice...

Current value for me (Bob) with 10% inflation in Round 1: $4,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 2, any amount would be worth 10% less to me. Even if I got the full $10,000 in Round 2, it would only be worth $9,000 to me.

While $4,000 isn't an equal split, it's still a significant amount, and the risk of further inflation and potential rejection of my counter-offer makes this a reasonable proposal.
