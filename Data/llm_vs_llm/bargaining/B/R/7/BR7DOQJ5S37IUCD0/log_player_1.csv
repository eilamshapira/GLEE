"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer for the first round. I should consider the inflation effect on my gains - since the money will be worth 5% less for me each round, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a fair portion. Given that I'll face inflation if we move to another round, it's better for me to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
