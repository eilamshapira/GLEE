"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* I'm being offered $45 out of $100
* If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
* $45 in next round would only be worth $42.75 to me
* Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
* Getting $45 now is better than risking a lower effective amount later
