"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation pressure for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a slightly favorable split for me at 55%-45%. This accounts for the inflation risk I face if we go to another round, but still gives Bob a substantial portion. I believe this is fair and reasonable given our circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because due to inflation, if I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth even less to me (another 20% reduction). Getting $450,000 now at 80% value (equivalent to $360,000 in round 1 value) is better than risking further devaluation by continuing to negotiate."
