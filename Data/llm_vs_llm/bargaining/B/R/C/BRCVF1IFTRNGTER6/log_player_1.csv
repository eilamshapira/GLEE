Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle this now. As every extra round chips away at my share's value, I'm offering you 65 and keeping 35. I believe this is fair given the cost of delayâ€”let's agree now and avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
