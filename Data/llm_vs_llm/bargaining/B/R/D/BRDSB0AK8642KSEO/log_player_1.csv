"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal that is enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money for him each round. Since it's the first round, I'll start with a relatively fair offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $4900 for me and $5100 for him. I need to consider the inflation for Bob and the fact that we're only in round 2. If I reject, I'll have to make another offer, and Bob's potential gains will decrease further. $4900 is a reasonable amount for me.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
