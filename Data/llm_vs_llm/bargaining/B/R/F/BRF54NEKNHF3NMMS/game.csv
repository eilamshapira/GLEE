6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! Since the money doesn't lose value for me but loses 20% value for you each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different time preferences.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the value loss, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering the initial amount. Let's settle this round to minimize the impact of inflation on my share.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, consider the time pressure you're facing - your money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't. If we go another round, your $5000 would effectively be worth only $4000 to you. This offer of $3500 now is worth more to you than getting less in real value later. Let's conclude this efficiently before inflation further reduces your share's value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I see the impact of inflation, but I believe $4000 is a fair amount for me at this point. It's still a significant portion, and agreeing now would prevent further loss in real value for me. Let's end this round and share the money.",Bob,4,
