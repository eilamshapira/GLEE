"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the value loss, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering the initial amount. Let's settle this round to minimize the impact of inflation on my share.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, consider the time pressure you're facing - your money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't. If we go another round, your $5000 would effectively be worth only $4000 to you. This offer of $3500 now is worth more to you than getting less in real value later. Let's conclude this efficiently before inflation further reduces your share's value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see the impact of inflation, but I believe $4000 is a fair amount for me at this point. It's still a significant portion, and agreeing now would prevent further loss in real value for me. Let's end this round and share the money. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000
