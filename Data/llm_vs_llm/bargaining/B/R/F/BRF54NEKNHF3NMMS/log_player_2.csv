"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since the money doesn't lose value for me but loses 20% value for you each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different time preferences. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the value loss, but I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering the initial amount. Let's settle this round to minimize the impact of inflation on my share.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider the time pressure you're facing - your money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't. If we go another round, your $5000 would effectively be worth only $4000 to you. This offer of $3500 now is worth more to you than getting less in real value later. Let's conclude this efficiently before inflation further reduces your share's value. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I see the impact of inflation, but I believe $4000 is a fair amount for me at this point. It's still a significant portion, and agreeing now would prevent further loss in real value for me. Let's end this round and share the money.""
