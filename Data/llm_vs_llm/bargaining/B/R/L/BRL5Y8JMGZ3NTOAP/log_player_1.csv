"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, and we are now in the 3rd round (with the 1st round being the initial state), the total amount is effectively 1,000,000 * (0.8)^2 = 640,000.

However, for the purpose of the game and clarity, I will continue to use the original $1,000,000 as the base for calculations, keeping in mind the actual value decreases by 20% each round.

Given that, my offer for this round, aiming for a more balanced distribution considering the decreasing value, would be:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}"
