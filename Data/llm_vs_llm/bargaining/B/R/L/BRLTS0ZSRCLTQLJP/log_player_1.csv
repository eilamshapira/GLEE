"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I am Alice, and I want to maximize my earnings while considering the diminishing value of the money for both me and Bob. It's Round 1, and I'm making the offer.

Here's my offer, taking into account Bob's 5% decrease in value each round:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

I'm aiming for a slight advantage for myself, but not so greedy that Bob will immediately reject it. I'm offering him $4750 in the first round. This ensures he will start with a decent amount of money from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. This is Round 2. My money is worth the same as Round 1, and Bob's is worth 5% less than Round 1.

Bob is offering me $4900. I need to consider if this is better than waiting for Round 3, where I would make the offer again, but my position hasn't changed from the first round.

Bob's money is now worth 95% of its original value. So his $5100 is worth $5100 * 0.95 = $4845 to him in original value.

If I reject this offer, I get to make an offer in round 3. Since the money for me has not changed value, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer, which I find very generous in this round.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
