Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, 60/40 split. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much.  Let's split it 65/35, I'll take 65% and you get 35%.  This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:**  My potential gains are decreasing faster than Alice's. Waiting longer hurts me more.
* **Trend:** Alice's offer is getting better.  She started at 90/10, now it's 65/35.  If I push further, I risk her becoming less generous.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a decent sum. Rejecting risks getting even less if Alice gets tougher in the next round. 

It's a gamble either way, but taking the sure bet at this stage seems like the less risky option for Bob."
