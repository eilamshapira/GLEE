4500.0,5500.0,"Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 10%, this offer is better than waiting for another round. You'd get $4500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in the next round.",Bob,2,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, consider this carefully. With 29% devaluation for you, your $3500 now is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. If we continue, your purchasing power will keep decreasing while mine stays the same. This is the best offer you'll get.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. This is a compromise to end this before it gets any worse for me.",Alice,5,

2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your money has lost over 44% of its value. This $2500 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in the next round, where you'll lose even more value. I have no pressure from inflation, so I can wait indefinitely. This is a rational offer given our positions.",Bob,6,
