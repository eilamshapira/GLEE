Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 10%, this offer is better than waiting for another round. You'd get $4500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this carefully. With 29% devaluation for you, your $3500 now is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. If we continue, your purchasing power will keep decreasing while mine stays the same. This is the best offer you'll get.

# Bob gain: 6500

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your money has lost over 44% of its value. This $2500 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in the next round, where you'll lose even more value. I have no pressure from inflation, so I can wait indefinitely. This is a rational offer given our positions. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, and ideally, I would hold out for more. However, the longer this goes on, the less my potential gains are worth. Accepting Bob's offer, while far from ideal, prevents further losses due to the constant devaluation."
