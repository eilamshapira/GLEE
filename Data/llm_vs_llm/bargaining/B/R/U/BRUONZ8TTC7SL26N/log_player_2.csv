"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000 and taking $6000 for herself. This isn't an equal split. If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where:
1. I can make a counter-offer
2. The money will be worth 10% less to Alice (but same for me)
3. Alice would only get 90% of whatever amount in the next round

I can likely make a better offer in the next round that Alice would be more inclined to accept, given the time pressure affects her more than me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 10% less to Alice, I can use this to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a more favorable split while still making it worthwhile for Alice to accept rather than risk another round where she'd lose another 10% value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 10%, this offer is better than waiting for another round. You'd get $4500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tides have turned, Bob. I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, which is better than her first offer of $4000
2. For Alice, the $5500 she's getting is actually worth only $4455 (due to 19% reduction)
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - The money will be worth even less to Alice (29% less than original)
   - I maintain my negotiating power since inflation doesn't affect me

Given that I can still leverage the increasing inflation pressure on Alice in the next round to potentially get an even better deal, and that there's no downside for me to wait...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Now Alice is under even more pressure since the money will be worth 29% less to her. I can leverage this to get a better deal, but I also need to make it attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, consider this carefully. With 29% devaluation for you, your $3500 now is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. If we continue, your purchasing power will keep decreasing while mine stays the same. This is the best offer you'll get.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. This is a compromise to end this before it gets any worse for me. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5500, which is the highest offer from her so far
2. For Alice, her $4500 is now worth only about $2953 (due to 34.39% reduction)
3. If I reject:
   - We go to another round where I can make an offer
   - The money will be worth even less to Alice (around 44% less than original)
   - I still maintain my full purchasing power

Given that:
- I'm getting a better amount than before ($5500)
- Alice is already taking a significant hit due to inflation
- There's still room for me to negotiate an even better deal in the next round since Alice's position keeps weakening
- I have no downsides to waiting

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, Alice's money has lost significant value (would be about 44% less valuable in this round). I can now push for an even more favorable split since waiting is extremely costly for her but costs me nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your money has lost over 44% of its value. This $2500 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in the next round, where you'll lose even more value. I have no pressure from inflation, so I can wait indefinitely. This is a rational offer given our positions.""}"
