"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $30 out of $100. Since I know that:
1. Money doesn't lose value for me between rounds
2. Money loses 20% value for Alice each round
3. I get to make the next offer if I reject

If I reject and we go to round 2:
- For me, $100 is still worth $100
- For Alice, $100 will only be worth $80
- This gives me more negotiating power

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round when Alice will be more motivated to accept due to the depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, she would now value $100 as only $80. This gives me leverage to propose a more favorable split for myself.

I'll propose a split that gives me a larger share but still gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than move to another round where her share would depreciate further.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. For me, this means $60
2. For Alice, $40 now is better than potentially getting less in real value next round due to the 20% depreciation
3. It's still a meaningful amount for both parties"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $30
2. For Alice, the $55 she would get is actually worth only $35.20 (64% of $55) due to inflation
3. If I reject:
   - We go to round 4
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will depreciate even further (by 48.8%)
   - I would likely be able to negotiate an even better deal

Since my money doesn't lose value and Alice is facing significant depreciation, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round when Alice will be under even more pressure to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, due to inflation:
1. For me, $100 is still worth $100
2. For Alice, due to 48.8% depreciation, $100 would only be worth about $51.20

Given this significant depreciation for Alice, she should be much more motivated to accept a deal now rather than risk further loss of value. I can propose a split more in my favor while still ensuring it's better for her than continuing to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This offer makes sense because:
1. For me, this means $70 real value
2. For Alice, $30 now (worth about $15.36 in real value to her) is still better than risking another round of 20% depreciation
3. The offer still leaves Alice with something meaningful rather than being too aggressive and risking rejection"
