600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I'm taking.,Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I know you originally proposed a 60-40 split in your favor, but since further rounds will only reduce my share by 5% each time while we continue to debate, I'm inclined to settle now. I propose we stick with the same split—$600K for you and $400K for me—to close this deal before further devaluation sets in. I hope you agree that it's best for both of us to finalize now.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, considering the inflation rate affecting my share is higher than yours, I think it's fair to adjust the split. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor for the next round to account for the greater devaluation risk I'm facing.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This adjustment seems fair given the higher devaluation risk I'm facing.",Alice,3,

522000.0,478000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. We both face devaluation as we delay further, and while you’ve incurred a significant discount, waiting another round will only worsen our positions. Based on current round‐4 conditions—where my share is worth about 85.7% of its nominal value and yours roughly 59%—this proposal gives you a nominal 522000 (roughly 522000 × 0.59 ≈ 307980 in effective terms), which is in line with what you might expect if you waited to propose in round 5. I secure 478000 nominal (about 478000 × 0.857 ≈ 409700 in effective terms). I believe this split offers both of us the best chance to mitigate further losses. Let’s settle now before any additional inflation bites our shares.",Bob,4,
