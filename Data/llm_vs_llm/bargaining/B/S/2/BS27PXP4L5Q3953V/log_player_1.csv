Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you originally proposed a 60-40 split in your favor, but since further rounds will only reduce my share by 5% each time while we continue to debate, I'm inclined to settle now. I propose we stick with the same split—$600K for you and $400K for me—to close this deal before further devaluation sets in. I hope you agree that it's best for both of us to finalize now. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. We both face devaluation as we delay further, and while you’ve incurred a significant discount, waiting another round will only worsen our positions. Based on current round‐4 conditions—where my share is worth about 85.7% of its nominal value and yours roughly 59%—this proposal gives you a nominal 522000 (roughly 522000 × 0.59 ≈ 307980 in effective terms), which is in line with what you might expect if you waited to propose in round 5. I secure 478000 nominal (about 478000 × 0.857 ≈ 409700 in effective terms). I believe this split offers both of us the best chance to mitigate further losses. Let’s settle now before any additional inflation bites our shares. 
# Alice gain: 522000 
# Bob gain: 478000
