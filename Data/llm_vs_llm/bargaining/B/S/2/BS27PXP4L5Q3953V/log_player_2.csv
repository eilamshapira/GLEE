Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you originally proposed a 60-40 split in your favor, but since further rounds will only reduce my share by 5% each time while we continue to debate, I'm inclined to settle now. I propose we stick with the same split—$600K for you and $400K for me—to close this deal before further devaluation sets in. I hope you agree that it's best for both of us to finalize now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This adjustment seems fair given the higher devaluation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 478000, ""alice_gain"": 522000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. We both face devaluation as we delay further, and while you’ve incurred a significant discount, waiting another round will only worsen our positions. Based on current round‐4 conditions—where my share is worth about 85.7% of its nominal value and yours roughly 59%—this proposal gives you a nominal 522,000 (roughly 522,000 × 0.59 ≈ 307,980 in effective terms), which is in line with what you might expect if you waited to propose in round 5. I secure 478,000 nominal (about 478,000 × 0.857 ≈ 409,700 in effective terms). I believe this split offers both of us the best chance to mitigate further losses. Let’s settle now before any additional inflation bites our shares.""}"
