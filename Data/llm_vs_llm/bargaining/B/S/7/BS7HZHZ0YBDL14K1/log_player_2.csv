"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 20% for me, meaning the $100 will effectively be worth $80 from my perspective. Even if I could get a larger share in the next round, I need to factor in this significant depreciation.

With the current offer, I get $40. If I reject, in the best case scenario of getting even $60 in the next round, that would only be worth $48 to me due to the 20% inflation ($60 * 0.8 = $48).

While a 40-60 split isn't ideal, given the inflation penalty, it's probably better to accept this offer rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
