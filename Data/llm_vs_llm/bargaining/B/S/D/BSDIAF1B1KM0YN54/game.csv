500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, let's avoid the inflation trap by settling now. I propose a fair 50/50 split of the $1000000. This ensures both of us secure the maximum real value before any further rounds dilute our share. Please accept and let's wrap this up efficiently!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. How about I take 550000$ and you take 450000$? This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation impact on me.",Bob,2,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, with each round my share loses 5% of its value, so delaying further hurts my effective gains. I propose a division where you get $520000 and I get $480000. This way, you secure a slightly larger nominal amount while I avoid further erosion, making it a win‐win compared to dragging the negotiation on. I hope we can finalize the deal now before time takes a bigger toll!",Alice,3,

430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about the inflation effects on your share. How about I take 570000$ and you take 430000$? This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation impact on me.",Bob,4,

470000.0,530000.0,"Bob, we're in Round 5 and every moment that passes eats away at my share – and I wager yours will suffer even more if we keep delaying. To avoid locking in further losses, I'm proposing we settle now: I take $470000 and you get $530000. This deal gives you a clear nominal advantage over my share, making it more attractive than risking another round with even steeper devaluation. Let's secure our best possible outcome now rather than gamble on tomorrow's tougher terms.",Alice,5,
