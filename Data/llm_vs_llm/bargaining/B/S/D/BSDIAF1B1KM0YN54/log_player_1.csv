Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. How about I take 550000$ and you take 450000$? This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation impact on me.

# Bob gain: 550000

To avoid locking in further losses, I'm proposing we settle now: I take $470,000 and you get $530,000. This deal gives you a clear nominal advantage over my share, making it more attractive than risking another round with even steeper devaluation. Let's secure our best possible outcome now rather than gamble on tomorrow's tougher terms.""}"
