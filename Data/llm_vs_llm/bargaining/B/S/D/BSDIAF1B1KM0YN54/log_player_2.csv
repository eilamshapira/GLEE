"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's avoid the inflation trap by settling now. I propose a fair 50/50 split of the $1000000. This ensures both of us secure the maximum real value before any further rounds dilute our share. Please accept and let's wrap this up efficiently! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Hi Alice, while your offer is fair, I think the inflation affects me more than it might affect you. Let's continue to the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. How about I take 550,000$ and you take 450,000$? This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation impact on me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with each round my share loses 5% of its value, so delaying further hurts my effective gains. I propose a division where you get $520000 and I get $480000. This way, you secure a slightly larger nominal amount while I avoid further erosion, making it a win‐win compared to dragging the negotiation on. I hope we can finalize the deal now before time takes a bigger toll! 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice, I appreciate your concern about the inflation effects on you. However, I think we can still find a better balance. Let's continue to the next round."

How about I take 570,000$ and you take 430,000$? This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation impact on me.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in Round 5 and every moment that passes eats away at my share – and I wager yours will suffer even more if we keep delaying. To avoid locking in further losses, I'm proposing we settle now: I take $470000 and you get $530000. This deal gives you a clear nominal advantage over my share, making it more attractive than risking another round with even steeper devaluation. Let's secure our best possible outcome now rather than gamble on tomorrow's tougher terms. 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice, I accept your offer. Let's settle the deal here to avoid further losses from inflation."
