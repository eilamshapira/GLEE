"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering that time pressure affects me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, leaving Bob with a substantial portion. This is fair considering I'm making the first move, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that inflation affects me less severely (5%) compared to Bob's severe 20% inflation penalty, it's strategic to continue negotiating. I can make another offer in the next round where the money will still retain more value for me than for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I know Bob is facing higher inflation (20% per round) compared to my 5%, I can offer a more balanced split that would be attractive given the time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

This offer is more favorable to Bob than my first proposal, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a slight advantage for myself. Given Bob's higher inflation rate, this should be more appealing than continuing to future rounds where their share would be worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob is trying to take a larger share (60%) despite facing much steeper inflation (48.8% loss vs my 14.26%)
2. The real value for Bob of their $60 share is only around $30.72 due to their inflation
3. My $40 share would be worth about $34.30 after my inflation
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that would be more beneficial for both of us, considering Bob's severe inflation penalty is making time very costly for them"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given Bob's severe inflation penalty (losing nearly half the value already), I'll make an offer that should be very appealing compared to further delays.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a perfectly equal split now because:
1. Bob's inflation is much worse than mine (48.8% vs 14.26% currently)
2. Each additional round makes Bob's share worth significantly less
3. A 50-50 split now would give Bob more real value than even a 60-40 split in their favor in the next round
4. This shows fairness and should encourage acceptance to avoid further value loss for both of us"
