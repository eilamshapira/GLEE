"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, the inflation is working against me significantly more than it is against her. It's still better for me to hold out and hope for a better deal in a later round, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand to offset the accelerating inflation hitting my potential gains. This offer might seem aggressive, but it reflects the urgency of securing a larger portion sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the rapidly increasing inflation means my position is only getting weaker. Accepting now guarantees me something, whereas continuing to hold out for a better deal carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing at all."
