"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right?

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

A 50-50 split is fair, but since Alice made the first move, I have the opportunity to reject and make a counter-offer. With 10% inflation per round, rejecting would mean we're now dealing with $9,000 in the next round. However, I could propose a slightly better deal for myself.

That said, $5,000 is a substantial amount, and there's risk in rejecting - Alice might respond with a worse offer, or we could end up losing value through multiple rounds of negotiation.

Given that it's a fair initial offer and there's inflation risk, I'll accept.
