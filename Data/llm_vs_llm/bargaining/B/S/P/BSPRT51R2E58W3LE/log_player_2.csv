"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 (10%) while keeping $900,000 (90%)
2. This is the first round, and we have 11 more rounds to negotiate
3. I don't face any inflation penalty, so there's no pressure for me to accept quickly
4. The split seems quite unfair, as a more equitable division would be closer to 50-50

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. There's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while being diplomatic:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split would be fair for both of us. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount and can finish the negotiation early.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me with the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved significantly from her initial 90-10 split to a 60-40 split
2. I now know Alice is affected by inflation (19% less value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $400,000 maintains its full value
4. Alice's $600,000 is actually worth only $486,000 to her due to the 19% inflation
5. This is actually becoming a more balanced deal when accounting for inflation
6. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation will keep increasing for Alice

Given that:
- The split is much more reasonable now
- Alice is clearly trying to compromise
- Alice's inflation penalty makes this closer to a fair split in real value
- Further delays might make it harder to reach an agreement due to increasing inflation for Alice
