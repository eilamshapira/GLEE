"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a fair split, considering the inflation penalty. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

In the first round, $10,000 was worth $10,000 to me. Now, in the second round, due to 20% inflation, the $5,000 offered to me is worth $5,000 * 0.8 = $4,000 to me.

Bob's offer gives us an equal split, but considering the inflation, I'm not getting a bad deal. It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds.
