Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair considering we both get something close to half.  Let's be reasonable and make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split isn't attractive enough given I can still make counter-offers, even with the 5% inflation penalty. I'll make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
