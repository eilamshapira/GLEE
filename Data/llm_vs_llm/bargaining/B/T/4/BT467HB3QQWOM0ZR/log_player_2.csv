"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering me $80, which is a very good offer (80% of the total). In the next round, if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so my $80 would effectively become worth $64. Even if I made a more favorable proposal in the next round, I'd be starting from a lower real value.

Given that:
1. This is a very fair initial offer
2. Inflation will reduce my purchasing power in future rounds
3. There's risk in negotiating further
