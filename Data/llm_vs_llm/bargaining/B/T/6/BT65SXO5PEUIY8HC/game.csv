4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but considering the impact of inflation on me is lower, I suggest a slight adjustment in my favor.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but it actually works against me more than you. My money is worth 20% less each round, while yours is only worth 5% less. Since I lose value much faster, I need a larger portion to compensate for this disadvantage. This split is more equitable when considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,

4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more. However, I still believe that a split more in my favor is justified considering the absolute values at stake. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges both our perspectives.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, we need to find a solution quickly as inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money I receive is now worth nearly 50% less than in round 1, while yours is only devalued by about 14%. The 60-40 split I'm proposing actually results in more equitable final value when accounting for our different inflation rates. Let's agree and end this negotiation before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
