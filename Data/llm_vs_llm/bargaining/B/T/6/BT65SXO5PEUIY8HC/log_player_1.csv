"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob considering the different inflation rates we face. I want to start with a reasonable proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair starting point that gives us both the same amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but considering the impact of inflation on me is lower, I suggest a slight adjustment in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to consider the inflation rates and propose something that accounts for our different situations.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but it actually works against me more than you. My money is worth 20% less each round, while yours is only worth 5% less. Since I lose value much faster, I need a larger portion to compensate for this disadvantage. This split is more equitable when considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more. However, I still believe that a split more in my favor is justified considering the absolute values at stake. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges both our perspectives. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be more strategic considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, we need to find a solution quickly as inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money I receive is now worth nearly 50% less than in round 1, while yours is only devalued by about 14%. The 60-40 split I'm proposing actually results in more equitable final value when accounting for our different inflation rates. Let's agree and end this negotiation before we both lose more value.""}"
