"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair starting point that gives us both the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but considering the impact of inflation on me is lower, I suggest a slight adjustment in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but it actually works against me more than you. My money is worth 20% less each round, while yours is only worth 5% less. Since I lose value much faster, I need a larger portion to compensate for this disadvantage. This split is more equitable when considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more. However, I still believe that a split more in my favor is justified considering the absolute values at stake. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges both our perspectives.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a solution quickly as inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money I receive is now worth nearly 50% less than in round 1, while yours is only devalued by about 14%. The 60-40 split I'm proposing actually results in more equitable final value when accounting for our different inflation rates. Let's agree and end this negotiation before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
