"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to reach an agreement, and it leaves you with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split this right down the middle.  A fair and simple solution, and we both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $5000 is actually worth 20% less to him ($4000 in round 1 value)
3. My $5000 would still be worth the full amount
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less in the next round
5. This is actually a pretty fair offer for me, as I get full value
6. There's risk in rejecting as we only have 10 rounds left
