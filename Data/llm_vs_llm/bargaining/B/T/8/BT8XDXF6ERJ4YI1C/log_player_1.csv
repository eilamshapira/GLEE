"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Given the 5% inflation per round for me, I want to make a fair offer that Bob would likely accept to avoid the inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we both receive an equal share, and I can avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would affect my earnings if we move to another round."
