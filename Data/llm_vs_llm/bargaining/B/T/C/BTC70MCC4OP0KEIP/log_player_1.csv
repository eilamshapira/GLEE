"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects it, we'll go to the next round where my money will be worth 5% less. By offering Bob a substantial portion ($450,000), I'm incentivizing immediate acceptance while still maintaining a reasonable gain for myself. This is a fair offer that acknowledges both the time pressure on my side and Bob's negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is an extremely unfair offer from Bob, giving me only $1 while taking virtually the entire sum. Even with the 5% penalty in the next round, I would still be better off making a counter-proposal. The 5% reduction would only reduce my potential gains by $50,000 per $1,000,000, which is far better than accepting just $1."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and my gains are worth 10% less than the original value (due to two rounds of 5% inflation), I need to adjust my strategy while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering this split because even with the 10% inflation penalty, I would receive an effective value of $540,000 (600000 * 0.9), which is still significant. I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a substantial amount and should be attractive enough to accept. If Bob rejects this, they risk getting a worse offer in future rounds, and they should recognize that I'm willing to continue negotiating rather than accept an unfair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I will reject this second attempt by Bob to claim virtually the entire amount. Even with the compounding inflation penalty (now at 14.26%), accepting just $1 would be worse than continuing to negotiate. If I make a reasonable offer in the next round, even with the inflation penalty, I could still secure a much better outcome than $1. Bob's repeated extremely unfair offers suggest they're trying to exploit the inflation pressure, but the penalty isn't severe enough yet to force me to accept such an inequitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 5 and my gains are now worth about 19% less than the original value (after four rounds of 5% inflation), I'll adjust my offer while maintaining a firm position against Bob's extreme proposals.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering this split because even with the ~19% inflation penalty, I would receive an effective value of approximately $567,000 (700000 * 0.81), which is still substantial. While I'm offering Bob less than my previous offers, this is a strategic response to their repeated unfair proposals of $1. Bob needs to understand that attempting to exploit the inflation penalty with extreme offers won't work, and that reasonable negotiation is the path forward. If Bob rejects this, they risk receiving even less in future rounds, as I'm demonstrating I'm willing to continue rather than accept an unfair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 735100 
# Bob gain: 264900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Given the 22.62% inflation penalty, my actual gain would be $568,840 (735100 * 0.7738). This is actually better than what I would effectively receive from my previous offer of 700,000 under the current inflation rate. Additionally, if I reject this and move to the next round, the increasing inflation penalty would further reduce my potential gains. Bob has finally made a reasonable offer, and it's in my best interest to accept it at this point."
