"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind that with each round, my potential gains are devalued by 20%. I will make a reasonable offer that is likely to be accepted to avoid losing value.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer. Now it's Round 2, and my potential winnings are worth 20% less. Bob is offering me $400,000. Let's calculate the present value of $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

If I reject and proceed to Round 3, the value will be $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $640,000

Given the rapidly decreasing value and that Bob is making an offer, I will accept now.

""decision"": ""accept""
