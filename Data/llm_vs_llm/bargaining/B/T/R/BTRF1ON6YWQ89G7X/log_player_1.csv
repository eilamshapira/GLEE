"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair and reasonable offer, considering we both want to optimize our gains and that the money loses value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split - $500,000 for each of us. This is fair and avoids potentially losing rounds to inflation where we'd both get less."
