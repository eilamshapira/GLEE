"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I accept now, I get $500,000 at full value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation. Even if I managed to get a better split in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $500,000 to make up for the inflation loss.

For example, to match the current $500,000 value in the next round, I'd need to get $625,000 just to break even ($625,000 * 0.8 = $500,000).

A 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite fair, and the inflation risk makes it even more attractive to accept now.
