"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $600000 due to the potential inflation affecting me more significantly. This way, you still receive $400000 immediately. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * $1,000,000 Ã— 0.8 = $800,000 total value next round
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get more than $500,000 to beat current $400,000 value

Alice's offer isn't great, but the inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. If I reject, I'd need to secure a much larger portion next round just to break even, and Alice might reject my counter-offer.
