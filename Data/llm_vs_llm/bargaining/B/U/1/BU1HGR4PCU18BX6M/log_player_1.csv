"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers Bob's incentive to accept due to inflation. Since Bob loses 5% value per round, he has a reason to accept a smaller share sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation affects Bob more than me, so he has more incentive to accept now rather than waiting for future rounds."
