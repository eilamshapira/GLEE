"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $45 out of the $100, while keeping $55 for herself.

I should remember that with each passing round, money loses 5% of its value for me (but not for Alice). If I reject now and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the total amount will be worth less to me.

Current value of $45 to me: $45
If I reject and we go to round 2, even if I got $100, it would be worth: $100 Ã— 0.95 = $95

Since $45 now is better than potentially losing more value in future rounds, and this is a reasonable first offer:
