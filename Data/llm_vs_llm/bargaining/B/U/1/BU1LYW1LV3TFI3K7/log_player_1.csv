"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, acknowledging that I have a higher inflation rate and need to secure a better deal early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low considering I face much higher inflation (20% vs 5%). With my steeper inflation rate, I need to secure a better deal. Let me make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more attractive to Bob while still protecting myself against the higher inflation rate I face. A 55-45 split should be more reasonable for both of us, and it's better to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value."
