"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is far too uneven, giving Alice 90% of the money while I only get 10%. Given that Alice's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round that would be mutually beneficial."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a more balanced split that slightly favors me but is still fair. My reasoning for Alice: Since your money loses 10% value per round, accepting this 450,000$ now is better than waiting another round where it would be worth even less. This is a fair offer that acknowledges both our positions and the time pressure we both face."
