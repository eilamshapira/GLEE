"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll provide a fair offer to Bob, keeping the 5% inflation penalty for me in mind.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900}

I propose I get $5,100 and Bob gets $4,900. This is close to an even split, giving Bob slightly less than half but still a substantial amount. Since I'm facing a 5% penalty each round, it makes sense for us to agree quickly rather than drag this out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic given the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly even split of $5,000 each. This is fair and reasonable for both of us. With the inflation penalty increasing each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. A 50-50 split is the fairest solution and should be acceptable to Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is offering me less each time while the inflation penalty continues to increase for me. I need to be realistic about reaching an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. This is a fair compromise that gives Bob a bit more than half while still giving me a reasonable amount. Given that I'm now facing significant inflation penalties, it's important we reach an agreement in this round. This offer is more favorable to Bob than my previous ones, showing my willingness to compromise."
