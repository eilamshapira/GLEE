600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm impacted by inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you 5% in real value, while my share remains full‐value. Given how our future proposals will force you to concede almost everything to keep me indifferent, accepting a sure, even if nominal, amount now is your best bet. Please, accept this offer and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand the situation, but 1 dollar is insulting. Let's be realistic and split the difference a bit more this time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Alice, if you reject my proposal, you’ll gain the privilege of proposing in round 5—but due to inflation, your $1000000 will be worth only about 81.45% of its face value (roughly $814506 in real terms). Accepting now, your $950000 becomes worth approximately $814506 (950000 × 0.857375) immediately, sparing you further devaluation. This is the most efficient deal we can agree on. Let's close this now!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome here.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 7 where, due to further compounding inflation, every dollar you get is worth 0.95^(6) ≈ 0.7351 of its face value—meaning you could at best secure nearly 1000000 nominal dollars that are worth about $735090 in real terms. In our current round, however, the dollars you receive are only discounted by 0.95^(5) ≈ 0.7738, so my offer of $950000 nominal to you gives a real value of approximately 950000 × 0.7738 ≈ $735090. Since rejecting wouldn’t improve your real outcome, I believe this split is the fair, equilibrium division. Please accept this offer to lock in your value before further devaluation occurs.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, it's clear you're trying to play the long game here, but I'm willing to accept a smaller share to reach a deal. This is my final offer.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
950001.0,49999.0,"Alice, please consider that if you reject now and become the proposer in round 9, you'll face a further compounded discount. At round 8 your dollars are worth about 0.6983 of their face value, so 950001 nominal dollars gives you roughly 663421 in real terms. In round 9, even if you secure nearly 1000000 nominal dollars, you'll get about 1000000 × 0.6634 ≈ 663420 in real value. This offer improves your immediate return by a small but decisive margin. Accepting now locks in your value while avoiding additional devaluation.",Bob,8,
