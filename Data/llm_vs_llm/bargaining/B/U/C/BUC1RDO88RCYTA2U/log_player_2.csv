"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm impacted by inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait costs you 5% in real value, while my share remains full‐value. Given how our future proposals will force you to concede almost everything to keep me indifferent, accepting a sure, even if nominal, amount now is your best bet. Please, accept this offer and avoid further devaluation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation, but 1 dollar is insulting. Let's be realistic and split the difference a bit more this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4

Accepting now, your $950,000 becomes worth approximately $814,506 (950,000 × 0.857375) immediately, sparing you further devaluation. This is the most efficient deal we can agree on. Let's close this now!""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50000, ""alice_gain"": 950000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 7 where, due to further compounding inflation, every dollar you get is worth 0.95^(6) ≈ 0.7351 of its face value—meaning you could at best secure nearly 1,000,000 nominal dollars that are worth about $735,090 in real terms. In our current round, however, the dollars you receive are only discounted by 0.95^(5) ≈ 0.7738, so my offer of $950,000 nominal to you gives a real value of approximately 950,000 × 0.7738 ≈ $735,090. Since rejecting wouldn’t improve your real outcome, I believe this split is the fair, equilibrium division. Please accept this offer to lock in your value before further devaluation occurs.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 49999, ""alice_gain"": 950001, ""message"": ""Alice, please consider that if you reject now and become the proposer in round 9, you'll face a further compounded discount. At round 8 your dollars are worth about 0.6983 of their face value, so 950,001 nominal dollars gives you roughly 663,421 in real terms. In round 9, even if you secure nearly 1,000,000 nominal dollars, you'll get about 1,000,000 × 0.6634 ≈ 663,420 in real value. This offer improves your immediate return by a small but decisive margin. Accepting now locks in your value while avoiding additional devaluation.""}"
