"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go with a fair 50-50 split. We've already lost 10% to inflation, so further rounds will hurt both of us. This is equitable and gets us both a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
