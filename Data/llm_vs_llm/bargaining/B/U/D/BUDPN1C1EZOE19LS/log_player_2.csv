"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000. While this isn't an even split, I should keep in mind that inflation will reduce the value of money by 10% each round if I reject. If I counter-offer in the next round, the total value would be $900,000, and even if I got a better percentage, the absolute value might be lower.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation that's already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's go with a fair 50-50 split. We've already lost 10% to inflation, so further rounds will hurt both of us. This is equitable and gets us both a substantial amount.""}"
