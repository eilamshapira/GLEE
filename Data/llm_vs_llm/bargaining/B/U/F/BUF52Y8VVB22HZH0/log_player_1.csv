Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split this evenly. With inflation affecting both of us (especially me at 20% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This 50-50 split is the fairest solution and allows us both to walk away with a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
