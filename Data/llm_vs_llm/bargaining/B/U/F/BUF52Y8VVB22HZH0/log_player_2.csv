"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off on a good note. This offer gives me a bit more, but you'll still get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $30 while she gets $70. However, if I reject and we continue to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of money for both of us - 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice.

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me and $90 to Alice. 

Let me think about whether accepting $30 now is better than potentially negotiating for more in later rounds with inflation factored in.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fact that we have a limited number of rounds, I think I should counter-offer rather than accept this initial uneven split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this evenly. With inflation affecting both of us (especially me at 20% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This 50-50 split is the fairest solution and allows us both to walk away with a good outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but a 50/50 split isn't fair considering the rate discrepancy.  This offer still gives you a reasonable amount, and we need to settle this sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is now offering me $35 while taking $65 for herself. 

Due to inflation, my $35 is now worth only 64% of what it would have been in round 1, so that's equivalent to about $22.40 in round 1 value. Alice's $65 is worth 81% of round 1 value, so about $52.65 to her.

If I reject, we go to round 4, where inflation will reduce values further - my share would be worth just 51.2% of original value, and Alice's would be worth 72.9% of original value.

While the split isn't even, Alice makes a valid point about the inflation rate difference, and with my higher inflation rate, delaying further significantly hurts my position more than hers. Getting $35 now (even with the 36% reduction in value) is likely better than continuing to negotiate while my purchasing power rapidly decreases.
