Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we delay further you'll face even steeper losses due to depreciation. In round 3 you could secure nearly the full pie, but it would only be worth 64% of its nominal value. Accepting 8000$ now guarantees you an effective value of 6400$, which matches your best alternative. I believe this split is the only rational way to move on efficiently for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
