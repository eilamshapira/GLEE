"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, if we delay further you'll face even steeper losses due to depreciation. In round 3 you could secure nearly the full pie, but it would only be worth 64% of its nominal value. Accepting 8000$ now guarantees you an effective value of 6400$, which matches your best alternative. I believe this split is the only rational way to move on efficiently for both of us.""}"
