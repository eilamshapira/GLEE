"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the steep 20% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing we settle now. I’m offering you $6000 while I receive $4000. This early agreement spares us both delays, and I hope you agree that it’s a fair deal under the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, Alice. I'm willing to take a smaller cut this time to show good faith, but I'm sure you understand that I'm still concerned about the inflation penalty. Let's split it 70/30 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
