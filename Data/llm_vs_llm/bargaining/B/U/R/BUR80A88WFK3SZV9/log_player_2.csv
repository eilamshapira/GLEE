"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the steep 20% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing we settle now. I’m offering you $6000 while I receive $4000. This early agreement spares us both delays, and I hope you agree that it’s a fair deal under the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
