"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable proposal where I get 55% and Bob gets 45% of the total amount. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than waiting for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob offered me $4,750 which is worth full value to me ($4,750)
2. Bob wants $5,250, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $4,987.50 to him
3. This is slightly worse for me than my initial offer
4. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's inflation will be even higher
5. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances, and prolonging might lead to worse outcomes
