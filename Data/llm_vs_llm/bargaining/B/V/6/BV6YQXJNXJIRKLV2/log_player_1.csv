Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split of 55/45. This is fair considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly, and the money is still worth 95% of its original value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
