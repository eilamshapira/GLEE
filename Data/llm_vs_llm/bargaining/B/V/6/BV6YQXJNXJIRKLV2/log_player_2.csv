"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us while the stakes are still high. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't an even split, considering:
1. We're in the first round and the money is at full value
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% less value
3. I'll get a substantial amount ($400,000)
4. We need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds

However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even with the 5% decrease, I could propose a more equitable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still slightly in my favor since Alice tried to get a larger share first.

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split of 55/45. This is fair considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly, and the money is still worth 95% of its original value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but I need a bit more. Let's do 57.5/42.5.  We're losing money with every round! 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer...

Alice has moved from her initial 60/40 split to a 57.5/42.5 split, showing some willingness to negotiate. Under this offer, I would get:
- $425,000 * 0.9025 (due to 9.75% inflation) = $383,562.50 effective value

If I reject and we continue:
1. The next round will have even more inflation (14.5%)
2. We've already used 3 of our 12 rounds
3. Alice has shown she's willing to compromise
4. The difference between this and a 50/50 split is becoming less significant due to inflation

Given the mounting inflation pressure and the fact that Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, this seems like a reasonable point to accept.
