7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 70/30 split to get this over with quickly. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6900.0,3100.0,"Hi Alice, how about a 31/69 split? Considering that waiting further will reduce both our payoffs (especially yours, given the steeper discount rate), I believe this division is fair. I’d like to settle on this division in round 2—what do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Okay Bob, how about 65/35? We're both losing value with each round. Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Hi Alice, it's round 4. Considering that each passing round knocks a heavier discount on our shares – with mine at about 14.3% and yours at roughly 27.1% less than the initial value – I believe we should seal the deal now. I’m proposing that I get $4200 and you get $5800. This split reflects our respective discount rates and ensures you receive a timely, decent payoff. What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alright Bob, let's try this one last time. 55/45. If we don't agree now, it's going to keep getting worse for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Hi Alice, we're now at round 6 and the depreciation is really biting—my share is worth about 77.4% of the original value now, while yours is only worth about 59.0%. To avoid further losses and to secure a decent amount for both of us, I'm proposing $4700 for me and $5300 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise given the steep discount you're facing. Let's settle now rather than see our shares shrink even more.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is it. 50/50. We both get a fair share, and we both stop the bleeding. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
