Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about a 31/69 split? Considering that waiting further will reduce both our payoffs (especially yours, given the steeper discount rate), I believe this division is fair. I’d like to settle on this division in round 2—what do you say?

# Bob gain: 3100

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, it's round 4. Considering that each passing round knocks a heavier discount on our shares – with mine at about 14.3% and yours at roughly 27.1% less than the initial value – I believe we should seal the deal now. I’m proposing that I get $4200 and you get $5800. This split reflects our respective discount rates and ensures you receive a timely, decent payoff. What do you say?

# Bob gain: 4200

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're now at round 6 and the depreciation is really biting—my share is worth about 77.4% of the original value now, while yours is only worth about 59.0%. To avoid further losses and to secure a decent amount for both of us, I'm proposing $4700 for me and $5300 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise given the steep discount you're facing. Let's settle now rather than see our shares shrink even more.
