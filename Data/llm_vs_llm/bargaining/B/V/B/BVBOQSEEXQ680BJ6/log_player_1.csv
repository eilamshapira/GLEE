"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, keeping in mind the inflation and the limited rounds. I'll propose a split that favors me slightly in this early round, but still gives Bob a significant portion to make it appealing.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the current offer and the impact of inflation. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's offer:** $400,000 for me, $600,000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less. Bob's money is worth 10% less.

Considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get $400,000, which is worth $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 in the initial round's value. Bob would get $600,000, worth $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000 in the initial round's value.

I'll accept the offer.
