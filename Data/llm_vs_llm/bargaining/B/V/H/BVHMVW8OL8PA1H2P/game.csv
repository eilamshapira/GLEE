31.0,69.0,"Alice, waiting to propose in the next round costs you more due to the 10% discount, and I too lose value with a 5% drop. In this proposal, you get $31 – exactly what you’d expect by waiting – while I secure $69. Let’s avoid further devaluation and settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, my turn and time is money. This offer is still generous to you, considering the discounts. Let's wrap this up.",Alice,3,

54.0,46.0,"Alice, further delays will hurt us both. In this round, I’m offering you $54 while I take $46. Discounting makes every minute count—in round 4 your $54 is worth about $39.4 to you, which matches what you'd get by waiting, while my share is nearly identical in value. Let’s settle now and avoid more devaluation.",Bob,4,
