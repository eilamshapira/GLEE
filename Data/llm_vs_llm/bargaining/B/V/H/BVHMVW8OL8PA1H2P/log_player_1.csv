Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting to propose in the next round costs you more due to the 10% discount, and I too lose value with a 5% drop. In this proposal, you get $31 – exactly what you’d expect by waiting – while I secure $69. Let’s avoid further devaluation and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 31 
# Bob gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's analyze Bob's offer. He's using a bit of manipulation here, trying to make it seem like I have nothing to gain by waiting.  While it's true I face a higher discount, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. 

By rejecting, I put myself in a position to propose in the next round, where I can aim for a more equitable split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn and time is money. This offer is still generous to you, considering the discounts. Let's wrap this up."" 
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Accounting for Inflation:** I've adjusted my offer slightly downwards to account for the inflation both of us are facing.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm still aiming for a larger share than Bob, as I believe my willingness to wait gives me a slight edge. 
* **Urgency:**  My message emphasizes the time pressure, hoping Bob will be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delays will hurt us both. In this round, I’m offering you $54 while I take $46. Discounting makes every minute count—in round 4 your $54 is worth about $39.4 to you, which matches what you'd get by waiting, while my share is nearly identical in value. Let’s settle now and avoid more devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Bob is getting much closer to a reasonable split. While I could try to push for a tiny bit more, the inflation is working against me significantly now. Accepting his offer ensures I get a reasonable amount, even with the discount applied.  It's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting even less later."
