Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, 50/50. It's a fair start for both of us.

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""How about 55/45? It's closer to the middle ground than my previous offer, but still accounts for the time pressure.""

I am aiming for a slightly better outcome than a 50/50 split since I made the first move, but I am willing to compromise as time is a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's adjust the split to 48 for me and 52 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is better than what I expect to get if I keep rejecting and the money keeps depreciating. Bob is unlikely to offer more, and I risk getting even less if I continue playing."
