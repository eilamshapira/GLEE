Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, considering the inflation rates, let's find a middle ground. How about I take $45 and you take $55? This way, it seems a bit more balanced with the devaluation. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
