"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, if I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round.

Since I have the power to make the next offer if I reject, and there's a risk that Alice might reject a more favorable proposal from me (which could lead to a less favorable outcome in subsequent rounds), I'll accept this offer. $400,000 is a significant sum that I wouldn't want to risk losing.
