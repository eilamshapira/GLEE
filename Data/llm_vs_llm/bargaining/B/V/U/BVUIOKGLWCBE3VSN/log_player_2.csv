"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly and fairly. I'll take 6000, you get 4000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer seems unfair as it gives Alice a significantly larger share (60%) without any clear justification. Since this is just the first round and the inflation penalty is still minimal, I can afford to make a counter-proposal that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can conclude the deal quickly before inflation reduces our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Inflation is eating away at our money! I'll take 5500 and you get 4500. This is still a good deal for both of us compared to losing it all. Accept? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not perfectly equal, this offer is much more reasonable than the first one, and with inflation already reducing our gains by nearly 10%, it makes sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation. The difference between our shares is smaller, and the absolute value I'm getting (4500) even after inflation is still substantial."
