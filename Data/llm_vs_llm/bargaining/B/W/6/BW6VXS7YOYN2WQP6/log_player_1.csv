"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

My proposal to Bob: ""I suggest a nearly even split where I get $5,200 and you get $4,800. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a fair 50-50 split, and rejecting it would mean losing another 5% to inflation in the next round. There's also no guarantee that future negotiations would result in a better outcome.
