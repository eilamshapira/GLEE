"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob will accept, considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. If I ask for too much, Bob might reject and make a counterproposal next round, when my money would be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering myself $55 and Bob $45. This is slightly in my favor but still fair. Since I face 10% inflation each round and Bob doesn't, it's reasonable for me to seek a bit more now. If Bob rejects, I'd only get 90% of whatever we agree to next round, which incentivizes me to be reasonable now and Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because it's significantly in Bob's favor. Since I'm facing inflation pressure but Bob is not, he's trying to use that to his advantage by offering me less than an equal split. If I make a counteroffer in the next round, even with the 10% further inflation, I can still propose a more balanced distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that the money I receive is now worth 20% less due to inflation (10% per round), while Bob's portion maintains its value. I should propose a fair split considering this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering myself $60 and Bob $40. This compensates for the inflation I'm facing - the $60 is effectively worth $48 to me after the 20% inflation, which is close to an equal split. This proposal acknowledges the time pressure I'm under while still giving Bob a reasonable portion. Bob should recognize this is fair given the asymmetric inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because Bob is continuing to exploit the inflation pressure I'm under by offering me an even smaller portion than before. While my money is now worth 27.1% less, his offer of $30 (which would effectively be worth about $21.87 to me after inflation) is too low compared to a fair division. I believe I can still make a more balanced counteroffer in the next round that would be better for me despite the additional inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to carefully consider this offer given the increasing inflation pressure. After 4 rounds, the money I receive is now worth 30% less, so I need to account for that in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm offering myself $58 and Bob $42. With the 30% inflation I'm facing, the $58 is effectively worth about $40.60 to me, which is closer to a fair split considering our circumstances. This offer balances my need to compensate for inflation while still giving Bob a reasonable portion that he might accept. Further delays would only reduce the value of my share more, so I'm hoping Bob recognizes this as a reasonable compromise."
