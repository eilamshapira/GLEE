"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $45, keeping $55 for herself. If I reject this and move to the next round, Alice's value will decrease by 10% due to inflation, while mine stays the same. This means in the next round:

- I'll still value each dollar at $1
- Alice will value each dollar at $0.90

This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round, as Alice will be more willing to accept a lower amount. I could potentially propose a split more favorable to me.

Given this, I'll reject this initial offer to aim for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money is now worth 10% less to her, I can leverage this to get a better deal. If I offer her $50, it's only worth $45 to her now due to inflation, while still costing me $50. 

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is better than her initial offer. For Alice, getting $40 now (worth $36 to her due to inflation) might be better than risking another round where the money would be worth even less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me less ($40) than her initial offer ($45)
2. For Alice, the $60 she's asking for is actually worth only $48.60 to her due to 19% inflation
3. If I reject this, in the next round:
   - Alice's money will be worth 29% less
   - I can still make an offer where Alice gets even less real value
4. However, there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down if we keep going

Given that this offer is worse for me than the initial offer ($40 vs $45), and I still have leverage due to inflation affecting Alice but not me, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Alice's money is worth 29% less to her due to inflation, while my value remains the same. This significantly strengthens my bargaining position.

If I offer Alice $45, it's only worth $31.95 to her due to inflation (45 * 0.71). This is actually less real value than what my previous offer of $40 would have been worth to her in the last round.

I'll propose a more aggressive 70-30 split, as Alice should be motivated to accept to avoid further devaluation of her share:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose this 70-30 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me $42, which is:
   - Better than her last offer ($40)
   - Still worse than her initial offer ($45)
2. For Alice, her $58 is now worth only about $38.05 (due to 34.39% inflation)
3. If I reject this, in the next round:
   - Alice's money will be worth about 44.39% less
   - Further negotiations might lead to a worse outcome for both

While I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, the risk of continued rejection and the possibility of no deal starts to outweigh the potential benefits. Alice has shown she's willing to reject aggressive offers, and her slight increase in my share suggests some willingness to compromise.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer to secure a guaranteed $42.
