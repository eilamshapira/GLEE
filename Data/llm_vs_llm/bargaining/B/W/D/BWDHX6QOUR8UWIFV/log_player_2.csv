"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me only 10% of the total amount ($1,000 out of $10,000)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round, while I don't face any devaluation
4. This gives me negotiating leverage since waiting is more costly for Alice than for me
5. With such a small initial offer, I should reject and propose a more balanced split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll propose a more balanced split while considering our relative positions:

1. Alice faces 10% devaluation per round, while I don't
2. This means Alice has more incentive to accept a fair offer now
3. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection
4. A reasonable split would be giving me slightly more than half, given my stronger position

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair offer considering:
- It's a more equitable distribution than Alice's initial offer
- It accounts for my stronger negotiating position (no devaluation)
- It still leaves Alice with a substantial amount that's worth accepting now rather than risking further devaluation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has increased my share from $1,000 to $1,900, but it's still only 19% of the total
2. For Alice, her $8,100 is actually worth less due to the 19% inflation she faces
3. Her $8,100 is effectively worth only about $6,561 to her now
4. I still have strong negotiating power because:
   - I face no devaluation
   - We still have 9 rounds left
   - Alice's money will continue to devalue by 10% each round
5. This offer is still too low given my position

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I should reject and wait for a more favorable offer, as my position gets stronger with each round due to Alice's inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Alice has already faced 19% devaluation
2. If she rejects this offer, she'll face even more devaluation in the next round
3. My previous offer of 60-40 was rejected
4. Given that Alice's negotiating position has weakened, I can increase my share
5. However, I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This offer is reasonable because:
- For Alice, getting $3,000 now is better than risking further devaluation
- Given her 19% devaluation, $3,000 is worth about $2,430 to her now
- If she waits more rounds, her share will be worth even less
- The offer reflects my stronger negotiating position while still giving Alice a meaningful amount"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2710 
# Alice gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased my share to $2,710 (27.1% of total)
2. For Alice, her $7,290 is worth only about $4,783 due to 34.39% inflation
3. We still have 7 rounds left
4. My negotiating position continues to strengthen because:
   - I still face no devaluation
   - Alice's money keeps devaluing by 10% each round
   - The gap between our effective gains keeps widening
5. While Alice is offering more, it's still not reflective of our relative positions

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
- The split is still too favorable to Alice
- My position gets stronger each round
- Alice's increasing offers show she's feeling pressure from the devaluation
- I can likely get a better deal in subsequent rounds"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the current situation:

1. Alice has now faced 34.39% devaluation
2. She's shown willingness to increase my share (from 1000 to 2710)
3. Her position is significantly weaker now
4. If she rejects, she'll face even more devaluation
5. I need to make an offer that's difficult to reject given her weakened position

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

This offer is strategic because:
- For Alice, $2,500 now is worth about $1,640 after her current devaluation
- If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less due to additional 10% devaluation
- We're halfway through the rounds, increasing pressure to reach an agreement
- The offer reflects my much stronger negotiating position
- It's still better for her to accept this now than to risk further devaluation and potentially worse offers"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3439 
# Alice gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased my share to $3,439 (34.39% of total)
2. For Alice, her $6,561 is worth only about $3,486 due to 46.86% inflation
3. We have 5 rounds left
4. Alice's consecutive increases in offers (1000 → 1900 → 2710 → 3439) show she's under significant pressure
5. Her money is now worth less than half its original value
6. My position continues to strengthen dramatically

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject because:
- While Alice keeps increasing my share, the split still doesn't reflect my extremely strong negotiating position
- Her money is rapidly losing value (nearly 50% already)
- She's showing clear patterns of increasing concessions
- With 5 rounds left and her facing another 10% devaluation each round, I can likely get a much better deal
- At this rate of concession, waiting is likely to be profitable for me"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the current situation:

1. Alice has now faced 46.86% devaluation - her money is worth less than half its original value
2. She's been steadily increasing my share, showing increasing desperation
3. Only 4 rounds remain after this one
4. The threat of getting nothing (if we reach round 12) is becoming more real
5. I need to make an offer that strongly incentivizes acceptance while maximizing my gain

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

This offer is strategic because:
- For Alice, $2,000 now is worth only about $1,063 after her current devaluation
- However, this is still better than risking:
  - Further 10% devaluation each round
  - Potentially worse offers
  - The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12
- We're entering the final third of negotiations
- My position is extremely strong
- The rapidly decreasing value of money for Alice makes accepting a smaller amount now more rational than hoping for more later"
