"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage while still providing Bob with a substantial sum. Since I'm making the first move, this reasonable split shows good faith while maintaining a strategic position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because I know I can still get a better deal. The money is worth less to Bob now due to inflation, so I can use this to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round. The offer gives me less than my initial proposal, and since I'm not affected by inflation, I have a stronger negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a split where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. Since Bob's money is decreasing in value due to inflation (now worth 5% less than round 1), this offer actually gives Bob a fair value while maximizing my position. The faster we reach an agreement, the more valuable Bob's share will be, so this should encourage a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Given that Bob's money is now worth 14.26% less due to inflation, a 50-50 split actually favors me, but I can do better. Bob's bargaining position is weakening with each round due to inflation, while my value remains stable. I can propose a more advantageous split in the next round, as Bob should be increasingly motivated to reach a deal before their share loses more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose a split where I get $650,000 and Bob gets $350,000. With Bob's money now worth over 14% less due to inflation, this offer is becoming more reasonable for both parties. Bob should consider accepting this offer quickly because their share will continue to decrease in value with each round, while my share maintains its value. This split reflects our different positions regarding inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's money now worth 22.62% less than in round 1, their $475,000 offer is actually only worth about $367,555 in round 1 terms. Meanwhile, my $525,000 maintains its full value. Given that I can still make counter-offers and my money isn't affected by inflation, I have a stronger position to negotiate for a better deal. The increasing inflation effect on Bob's share should make them more willing to accept a more favorable split for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a split where I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. With Bob's money now worth over 22% less due to inflation, this offer of $300,000 to Bob is becoming more urgent for them to accept. The real value of Bob's share will continue to decrease with each round, while my share maintains its value. Given that we're now in round 7 of 12, and Bob's money is rapidly losing value, this offer provides a reasonable opportunity to conclude the negotiation before Bob's position weakens further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's share now worth 30.17% less than in round 1, their $450,000 is actually only worth about $314,235 in round 1 value. Meanwhile, my offered $550,000 maintains its full value. We're now two-thirds through the negotiation (round 8 of 12), and Bob's position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation. I can still push for a better deal, especially since my money retains its full value. I expect Bob will need to make a more favorable offer soon to avoid even greater losses from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I propose a split where I get $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. With Bob's money now worth over 30% less due to inflation, time is becoming critical. We only have 4 rounds left, and Bob's share continues to lose value while mine stays stable. This $250,000 for Bob, while appearing small, is actually a better deal for them than waiting longer and receiving a larger nominal amount that would be worth even less due to increasing inflation. Given the limited remaining rounds and the accelerating inflation effect, this offer represents a reasonable opportunity to conclude our negotiation before Bob's position deteriorates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's $400,000 now worth 36.98% less, their share is actually only worth about $252,080 in round 1 value, while my $600,000 maintains its full value. We're now in round 10 of 12, with only two rounds remaining. Given that Bob's money continues to rapidly lose value and we're approaching the deadline where we both get nothing, I maintain a strong negotiating position. I can push for an even better deal in the next round, as Bob should be increasingly desperate to avoid both the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose a split where I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. This is the second-to-last round, and we must reach an agreement by the next round or we both get nothing. Bob's money has lost nearly 37% of its value due to inflation, and this trend will continue in the final round. While $200,000 might seem low, it's better for Bob to accept this now than to risk getting nothing in the final round or receiving a larger nominal amount that would be worth even less due to inflation. Given our rapidly approaching deadline and the severe inflation impact on Bob's share, this offer represents the last good opportunity to secure a deal before we both risk walking away with nothing."
