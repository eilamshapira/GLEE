"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value was $100. Now, for me, it's $100 * 0.95 = $95, and for Alice, it's $100 * 0.8 = $80.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value due to inflation, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

For me, the original $100 is now worth $100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $90.25, and for Alice, it's $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64.

Alice's offer gives me $28, which is approximately 31% of the original $100, but considering the inflation, it's a larger percentage of the decreased total value for me.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems reasonable given the circumstances.
