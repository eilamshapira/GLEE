"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. 

If I reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $100 total will effectively be worth only $80 to me. Even if I were to get all $80, that's less valuable than getting $45 now.

Given the inflation penalty and the fairly reasonable split Alice is offering (45/55), I should accept this offer.
