"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take 60$ and give Bob 40$. This is a fair split considering I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty per round if we don't agree now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 10% inflation penalty in the next round, I can still propose a better split for myself in round 3. The current offer would give me $40, but in the next round, I can propose a split that would give me more than that even after the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing in this round, my $55 is actually worth $44 to me. This is slightly better than accepting Bob's previous offer of $40, and it gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal, so he might be more inclined to accept."
