"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this split reflects my contributions better. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out and this offer still benefits us both. Don't be greedy.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:**  Each round that passes makes the money worth less. It's essential to push Bob towards a deal.
- **Concession:** I've made a small concession from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate but not to be taken advantage of.
- **Framing:**  By calling out ""greed,"" I'm subtly playing on the fear of losing a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair compromise given the situation. Let's secure some funds for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is now offering more than he would have received in his initial offer (due to inflation making his share less appealing),  he's still trying to take a larger portion than my last offer.  Time pressure is mounting, but accepting now sets a bad precedent and could encourage Bob to hold out for even less in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising again. This is a fair deal, let's close this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, signaling flexibility while still aiming for a larger share.
- **Urgency:** Emphasizing the time constraint and potential for mutual loss if we don't reach an agreement soon.
- **Finality:** Presenting this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer to add pressure and discourage further haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the declining value, this offer ensures we both get a decent amount. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and trying to frame his offer as generous due to the declining value. However, he's still asking for more than what he would have received in the previous round after accounting for inflation.  I need to hold firm and make him realize time is running out for him too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 570000,
""bob_gain"": 430000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time and this is the best you'll get.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Firm Stance:**  It's time to be completely clear that I won't be pushed further. This offer is a slight concession on my part, but presented as non-negotiable. 
- **Urgency Reinforced:**  Again highlighting the diminishing returns with each passing round. 
- **Slight Concession:** I'm offering a little more than Bob's last proposal, making it harder for him to refuse without seeming completely unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair, even split considering the current situation. Let's not risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally moved to a 50/50 split. While I believe I had a stronger bargaining position, the effects of inflation are becoming severe. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to bargain risks losing everything if we fail to reach an agreement."
