"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get 60$ and you get 40$. This way we can both benefit without dragging this into future rounds where inflation will reduce the money's value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think we should aim for a more equal split. I'm willing to take a bit more, but still leave you with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer now:
   * I get $45, but with 20% inflation = $36 effective value
   * Bob gets $55 with only 5% inflation = $52.25 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less for me (another 20% drop)
   * Any amount I get will be significantly devalued
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of further devaluation, I should accept this offer now. While it's not ideal, waiting longer will likely result in worse outcomes for me due to the asymmetric inflation rates.
