"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting 4000$ now is better than potentially getting more in a later round, considering the inflation of 20% per round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be 8000$ (10000$ with 20% inflation). So if I can secure more than 4000$ in my counter-offer, and Alice accepts, I'd be better off rejecting now.

Since Alice seems to be asking for more than half despite the fact that inflation only affects me, I think I should make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation that affects only me. Since the money is worth 20% less to me this round, a fair split would give me a bit more to compensate.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing this split because it accounts for the inflation penalty I face. With 20% inflation, the $10,000 is effectively worth $8,000 to me now, so a 55/45 split gives us roughly equal value considering the inflation disadvantage I have."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer given the increasing inflation.

With 36% inflation now, the $10,000 pot is effectively worth only $6,400 to me. Alice is offering me $4,500, which is better than her first offer, but still less than half of the original amount.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face 48% inflation (20% more), making the pot worth only $5,200 to me. To beat the current offer of $4,500, I would need Alice to accept an offer giving me significantly more, which seems unlikely given her behavior so far.

Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,500, showing some willingness to negotiate. Given the accelerating inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, I should accept this improved offer.
