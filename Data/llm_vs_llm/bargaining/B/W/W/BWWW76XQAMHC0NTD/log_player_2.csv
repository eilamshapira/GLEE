"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk. I'm offering you $4500. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. $4500 in this round is better than $5000 in the next round (which would be worth $4000 due to inflation)
4. While I could counter-offer, there's risk in prolonging negotiations due to the inflation effect

This is actually a reasonable first offer considering:
- It's not too far from a 50-50 split
- The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me
- We have limited rounds, so prolonged negotiation is risky
