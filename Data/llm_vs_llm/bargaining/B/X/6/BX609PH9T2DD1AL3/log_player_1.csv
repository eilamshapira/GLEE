Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, and two rounds have passed, the total decrease in value is 10%. However, the actual amount to be divided is still $10,000, but its value is now 90% of the original.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the decreased value. 

My offer is: 
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
