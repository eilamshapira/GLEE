"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a slightly bigger share, but you still get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45, which is close to a 50-50 split
2. There's no inflation impact on my side
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of getting a worse deal later
4. It's a reasonable first offer, showing Alice is willing to be fairly equitable

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While I could try to get more, $45 is a good outcome and avoiding the risk of a worse outcome or potential deadlock is worth it.
