"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since I know there's 20% inflation penalty for me each round but not for Bob, I should make a reasonably generous first offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000, which is a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because while I get a bit more, it's not an extreme split, and Bob should consider that if he rejects, the total value will be worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept $4,500 now, it's actually worth only $3,600 to me (4500 * 0.8)

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth another 20% less to me (only 64% of original value)
- I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
- After multiple rejections, my gains could become very small due to compounding inflation

3. The current offer gives me effectively $3,600 in value, which is not great but still substantial

4. The risk of getting even less in future rounds due to inflation is significant

Given these factors, I will accept this offer. While not ideal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating.
