"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split carefully. While it seems fair on the surface, I should account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will only be 9,500 instead of 10,000.

If I accept now, I get $5,000. If I reject and try to negotiate for more next round, I'd need to secure more than 5,263 (5,000 รท 0.95) to come out ahead after inflation.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and inflation impacts me each time, accepting this fair initial offer seems reasonable.
