"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I propose to keep 90% of the money, giving Bob only 10%. While it may seem aggressive, I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential for inflation. I'm open to negotiation, but I want to secure the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
