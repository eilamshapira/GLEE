"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for herself, which is a 10%-90% split in her favor. This is quite uneven.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, I need to consider that inflation reduces the value of money each round - 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I have some advantage in later rounds since Alice's money loses value faster than mine. This suggests I should reject this initial low offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer that better reflects our relative positions.

Given that Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round) compared to my 10%, I'll propose a more balanced split that takes this asymmetry into account.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally - $500,000 for each of us. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with significant value before inflation erodes it further. Given the inflation difference, it's in both our interests to reach agreement sooner rather than later, but especially for Alice."
