520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 1 I propose we split the $1000000 so that I receive $520000 and you receive $480000. Given that your share depreciates 5% each round while mine holds steady, I believe accepting this offer now secures a better outcome for you than waiting. Let's settle quickly and both benefit from the full value of the money!",Alice,1,
