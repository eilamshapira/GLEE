"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 1 I propose we split the $1000000 so that I receive $520000 and you receive $480000. Given that your share depreciates 5% each round while mine holds steady, I believe accepting this offer now secures a better outcome for you than waiting. Let's settle quickly and both benefit from the full value of the money! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $480,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me
   * Maximum I could get next round would be worth: $950,000 (if I propose keeping most)
   * But Alice would likely reject that, leading to more rounds and depreciation

Alice's reasoning about depreciation is valid. If we continue to later rounds, my share will keep losing value while hers won't. While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $480,000 now is better than risking further depreciation in future rounds.

This is actually a pretty fair offer considering the asymmetric depreciation factor.
