Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical - we're both losing money to inflation with each round. I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with equal amounts and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
