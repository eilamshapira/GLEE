"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, neither of us feels disadvantaged. I think it's a reasonable offer for both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
