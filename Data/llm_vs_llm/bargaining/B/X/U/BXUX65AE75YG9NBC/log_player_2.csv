"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, giving us each $50. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me.

If I reject, in the next round the total value to me would be only $90 (due to 10% inflation from my perspective), while still being $100 from Alice's perspective.

Since this initial offer gives me half of the full value without any depreciation, it's actually a reasonable offer.
