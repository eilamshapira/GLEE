"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that with each round my portion loses value while yours remains intact, if you reject my offer you’ll have the opportunity to propose next and secure the full amount anyway. Therefore, I’m offering you the entire $10,000 now. Please accept this division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges the time pressure while still offering you a significant portion. This ensures we both benefit rather than risking everything. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I find your proposal in round 2 acceptable given the diminishing value of my share with every round. Let's proceed with the division as proposed.""}"
