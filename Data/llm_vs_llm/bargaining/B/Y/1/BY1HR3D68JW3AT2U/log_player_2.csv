"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that with each round my portion loses value while yours remains intact, if you reject my offer you’ll have the opportunity to propose next and secure the full amount anyway. Therefore, I’m offering you the entire $10000 now. Please accept this division. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use a manipulative tactic, suggesting I'll get the full amount if I reject. However, this assumes I'm only interested in maximizing my own gain and have no regard for fairness or reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to negotiate for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges the time pressure while still offering you a significant portion. This ensures we both benefit rather than risking everything.""
