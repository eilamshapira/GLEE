"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind I want to be fair but also secure a good portion for myself considering the time constraint and potential for loss due to inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself (55/45) but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount. This gives him a good incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation in later rounds."
