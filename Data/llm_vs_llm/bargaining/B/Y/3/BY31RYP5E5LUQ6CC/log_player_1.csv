"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

Given that the money is worth 10% less to me each round, I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob is likely to accept. It's better to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to inflation affecting my share.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split where I get slightly more, but Bob still receives a substantial amount. The 55/45 split acknowledges the time pressure I face due to inflation while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept rather than move to another round."
