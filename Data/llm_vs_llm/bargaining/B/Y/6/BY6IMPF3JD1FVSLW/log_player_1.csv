"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split as it gives Bob a significant portion while securing a favorable amount for myself. If Bob rejects and we move to the next round, my potential gains would be reduced by 10% due to inflation, so it's in my interest to make a compelling initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept this offer now, I'll get $50, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $45 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to compounding inflation
- Even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation of my share

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer. Getting $45 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.
