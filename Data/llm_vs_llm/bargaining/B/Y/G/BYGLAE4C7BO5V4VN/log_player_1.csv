"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider that my money is now worth less due to inflation, while Bob's is still worth the same. Also, I need to consider that if I reject, the next round I'll be the one making the offer, and if I don't get a good offer, it will only get worse.

Given this information, and the fact that I want to secure a portion of the money:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
