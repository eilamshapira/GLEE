100.0,0.0,"Bob, notice that with each round your money loses 5% of its value while mine isn’t discounted at all. If we delay, you only lose more. Since you’d be worse off by waiting, I propose that I take the full $100 now. Accept this offer to avoid further loss.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was completely one-sided. While I understand that inflation affects my share, a fair division would still give me a substantial portion. I'm offering you $40, which is quite generous considering we started with an equal claim to the money. If you reject and we go to round 3, inflation will reduce my $60 to $57, but your counteroffer would need to be very generous to make me accept. Let's settle this reasonably now.",Bob,2,

99.0,1.0,"Bob, consider that if we delay further, your share will drop even more due to inflation – in the next round you'd lose 15% of its value. My offer gives you $1 now (effectively 0.90$), which is better than what you can expect later. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, your $1 offer was still extremely unfair. I'm making a reasonable proposal that accounts for the inflation effect. With this 55-45 split, we both get a substantial portion. If we continue to the next round, my share would be worth about 15% less than the original value, but your counteroffer would need to be significantly better than $1 to make me accept. Let's end this game with a fair division that acknowledges both our positions.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your insistence on a fair division. However, every additional round further erodes the value of your share—in round 6, your dollars will be discounted even more. In light of this, I propose we settle in round 5: you receive $48 and I receive $52. This offer strikes a balanced compromise given the inflation penalty you'll face if we delay any longer. Please, let's conclude this now and avoid further loss.",Alice,5,
