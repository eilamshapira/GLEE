"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, notice that with each round your money loses 5% of its value while mine isn’t discounted at all. If we delay, you only lose more. Since you’d be worse off by waiting, I propose that I take the full $100 now. Accept this offer to avoid further loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was completely one-sided. While I understand that inflation affects my share, a fair division would still give me a substantial portion. I'm offering you $40, which is quite generous considering we started with an equal claim to the money. If you reject and we go to round 3, inflation will reduce my $60 to $57, but your counteroffer would need to be very generous to make me accept. Let's settle this reasonably now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, consider that if we delay further, your share will drop even more due to inflation – in the next round you'd lose 15% of its value. My offer gives you $1 now (effectively 0.90$), which is better than what you can expect later. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your $1 offer was still extremely unfair. I'm making a reasonable proposal that accounts for the inflation effect. With this 55-45 split, we both get a substantial portion. If we continue to the next round, my share would be worth about 15% less than the original value, but your counteroffer would need to be significantly better than $1 to make me accept. Let's end this game with a fair division that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your insistence on a fair division. However, every additional round further erodes the value of your share—in round 6, your dollars will be discounted even more. In light of this, I propose we settle in round 5: you receive $48 and I receive $52. This offer strikes a balanced compromise given the inflation penalty you'll face if we delay any longer. Please, let's conclude this now and avoid further loss.""}"
