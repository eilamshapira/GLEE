"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, notice that with each round your money loses 5% of its value while mine isn’t discounted at all. If we delay, you only lose more. Since you’d be worse off by waiting, I propose that I take the full $100 now. Accept this offer to avoid further loss. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is extremely one-sided, giving her all $100 and me nothing. While it's true that inflation affects my share by 5% each round, rejecting this completely unfair offer is still better. Even with the 5% inflation, I would have an opportunity to make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair and strategic counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation factor while seeking a reasonable distribution.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was completely one-sided. While I understand that inflation affects my share, a fair division would still give me a substantial portion. I'm offering you $40, which is quite generous considering we started with an equal claim to the money. If you reject and we go to round 3, inflation will reduce my $60 to $57, but your counteroffer would need to be very generous to make me accept. Let's settle this reasonably now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider that if we delay further, your share will drop even more due to inflation – in the next round you'd lose 15% of its value. My offer gives you $1 now (effectively 0.90$), which is better than what you can expect later. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still extremely one-sided, giving me only $1 of the $100. Even with inflation affecting my share, this is an unfair proposal. If I reject, I'll be able to make another offer in the next round. While my money would be worth 15% less in round 5, I could still propose a much more reasonable split than accepting just $1 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, your $1 offer was still extremely unfair. I'm making a reasonable proposal that accounts for the inflation effect. With this 55-45 split, we both get a substantial portion. If we continue to the next round, my share would be worth about 15% less than the original value, but your counteroffer would need to be significantly better than $1 to make me accept. Let's end this game with a fair division that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your insistence on a fair division. However, every additional round further erodes the value of your share—in round 6, your dollars will be discounted even more. In light of this, I propose we settle in round 5: you receive $48 and I receive $52. This offer strikes a balanced compromise given the inflation penalty you'll face if we delay any longer. Please, let's conclude this now and avoid further loss. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer has become much more reasonable. She's now offering me $48 while taking $52, which is close to an even split. Considering the inflation factor (my $48 is effectively worth about $39.10 due to the 18.55% inflation), and the fact that continuing would further reduce the value of my share, this is a fair compromise.
