"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 999,000/1,000 split.  It's a big advantage for me, but I'm willing to give Bob something to start. I expect him to counter.  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to take a larger share, but offer him enough to avoid being rejected again.  We are both losing money, but I need to get a better deal than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but given the inflation, I'm going to accept this. I'm losing a lot of money, but it's better than nothing and keeps me from losing more."
