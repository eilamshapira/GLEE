"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

I propose that I (Bob) receive $850,000 and Alice receives $150,000. Given the 5% inflation penalty that Alice faces each round, it's in her interest to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives her a substantial amount while recognizing my bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose that I (Bob) receive $800,000 and Alice receives $200,000. Alice, this is a fair offer considering that inflation is reducing the value of your share with each round. Your $200,000 now is worth more than a potentially larger amount in future rounds due to the 5% inflation penalty you face per round. Let's reach an agreement now."
