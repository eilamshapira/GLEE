500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I think a fair 50-50 split would be best for both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount and neither of us has to risk getting less in future rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more appropriate given the strategic advantage of going second. However, I'm open to negotiation in future rounds if you reject this offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about strategic positioning, but that works both ways now that we're in round 3. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which acknowledges the advantage of making this offer while still being fair. If we continue to future rounds, I may need to ask for more as the strategic dynamics shift further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I see that you're starting to understand the strategic advantage of making the offer. However, I still believe a split in my favor is more appropriate. Let's settle on a 70-30 split. If we continue, the stakes will keep increasing, and future offers might be less favorable to you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I notice you're escalating your demands rather than moving toward a fair compromise. This is round 5, and I now have the proposal advantage. My offer of 60-40 in my favor reflects this reality while still being reasonable. If you reject this, I'll need to increase my portion significantly in future rounds as the strategic advantage increases with each round. Let's end this productively rather than entering a spiral of diminishing returns for both of us.",Alice,5,
