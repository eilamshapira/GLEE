Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more appropriate given the strategic advantage of going second. However, I'm open to negotiation in future rounds if you reject this offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is round 5, and I now have the proposal advantage. My offer of 60-40 in my favor reflects this reality while still being reasonable. If you reject this, I'll need to increase my portion significantly in future rounds as the strategic advantage increases with each round. Let's end this productively rather than entering a spiral of diminishing returns for both of us.""}"
