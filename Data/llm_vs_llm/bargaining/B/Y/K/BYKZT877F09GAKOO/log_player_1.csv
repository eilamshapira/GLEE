"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split considering the devaluation. Let's be reasonable and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject because I can make a better offer in the next round. Since Bob faces 20% devaluation per round, his bargaining position weakens, while mine stays the same. I can propose a more favorable split for myself in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Due to the 40% total devaluation you now face, this $30 is only worth $18 to you. If you reject, the next round will reduce your value by another 20%. It's in your best interest to accept now.""}"
