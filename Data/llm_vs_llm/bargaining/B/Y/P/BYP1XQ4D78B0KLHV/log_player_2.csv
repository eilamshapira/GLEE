"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total.

Given that inflation doesn't affect me (0%), my $4,000 keeps its full value regardless of how many rounds we go. However, Alice faces 5% inflation per round, meaning her money loses value if we continue.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could potentially get a better deal since Alice would be more incentivized to accept due to inflation affecting her portion.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation pressure on Alice. Since her money loses 5% value each round, I can propose a slightly better deal for myself while still making it rational for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500, Alice. This is a fair offer considering that if we continue to another round, the 5% inflation will reduce the value of your portion. It makes economic sense for both of us to conclude the negotiation now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer in round 3. She's proposing I get $4,300 while she gets $5,700.

Looking at the situation:
- My $4,300 retains full value as I'm not affected by inflation
- Alice is now facing 9.75% inflation on her portion
- If we continue to another round, her inflation penalty will increase further

Since her offer is better than her initial $4,000 offer, but still less than what I proposed ($5,500), I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.

If I reject, I could propose a higher amount in round 4, and Alice would be under even more inflation pressure. However, there's no guarantee she'll accept, and we could end up in multiple more rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the increasing inflation pressure on Alice while still improving my position. Since her money is now worth almost 10% less and will decline further if we continue, I can propose a deal that gives her incentive to accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

Alice, I'm offering you $4,000. Consider that with the current inflation of 9.75% affecting your portion, and the additional 5% inflation you'll face if we go to another round, accepting this offer now is economically rational. The total amount remains fair given the inflation constraints you're facing."
