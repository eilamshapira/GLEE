"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, considering the inflation and the limited rounds. I'll start with a slight advantage for myself, but not too greedy, to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My proposal: A slight advantage for Alice to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offered a 50/50 split. My money is worth 5% less. I need to decide if it's better to take this now or risk another round. Let's calculate what 50 is worth to me now.

50 * 0.95 = 47.5

If I reject, I risk a worse offer next round, and further inflation. A 50/50 split at this stage isn't terrible.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
