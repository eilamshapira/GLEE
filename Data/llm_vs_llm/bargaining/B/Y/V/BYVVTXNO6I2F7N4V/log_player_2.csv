"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000. If I reject, I'll make an offer in the next round, but due to 20% inflation, the total value to me will be reduced to $800,000 equivalent. That means even if I got all of it (which Alice wouldn't accept), I'd only receive value equivalent to $800,000.

Given this inflation penalty, getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less in the next round.
