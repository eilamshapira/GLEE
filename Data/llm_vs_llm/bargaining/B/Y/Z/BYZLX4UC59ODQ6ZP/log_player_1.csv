"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the effect of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for inflation. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Let's calculate the actual value I'd get:
475000 * 0.95 = 451250

This is the value I'd get if I accept Bob's offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

My response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, which was already 5% less than the initial value. So, the total inflation factor for me is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Let's make an offer that takes this into account. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""My turn to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game. The actual value I'd get, considering the inflation, would be:
525000 * 0.9025 = 473381.25

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking a toll. Let's end this soon. 
# Alice gain: 447500 
# Bob gain: 552500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Let's calculate the actual value I'd get:
447500 * (1 - 0.1426) = 447500 * 0.8574 = 383911.3

This is the value I'd get if I accept Bob's offer.

Considering the significant impact of inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money.

My response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
