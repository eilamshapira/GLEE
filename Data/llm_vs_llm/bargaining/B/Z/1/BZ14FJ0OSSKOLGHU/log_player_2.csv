"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation loss. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. In round 2, even if I propose a better split, the maximum I could get would be $8,000 but with 20% inflation, making it effectively $6,400
4. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds and more inflation

Given that:
- $4,000 now is better than potentially nothing if we can't agree
- Future rounds will reduce my purchasing power
- This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant portion
