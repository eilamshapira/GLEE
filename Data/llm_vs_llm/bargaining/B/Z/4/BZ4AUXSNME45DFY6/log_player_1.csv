"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced, considering the decreasing value 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* In round 1, I offered myself $60
* Now Bob offers me $45, but with 10% inflation, this is actually worth $40.50 to me
* If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth 20% less than original value
* So I'd need to get at least $50.63 in the next round to equal what I can get now ($40.50)
* That might be hard to negotiate, and further delays will reduce value even more
