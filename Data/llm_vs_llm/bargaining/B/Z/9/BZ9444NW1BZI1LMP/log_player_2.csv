"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I (Bob) know that:

1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. The money devalues more quickly for me (10%) than for Alice (5%)
3. If I reject, my $50 would become worth $45 next round, while Alice's $50 would become worth $47.50

Given that the money loses value faster for me, and this is a perfectly fair initial offer, it would be risky to reject and try to negotiate for more.
