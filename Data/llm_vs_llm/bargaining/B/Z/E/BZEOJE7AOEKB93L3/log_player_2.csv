"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer:

Alice offers me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself.

Since there's no inflation for me between rounds, I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. However, Alice faces 10% inflation per round, which gives me some leverage. If we go to Round 2, I can make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me.

Given that I can likely secure a better deal in the next round (since Alice would be facing inflation), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't lose value.

Since we're in Round 2, if Alice rejects my offer, we'll move to Round 3 where the money will be worth 10% less to her. I should leverage this to make an offer that's better for me while still being rational for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable because if Alice rejects and we move to Round 3, the $100 will only be worth $90 to her. My offer gives her $40 now, which is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to her inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer:

Alice is now offering me $50 out of $100, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $45.

Important considerations:
- I don't face any inflation, so $50 is worth full value to me
- Alice now faces 19% inflation, meaning each dollar is worth less to her
- If I reject, we'll move to Round 4 where I can make an offer, but Alice will face even more inflation (around 27%)

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round given that Alice's inflation penalty increases. The fact that she's willing to move to a 50-50 split shows she's concerned about the inflation effect.

Given my strong negotiating position due to Alice's inflation penalty, I'll reject this offer to seek an even better split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer for Round 4, considering that Alice now faces approximately 27% inflation (10% more than in Round 3).

Given Alice's increasing inflation penalty, she should be more willing to accept a less favorable split now rather than risk further inflation in the next round. If she rejects my offer, we'll move to Round 5 where the money will be worth about 35% less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor. This is rational for Alice to accept because:
1. $30 now for Alice is worth more than potentially getting a larger number that's heavily discounted by inflation in future rounds
2. If she rejects, we go to Round 5 where the $100 would only be worth about $65 to her due to inflation
3. Even if she countered with a more favorable offer to herself in Round 5, I could reject it knowing that her inflation penalty continues to worsen

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my gain while still being acceptable to Alice given her inflation disadvantage."
