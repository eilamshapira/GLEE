750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, I propose I take $750000 and you take $250000. This is fair because inflation affects you more severely than me (20% vs 5% per round). If we delay, we both lose value. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation impacts.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I understand the inflation disparity, but let's be reasonable. This offer provides a fairer split while still acknowledging the time pressure we both face.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. With your inflation rate at 20% per round versus my 5%, delaying hurts you significantly more. The $350000 I'm offering you now is worth more than waiting another round. Let's conclude this negotiation - this is a fair compromise that recognizes our different inflation rates while giving you a substantial portion.",Alice,3,

580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. Your offer is getting closer, but we need to factor in the significant impact each round of delay has on the value of my share. This offer provides a more balanced distribution while acknowledging the time sensitivity due to the differing inflation rates.",Bob,4,
