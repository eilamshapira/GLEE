"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me
3. In the next round, I could propose, but $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me
4. The current offer gives me $4,500 right now, which is better than risking a potentially worse outcome after inflation

Since $4,500 now is a reasonable offer (45% of the total), and waiting would mean dealing with inflation, I'll accept this offer.
