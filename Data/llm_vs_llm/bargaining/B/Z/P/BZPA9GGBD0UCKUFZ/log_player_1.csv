I'm getting increasingly desperate here. Bob is clearly willing to wait me out.  I need to make a move that seems like a concession but still gets me a decent amount."

Round 6

Bob's offer:

It's painful, but I have to accept.  Another round and the inflation will eat away even more of my potential gains. Bob knows this and is ruthlessly exploiting the situation. Taking the $300,000 now is the best I can hope for in this scenario."
