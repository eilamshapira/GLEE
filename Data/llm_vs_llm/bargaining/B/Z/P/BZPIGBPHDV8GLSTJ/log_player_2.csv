"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has offered me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation for me across rounds, I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I should try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's slightly in my favor but still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55/45 split that gives both of us a substantial amount. This is more equitable than Alice's initial offer and recognizes the importance of reaching a mutual agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer since round 1, now offering me $450,000 (45%) instead of $400,000 (40%). It's interesting that she's experiencing inflation (9.75% so far), while I'm not. This gives me some negotiating advantage as the rounds progress.

Her current offer is better than her first one but still gives her more than me. Since I don't face inflation, I can afford to negotiate further to try to get a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice is experiencing inflation and I'm not, I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to me while still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than face further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering a 58/42 split that still gives Alice a substantial portion while improving my position. Given that Alice's money is losing value with each round, this offer provides her with certainty rather than risking further depreciation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered an equal 50/50 split, which is better than her previous offers. I notice she's already facing 18.55% inflation on her portion, which significantly reduces the actual value of what she receives. This puts me in a stronger negotiating position.

Given that:
1. This is a fair 50/50 split on paper
2. Alice's inflation penalty means she's incentivized to conclude this soon
3. We're at round 5 out of 12, so there's still time to negotiate
4. I don't face any inflation penalty

I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now experiencing 18.55% inflation and has offered a 50/50 split, I'll increase my request slightly but make it attractive enough that she might accept rather than risk further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Since Alice is facing significant inflation penalties that increase with each round, this offer gives her certainty of $400,000 now instead of potentially less valuable money in future rounds. We're halfway through our negotiation window, and I believe this is a reasonable compromise given our respective positions."
