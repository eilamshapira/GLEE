"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money equally so that both of us get a fair share right away. This way, we avoid the risk of inflation reducing our total amount in the upcoming rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'm offering you $450000, keeping $550000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I get a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
