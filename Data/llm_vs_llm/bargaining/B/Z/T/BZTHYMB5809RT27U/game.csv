55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates - my money devalues twice as fast as yours (10% vs 5%), so I need a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. If we drag this out, we both lose value, so let's make a deal early.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's cut our losses from inflation. I propose a straightforward, even split: $50 for you and $50 for me. Although your money devalues faster, agreeing now preserves more for both of us than dragging the game out. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances. What do you say?",Bob,2,
