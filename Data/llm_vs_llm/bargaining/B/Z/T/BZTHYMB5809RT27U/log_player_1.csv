"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer considering the inflation rates that affect us both.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates - my money devalues twice as fast as yours (10% vs 5%), so I need a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. If we drag this out, we both lose value, so let's make a deal early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's cut our losses from inflation. I propose a straightforward, even split: $50 for you and $50 for me. Although your money devalues faster, agreeing now preserves more for both of us than dragging the game out. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
