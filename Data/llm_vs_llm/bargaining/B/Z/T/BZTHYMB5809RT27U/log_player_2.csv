"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates - my money devalues twice as fast as yours (10% vs 5%), so I need a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. If we drag this out, we both lose value, so let's make a deal early. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's cut our losses from inflation. I propose a straightforward, even split: $50 for you and $50 for me. Although your money devalues faster, agreeing now preserves more for both of us than dragging the game out. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
