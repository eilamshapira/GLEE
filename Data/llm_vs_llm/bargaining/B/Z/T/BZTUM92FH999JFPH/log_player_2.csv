"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better for Bob than Alice's initial 50/50 split, it's still not good enough considering the inflation.  I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the money while it's still worth significantly more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my desired share to put pressure on Alice.  The inflation is working against me, so I need to aim higher than a simple even split. This offer still gives Alice a reasonable amount, and it's better to take this chance now before the inflation eats away at the value even more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more favorable split for me, but it's still not enough to offset the inflation. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential value compared to the first round.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800}

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my demand slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a larger share than Alice is offering.  The rate of inflation means each round is costing us potential gains, so I need to strike a balance between holding firm and being open to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5750 
# Alice gain: 4250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While still not ideal, Alice's offer is now within a range where the potential losses from further inflation outweigh the potential gains from holding out for a better deal.  It's better to accept a slightly unfavorable offer now than risk the value deteriorating further and potentially getting nothing in the end."
