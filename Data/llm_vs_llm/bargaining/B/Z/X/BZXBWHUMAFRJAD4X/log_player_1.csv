Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""I propose we split the money with me taking 800,000$ and you, Bob, taking 200,000$. This way, I ensure a larger share while still leaving you with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer still leaves you with a significant amount while addressing the devaluation of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
