"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first proposal for dividing the $10,000.

Since there's inflation that affects Bob (money is worth 20% less each round for him), I'll consider offering him a fair amount now, as waiting would make his portion less valuable to him.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. If we move to another round, the total value will be worth less to Bob due to his 20% inflation rate, so accepting this equal division now would be beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal that accounts for the inflation Bob faces.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I propose that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500. This is a reasonable compromise that gives Bob more than half while still being fair to me. 

Since Bob faces 20% inflation each round, this offer is actually better for him now than waiting for another round. If we go to round 4, his $5,500 would effectively be worth only $4,400 to him due to the 20% inflation he faces. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to future rounds where the total value Bob receives diminishes."
