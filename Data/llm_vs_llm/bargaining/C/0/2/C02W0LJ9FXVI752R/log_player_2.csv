"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $45 out of $100
- If I reject, we move to the next round where:
  * I can make a counter-offer
  * But the total money will be worth 5% less ($95 total)
  * My maximum potential gain in round 2 would be reduced

While a 50/50 split might seem more fair, Alice's reasoning for a slight advantage as first mover isn't unreasonable. If I reject, we risk losing value through inflation and potential further negotiation.

The offer gives me a decent portion ($45) without risking depreciation. It's better to secure this amount now than risk getting less in future rounds.
