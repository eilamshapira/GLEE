"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that I face value depreciation while Bob doesn't. This is still a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 50-50 split would normally be fair, but due to the 10% inflation penalty I face, I would effectively only get $450,000 in round 1 value, while Bob gets the full $500,000. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for this disparity."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

Due to the 20% inflation penalty I now face, I need to propose a 65-35 split to achieve a more equitable outcome in terms of real value. With the 20% penalty, my $650,000 is worth $520,000 in round 1 value, while Bob's $350,000 maintains its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 27.1% inflation penalty, this offer would give me only $328,050 in round 1 value (450000 * 0.729), while Bob gets the full $550,000. This is very unfavorable for me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for the growing inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

With the 34.4% inflation penalty I now face (1 - 0.9^5), I need to propose a 70-30 split to achieve a more balanced outcome in real value. My $700,000 would be worth approximately $459,200 in round 1 value (700000 * 0.656), while Bob's $300,000 maintains its full value. This split aims to compensate for the significant inflation penalty I'm facing while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 40.95% inflation penalty, this offer would give me only $236,200 in round 1 value (400000 * 0.5905), while Bob gets the full $600,000. This is extremely unfavorable for me. We're only halfway through the possible rounds, so I'll make a counter-offer that better reflects the inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

With the 46.86% inflation penalty I now face (1 - 0.9^7), I need to propose a 75-25 split. My $750,000 would be worth approximately $398,550 in round 1 value (750000 * 0.5314), while Bob's $250,000 maintains its full value. This split better compensates for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing while still giving Bob a quarter of the total amount. We need to reach an agreement soon as the inflation penalty is becoming more severe with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 52.17% inflation penalty, this offer would give me only $167,405 in round 1 value (350000 * 0.4783), while Bob gets the full $650,000. This is an extremely poor deal for me. With 4 rounds remaining, I still have room to negotiate for a better split that accounts for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

With the 56.95% inflation penalty I now face (1 - 0.9^9), I need to propose an 80-20 split. My $800,000 would be worth approximately $344,400 in round 1 value (800000 * 0.4305), while Bob's $200,000 maintains its full value. We need to reach an agreement quickly as we only have a few rounds left, and the inflation penalty is severely impacting my potential gains. This split aims to achieve a more equitable outcome in real value terms while still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't an ideal offer, I'll accept it for several reasons:
1. With the 61.26% inflation penalty, my $300,000 would be worth about $116,220 in round 1 value (300000 * 0.3874)
2. We only have 2 rounds left, and the inflation penalty will get even worse
3. If we fail to reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing
4. Bob has consistently rejected more favorable splits, suggesting he's unlikely to accept better offers in the remaining rounds

Better to secure some value now than risk getting nothing or an even worse deal later."
