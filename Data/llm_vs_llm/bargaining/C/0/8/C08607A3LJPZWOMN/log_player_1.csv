"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's better than an even split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less next round due to 10% inflation
3. The offer gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $5500, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $5225 to me
2. Bob would get $4500, which due to 10% inflation is worth $4050 to him
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
4. The split is relatively fair, and I'm still getting more than half
5. Every round reduces the real value of money for both of us

Since this is a reasonable offer and the value will only decrease with time, I'll accept.
