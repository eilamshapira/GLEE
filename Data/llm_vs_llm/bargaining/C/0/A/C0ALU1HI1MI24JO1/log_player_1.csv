"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to act fast with inflation, but 40% is too low. How about we meet in the middle at 45% for me? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable compromise, and with inflation reducing the value in future rounds, it makes sense to agree now rather than continue negotiating. The 55-45 split is fair enough, and waiting longer would only decrease the real value for both of us."
