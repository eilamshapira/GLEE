"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $550,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk further inflation.
