This is getting risky, but I'm hoping Alice will crack under the pressure of inflation. My offers have been reasonable and fair."

I'm matching her offer from Round 1. It's becoming increasingly important for her to settle due to inflation, while my value remains constant."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is getting too risky. While ideally, I'd like a larger share, accepting this prevents me from potentially getting a worse offer in future rounds as inflation eats away at Alice's perceived value."
