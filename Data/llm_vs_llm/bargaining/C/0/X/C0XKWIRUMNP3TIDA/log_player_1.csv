"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that any delay will reduce the value of your share due to the 5% inflation penalty you face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a fair compromise. Let's end this quickly and share equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept this offer, I get $500,000 (full value)
- If I reject and propose in the next round:
  * Bob will face another 5% inflation penalty
  * I could potentially negotiate for more
  * But Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds
- The current offer is fair and substantial
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations
