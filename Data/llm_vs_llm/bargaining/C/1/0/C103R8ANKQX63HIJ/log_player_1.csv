"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and considers the inflation effect on me. You can think 60/40 is reasonable, but it's not reasonable for me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer is now considering the inflation effect on him, I should take into account that his $5000 is actually worth less to him than $5000 was in the previous round.

Considering this, I think the 50/50 split is a good deal for me, as it gives me a larger share of the total value.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
