"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it in a way that is advantageous to me. Take it or leave it, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it's important to be mindful of the declining value, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal in the next round. Let's see what Alice comes up with when the pressure is on her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling generous, but this is a fair split considering the declining value. Let's close this deal now.""} 

I believe this offer is aggressive enough to give me a good advantage, yet potentially acceptable to Alice given the inflation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I'm feeling a bit more generous this round. Let's try this split. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's generosity still heavily favors her.  While the decreasing value makes each round more critical, accepting this would be a mistake. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer.  It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""}

Explanation: 

This offer sends a strong signal. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  By calling it my final offer, I increase the pressure on Alice. She knows I'm serious about walking away.
* **Shift in Power:** This offer is less about being ""fair"" and more about recognizing the declining value heavily favors me now. It subtly suggests Alice loses more by continuing.
* **Potential for Agreement:** While aggressive, there's still a chance Alice, fearing the rapid depreciation, might accept to secure something rather than risk getting nothing. 

This is a calculated risk, but given the game dynamics, it's a strong play at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is starting to get ridiculous. Last chance to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but I have to acknowledge the situation. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Severely Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, particularly for Alice.  Waiting any longer will significantly impact any potential gains for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing means risking getting zero if we can't agree in the next round. Accepting now guarantees I at least get something, even if it's less than I initially aimed for.
* **Alice's Position:** Her message implies a strong stance and a low likelihood of offering anything better. 

While not the ideal outcome, accepting now minimizes potential losses and allows me to walk away with something."
