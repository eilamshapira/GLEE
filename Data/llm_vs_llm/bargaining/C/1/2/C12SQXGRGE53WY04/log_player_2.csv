"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

The offer gives me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total amount. While it's not an even split, it's a fairly reasonable offer. 

Given that:
1. I get a substantial amount ($4,500)
2. There's no inflation affecting my share
3. I can make a counter-offer if I reject, but Alice might reject my offer
4. Negotiating further might risk ending up with less

I'll make a strategic decision to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, $4,500 is a good enough outcome, and there's risk in continuing the negotiation.
