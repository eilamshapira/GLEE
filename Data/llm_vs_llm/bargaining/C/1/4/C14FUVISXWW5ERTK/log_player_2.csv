"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make an offer
3. $400,000 now is better than $450,000 in the next round due to the 10% inflation
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation or reaching the 12-round limit

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation penalty, I think this is a reasonable first offer. While not perfectly equal, the difference isn't large enough to justify the guaranteed 10% loss from rejecting.
