"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. This way we both get a substantial amount without risking depreciation through multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she takes $550,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'd make a counter-offer, but the money would be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This creates an interesting dynamic where delaying favors me relatively.

However, $450,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's risk in prolonging negotiations. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

While I could potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round, Alice's initial offer is reasonable enough that the guaranteed $450,000 now may be better than risking further negotiations.
