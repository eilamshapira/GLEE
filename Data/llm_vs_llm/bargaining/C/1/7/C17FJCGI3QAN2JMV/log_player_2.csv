"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

While this is a substantial amount of money, it's not an equal split of the $1,000,000. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, which gives me an opportunity to suggest a more favorable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share of $500,000. What do you think?""}"
