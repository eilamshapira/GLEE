"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.
