"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is $5500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 to me.
Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% less in round 1 and another 5% less in round 2).

To make a fair offer, I'll take this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is $5000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth $5000 * 0.729 = $3645 to me.

On the other hand, if I reject the offer, I'll have to make another proposal, and the inflation will increase again.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is relatively fair, and it's better than risking further inflation.
