Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both walk away with a good amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation reducing our gains.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
