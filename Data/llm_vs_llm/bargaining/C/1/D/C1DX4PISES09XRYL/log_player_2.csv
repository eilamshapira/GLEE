"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm taking the lion's share, but you still get a good chunk. Think smart. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me just 10% of the total amount, which is quite low. Even with the 5% inflation penalty per round, I can make a counter-offer in the next round that would be more favorable to me. The total amount would be 9,500$ in round 2, which still gives plenty of room for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the time pressure we're both under.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both walk away with a good amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation reducing our gains.""}"
