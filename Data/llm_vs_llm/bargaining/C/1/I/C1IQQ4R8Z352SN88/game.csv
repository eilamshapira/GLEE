500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it fairly down the middle. 500000 for each of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate the fair offer, but since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. This offer gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round when your share would be worth less due to inflation. This is mutually beneficial.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Given the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $400000 for me and $600000 for you. This still gives you a larger portion while ensuring I get something reasonable before my share devalues further.",Alice,3,
