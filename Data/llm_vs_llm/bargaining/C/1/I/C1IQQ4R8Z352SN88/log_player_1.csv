"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair offer, but since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. This offer gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round when your share would be worth less due to inflation. This is mutually beneficial. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
