"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle. 500000 for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing an equal split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I should account for the inflation aspect mentioned in the rules.

For me (Bob), the money doesn't lose value over rounds (0% inflation).
For Alice, the money loses 10% value each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would value the total amount at only 900,000$ (10% less). This gives me negotiating leverage.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fair offer, but since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, a slight adjustment makes economic sense for both of us. This offer gives you $450,000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round when your share would be worth less due to inflation. This is mutually beneficial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $400000 for me and $600000 for you. This still gives you a larger portion while ensuring I get something reasonable before my share devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $600,000 and taking $400,000 for herself.

If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, Alice would face 29% total inflation (from round 1)
- This would further decrease the value of any money for Alice
- I could potentially negotiate for an even better deal

However, $600,000 is already a good outcome for me, representing 60% of the total. Additionally, there's always the risk that negotiations could break down if I push too hard.

Given that Alice has already moved significantly from the initial 50/50 split and offered me a favorable 60/40 split, this seems like a reasonable deal.
