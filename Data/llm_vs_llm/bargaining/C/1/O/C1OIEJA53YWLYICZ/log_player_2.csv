"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation penalty that affects only my share:

* Current offer: $5000
* After 20% inflation: $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 effective value for me

While this is a substantial decrease in value for me, I should consider:
1. Each round will reduce my purchasing power by another 20%
2. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she has less incentive to compromise
3. There are 12 rounds maximum, but we could end up with nothing

I'll reject this offer since I can propose next round and try to get a larger share to offset my inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm affected by inflation and Alice isn't, I should propose a split that compensates for this disadvantage. After one round, my money is worth 20% less, so I need a larger share to achieve fair value.

To get an effective $5000 (fair split) after the 20% inflation:
$5000 / 0.8 = $6250 needed for me

I'll propose slightly more to make it worth the inflation I've already incurred:

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

This offer would give me an effective value of $6500 * 0.8 = $5200 after inflation, while Alice gets $3500 at full value. This is reasonably fair considering my inflation penalty, but still attractive enough for Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

* Offered amount: $4500
* After 36% inflation: $4500 * 0.64 = $2880 effective value for me
* Alice gets $5500 at full value

This is a worse deal than the initial offer because:
1. My effective value has dropped significantly ($2880 vs $4000 in round 1)
2. Alice is actually asking for more than before ($5500 vs $5000 in round 1)
3. The total split has shifted more in Alice's favor

If I reject, the next round will have 48.8% inflation for me. However, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal than receiving an effective $2880.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With 48.8% inflation affecting my share now, I need to carefully calculate my offer. The situation is becoming more urgent as the inflation increases with each round.

To get an effective $5000 (fair split) after 48.8% inflation:
$5000 / 0.512 â‰ˆ $9766

However, asking for nearly all the money would likely be rejected. I need to balance between compensating for my inflation and making an offer Alice might accept to avoid further rounds of value destruction.

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

This would give me an effective value of:
$7500 * 0.512 = $3840 after inflation

While this gives me less than a ""fair"" split in effective value, it's better than the previous offer, and leaving $2500 for Alice might make it acceptable to her. We need to reach an agreement soon as my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

* Offered amount: $4000
* After 59.04% inflation: $4000 * 0.4096 = $1,638.40 effective value for me
* Alice gets $6000 at full value

The situation is getting worse:
1. My effective value continues to drop dramatically ($1,638.40 now vs $2880 in round 3)
2. Alice is asking for even more ($6000 vs $5500 in round 3)
3. Each round the inflation severely weakens my position
4. We're now in round 5 of 12, so we still have time, but the inflation is becoming very punishing

However, my effective value is now so low that continuing to negotiate might be risky. If I reject, I'll face about 67.2% inflation next round, meaning I'd need an enormous share just to get the same effective value.

Given the rapidly deteriorating situation and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I should accept this offer.
