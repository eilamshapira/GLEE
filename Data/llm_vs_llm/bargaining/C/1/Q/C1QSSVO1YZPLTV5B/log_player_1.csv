Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, let's be a bit more equitable. How about a 55-45 split in my favor?  Time is ticking and the money's value is decreasing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
