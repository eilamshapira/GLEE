550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'm proposing a 45/55 division that gives you the majority while still being fair to me. Keep in mind that inflation affects me by 10% each round, so I have incentive to reach an agreement soon. I hope we can settle this efficiently and both walk away with a significant amount.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"I understand you're looking for a fairer deal, but I'm still hoping for a larger share. Let's try a 70/30 split. This is a reasonable compromise, given the inflation factor. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the value drops further.",Alice,3,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your improved offer of 70/30. I'm now proposing a 40/60 split, which still gives you the majority share. As we're now in round 4, inflation has already reduced my potential value by 19%, and it will continue to affect me more severely than you. This compromise balances our interests while acknowledging the time pressure. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares diminish further.",Bob,4,
