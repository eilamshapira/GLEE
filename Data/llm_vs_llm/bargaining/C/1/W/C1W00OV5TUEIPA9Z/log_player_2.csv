"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. I'm willing to share a significant portion, but I need to secure the majority for myself. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $100,000 (10%) while she takes $900,000 (90%). 

Given that we have 12 potential rounds and each round reduces the value by 10% for me due to inflation, I should calculate if rejecting makes sense. If I counter-offer, I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject, and we'd continue with diminishing returns.

This early in the game, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm facing while still being reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'm proposing a 45/55 division that gives you the majority while still being fair to me. Keep in mind that inflation affects me by 10% each round, so I have incentive to reach an agreement soon. I hope we can settle this efficiently and both walk away with a significant amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fairer deal, but I'm still hoping for a larger share. Let's try a 70/30 split. This is a reasonable compromise, given the inflation factor. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now proposing I get $300,000 (30%) while she takes $700,000 (70%), which is significantly better than her initial 90/10 split.

Given that inflation is already reducing my potential gain by 19%, accepting now means I'd effectively get about $243,000 in first-round value. If I reject and we continue haggling, the inflation will continue to erode my share.

Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine (9.75% vs. 19% after two rounds), which suggests she has less pressure to conclude quickly. Her improved offer shows willingness to compromise, and since we're only in round 3 of 12, I think we can reach an even better agreement.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your improved offer of 70/30. I'm now proposing a 40/60 split, which still gives you the majority share. As we're now in round 4, inflation has already reduced my potential value by 19%, and it will continue to affect me more severely than you. This compromise balances our interests while acknowledging the time pressure. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares diminish further.""}"
