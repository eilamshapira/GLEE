{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but a 50/50 split isn't fair considering I proposed first.  This offer still gives you a significant amount."" 
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a slightly better split than Bob offered, but showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's important to balance greed with the risk of getting nothing if time runs out."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer."

""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is a reasonable offer and closer to my original proposal. Let's settle this now.""

I'm holding firm on my previous offer amount while emphasizing the time constraint. Bob needs to understand that his indecision is costing us both potential gains."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob is acknowledging the time pressure, his offer is still not favorable considering the increasing inflation working against me. I need to push for a better split, but I also need to be wary of the dwindling time."

""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising again. This is a fair deal considering we are running out of time. Let's close this deal and avoid losing everything.""
}
```

I'm slightly lowering my demand to show flexibility but still aiming for a significantly better share than Bob's offer. The emphasis on the shrinking time is crucial to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my proposal is getting closer to your requests. Let's finalize our agreement and ensure we both gain from this. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains, and while this offer isn't ideal, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, though not ideal, payout."
