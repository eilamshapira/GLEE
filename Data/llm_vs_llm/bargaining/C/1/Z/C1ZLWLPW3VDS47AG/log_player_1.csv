"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since I know there's a 20% inflation penalty for each round for me (but not for Bob), I should make a compelling first offer to avoid losing value.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is favorable to me but not so greedy that Bob would definitely reject it.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose taking $600,000 for myself and giving $400,000 to Bob. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, I'll lose 20% purchasing power in the next round, but he won't face any penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
* I get $300,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $240,000 to me
* Bob gets $700,000 at full value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
* Any money I get will be worth another 20% less (total 40% less than round 1)
* I'd need to offer Bob something very attractive to accept
* Even if I propose a better split, my share would be worth significantly less due to 40% inflation

Given that any future rounds will significantly reduce the value of my share due to compounding inflation, and Bob's current offer still gives me a meaningful amount ($240,000 in effective value), I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in future rounds.
