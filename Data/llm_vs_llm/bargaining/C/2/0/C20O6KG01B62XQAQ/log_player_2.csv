"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. Fair deal? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount ($400,000), I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% inflation), I have no urgency to accept a less-than-equal split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares of $500,000.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 55-45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's new offer gives me $450,000, which is better than her first offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, but Alice is experiencing inflation on her end, she seems to be getting more motivated to reach an agreement. However, I still think I can get a better deal, especially since we have several rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're affected by inflation, which puts you at a disadvantage as rounds progress. I'm offering you $475,000 now, which is worth more to you than a larger amount in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation situations.""}"
