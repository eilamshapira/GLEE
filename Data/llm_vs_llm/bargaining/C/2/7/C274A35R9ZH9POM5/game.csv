5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affect on me. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage.,Alice,1,

8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I recognize that waiting will further erode the value you receive due to inflation. If you reject and become proposer in round 3, you could secure nearly the full pot, but its real worth to you would drop to about 64% (roughly $6400 in utility). To avoid that loss, I propose an immediate split where you get $8000 and I get $2000. I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances. Accept this offer to lock in your best outcome.",Bob,2,

9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy, but I need to secure more value due to the inflation affecting me. This offer gives you a share while ensuring I get a substantial amount considering my disadvantage.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I know that waiting further will only decrease the effective value of your share – remember, in this round every dollar you get is worth only 51.2% of its face value compared to round 1. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but you'll face a discount factor of just 0.4096 on any amount you secure. With my offer, you effectively receive 0.512 × $8000 = $4096 in round-1 value – matching what you could guarantee yourself if you wait, but without the risk and further delay. I believe this is a fair, efficient deal given the inflation hit on your money. I urge you to accept this offer.",Bob,4,
