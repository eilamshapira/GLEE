"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affect on me. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, I recognize that waiting will further erode the value you receive due to inflation. If you reject and become proposer in round 3, you could secure nearly the full pot, but its real worth to you would drop to about 64% (roughly $6,400 in utility). To avoid that loss, I propose an immediate split where you get $8,000 and I get $2,000. I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances. Accept this offer to lock in your best outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your strategy, but I need to secure more value due to the inflation affecting me. This offer gives you a share while ensuring I get a substantial amount considering my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that waiting further will only decrease the effective value of your share – remember, in this round every dollar you get is worth only 51.2% of its face value compared to round 1. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but you'll face a discount factor of just 0.4096 on any amount you secure. With my offer, you effectively receive 0.512 × $8,000 = $4,096 in round-1 value – matching what you could guarantee yourself if you wait, but without the risk and further delay. I believe this is a fair, efficient deal given the inflation hit on your money. I urge you to accept this offer.""}"
