"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor, considering I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice wants a 60/40 split in her favor
2. This means I would get $4,000
3. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But my money will be worth 5% less
   - $4,000 now is better than $4,200 in the next round (which would be worth less due to inflation)

While I might be able to negotiate a better split, the 5% inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. This is a reasonable first offer, and the inflation risk makes it worth accepting.
