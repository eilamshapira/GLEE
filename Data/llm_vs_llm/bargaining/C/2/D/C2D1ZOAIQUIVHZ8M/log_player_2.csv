"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a fair split, Bob. Let's end this quickly and take our money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
2. This is not exactly a fair split as she claims
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. The money doesn't lose value for me due to inflation (0% effect)
5. I can potentially get a better deal by making my own proposal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's do a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last offer. Take it or leave it. My share is worth less each round! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is still offering me $40, keeping $60
2. I now know that Alice's money is affected by inflation (36% less value for her)
3. Her $60 is now worth effectively $38.40 to her due to inflation
4. My $40 maintains its full value as I'm not affected by inflation
5. If I reject, we go to another round where inflation will hurt her position even more
6. However, this repeated rejection might lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't agree

Given that:
- Alice's effective gain ($38.40) is now actually less than my $40
- She seems more pressured to make a deal due to inflation
- I could potentially get an even better deal next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing significant inflation pressure, I'll make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation affecting your gains, this split actually gives you more value now than waiting further. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm giving you more this time. Don't be greedy and accept now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $45 (up from previous $40)
2. Her $55 is worth 59.04% less due to inflation
3. Her effective gain is only $22.53 ($55 * 0.4096)
4. My $45 maintains its full value
5. The inflation is severely impacting her position
6. She's showing signs of frustration (""Don't be greedy"")
7. Her real value received is less than half of mine due to inflation

Since:
- I'm getting a better offer ($45)
- Alice is in a much weaker position due to inflation
- Further rounds might risk breaking down negotiations
- My $45 is worth significantly more than her inflation-adjusted $22.53
