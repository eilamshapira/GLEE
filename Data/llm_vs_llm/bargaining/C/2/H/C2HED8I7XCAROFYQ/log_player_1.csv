"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect future rounds and I want to make it attractive for Bob to accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept immediately rather than risk inflation
3. If Bob declines, my share would be worth 5% less in the next round, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable first offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $450,000 worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth another 5% less for me (90% of original value)
   - Bob might be even less cooperative
   - We're burning rounds and risk getting nothing if we reach round 12

Given that Bob's offer is fairly reasonable and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept.
