5200.0,4800.0,"I see you're moving toward a more balanced split, which I appreciate. Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, a 48-52 split seems fair and beneficial for both of us to agree now rather than continue negotiating. This is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,4,

5300.0,4700.0,"I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Given your increasing inflation penalty (now over 34%), it makes sense for both of us to reach an agreement soon. This 47-53 split is very close to equal and reflects a fair compromise considering our situation. Let's avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for you even more.",Bob,6,
