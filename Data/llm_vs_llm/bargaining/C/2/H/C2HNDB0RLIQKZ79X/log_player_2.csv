"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $4,000 while she receives $6,000. The first round can set an important precedent, and this offer gives me 40% of the total.

Given that inflation doesn't affect my value (0% inflation rate for me), there's no downside to negotiating for a better deal. Since I'll be the one making the proposal in the next round if I reject, I have an opportunity to suggest a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the most fair approach. We both deserve an equal share of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Met you halfway from my initial offer, 58-42 is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this revised offer. Alice has moved from a 60-40 split to a 58-42 split, which is a small improvement but still not an equal division. She's now offering me $4,200 instead of $4,000.

The interesting information is that Alice is experiencing 19% inflation, meaning her gains are worth less as rounds progress. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as delay affects her more than me (I have 0% inflation).

Since I'm not facing any inflation penalty, I can continue negotiating for a better deal. Alice is already showing willingness to move toward the middle, and with her inflation pressure, she may concede more in future rounds.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""I see you're moving toward a more balanced split, which I appreciate. Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, a 48-52 split seems fair and beneficial for both of us to agree now rather than continue negotiating. This is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, 56-44 is as low as I can go considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this situation. Alice has now offered me $4,400 (44%) while keeping $5,600 (56%) for herself. She's incrementally improving her offers, moving from 40% to 42% to now 44% for me.

The key factor here is that Alice's inflation has increased to 34.39%, which significantly reduces the value of her gains as we continue to negotiate. This gives me strategic leverage.

However, I also need to be reasonable. She's moving in the right direction, but we still have 7 more potential rounds, and her inflation penalty is growing. If I reject now, I can propose something closer to 50-50 in the next round, and her increasing inflation pressure may make her more likely to accept.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, 
""alice_gain"": 5300, 
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Given your increasing inflation penalty (now over 34%), it makes sense for both of us to reach an agreement soon. This 47-53 split is very close to equal and reflects a fair compromise considering our situation. Let's avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for you even more.""}"
