"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round. So in round 2, the maximum I could get would be worth 9,500$ to me.

While 4000$ is less than half, it's still a significant amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we could enter a cycle of rejections where the money keeps losing value for me.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, I think it's better to secure a decent amount now rather than risk getting less later.
