"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I want to make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation effect on my gains. Since I'll face a 5% reduction in value per round, I should propose a reasonable split now.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face a 5% inflation penalty each round we delay, while you don't lose value. If we go to the next round, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my loss, or you'll need to offer me more. Let's agree now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I propose a 50/50 split. While I understand your concerns about inflation, I believe this split is fair for both of us and ensures that we both walk away with an equal amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
