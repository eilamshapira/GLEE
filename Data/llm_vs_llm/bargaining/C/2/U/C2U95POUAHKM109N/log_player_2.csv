"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face a 5% inflation penalty each round we delay, while you don't lose value. If we go to the next round, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my loss, or you'll need to offer me more. Let's agree now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
