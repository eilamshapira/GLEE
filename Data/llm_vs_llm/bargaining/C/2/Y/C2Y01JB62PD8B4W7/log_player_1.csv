"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that we have 12 rounds and need to reach an agreement, I'll propose a fair split while considering that we both want to maximize our gains.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly without risking further rounds."
