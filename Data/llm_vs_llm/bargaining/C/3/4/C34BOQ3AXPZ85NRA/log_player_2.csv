"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split, 50-50. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now and propose in the next round, the $50 I could get now would be worth $40 in the next round. Any further delays would reduce the value even more significantly.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 50-50 split is a fair starting offer and the inflation risk makes it unwise to reject. Taking $50 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.
