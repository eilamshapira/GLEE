"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose an early agreement to avoid the risk of inflation on my end. I'm offering you $5300 and I'll take $4700. I believe this is a fair split that rewards early settlement. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $5300 out of the $10,000, which is slightly more than half. If I reject and we continue to the next round, I'll be able to make my own offer, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject it too, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that Alice's current offer already gives me more than half, and considering the risk of inflation with each passing round, I'll accept this offer.
