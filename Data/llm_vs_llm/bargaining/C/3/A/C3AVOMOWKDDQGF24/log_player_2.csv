"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm rejecting Alice's offer, the value of the money decreases by 5% for me. So, the total value of the money for me is now $100 * 0.95 = $95.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the original $100, but considering the decreased value for me.
