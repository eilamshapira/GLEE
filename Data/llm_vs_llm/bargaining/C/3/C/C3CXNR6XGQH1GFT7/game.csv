600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. Accepting now guarantees us the full value of the money before any inflation effects hit. Let's secure our gains together and finish this round quickly.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share. Let's divide the money in a way that's more balanced, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before the value drops further.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement if we continue the negotiation. I'll propose my division in the next round. Let's keep working towards a mutually acceptable solution!",Alice,2,reject
460000.0,540000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my counter-proposal for round 3: I receive $460000 and you receive $540000. I know your previous offer was 550K nominal, but if we delay further, the inflation will only hurt you more. Accepting this deal guarantees you a solid share before any additional value loss. Let's wrap this up now and avoid further depreciation!",Alice,3,
