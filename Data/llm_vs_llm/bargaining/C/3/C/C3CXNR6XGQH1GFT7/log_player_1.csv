"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share. Let's divide the money in a way that's more balanced, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement if we continue the negotiation.

I know your previous offer was 550K nominal, but if we delay further, the inflation will only hurt you more. Accepting this deal guarantees you a solid share before any additional value loss. Let's wrap this up now and avoid further depreciation!""}"
