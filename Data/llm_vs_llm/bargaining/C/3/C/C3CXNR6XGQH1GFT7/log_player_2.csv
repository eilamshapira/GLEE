"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. Accepting now guarantees us the full value of the money before any inflation effects hit. Let's secure our gains together and finish this round quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share. Let's divide the money in a way that's more balanced, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my counter-proposal for round 3: I receive $460000 and you receive $540000. I know your previous offer was 550K nominal, but if we delay further, the inflation will only hurt you more. Accepting this deal guarantees you a solid share before any additional value loss. Let's wrap this up now and avoid further depreciation! 
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
