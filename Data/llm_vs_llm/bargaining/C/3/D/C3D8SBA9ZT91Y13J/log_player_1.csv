"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives us an equal split of $500,000 each, I'll consider it.

However, I need to take into account the inflation. For me, the $500,000 is worth 5% less than in the first round, so its value is 500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

For Bob, the $500,000 is worth 20% less than in the first round, but that's his concern, not mine.

Considering my own valuation, $475,000 is still a significant amount, and accepting this offer would guarantee I get something.

My response:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
