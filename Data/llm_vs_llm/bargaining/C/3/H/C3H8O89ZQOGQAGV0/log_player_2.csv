"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering inflation affects me at 20% per round, so waiting is costly for me. If we don't agree soon, we both lose. This gives you a substantial $40 right now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice claims she has 20% inflation, but I can't verify this. My inflation is 10% per round.

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The $100 will be worth $90 to me
   - I could propose a more favorable split
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further value loss

3. Current offer gives me $40 immediately
   - If I wait one round and somehow get $60, it would be worth $54 (due to 10% inflation)
   - Would need to get significantly more to make waiting worthwhile

4. We have 12 rounds total, but value decreases each round
   - Getting something now might be better than risking a long negotiation

5. $40 is a substantial amount and close to a fair split

Given these factors, especially the certainty of getting $40 now versus the uncertainty and guaranteed value loss of continuing, I'll accept this offer.
