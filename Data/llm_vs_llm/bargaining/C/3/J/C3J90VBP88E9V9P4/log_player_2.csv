"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While she calls it a ""fair 60-40 split,"" it's actually favoring her significantly. In a first-round offer, there's usually room for a more equitable division. Since we have 11 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, suggesting a 50-50 division which is truly fair for both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a perfectly fair 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of $5,000.""}"
