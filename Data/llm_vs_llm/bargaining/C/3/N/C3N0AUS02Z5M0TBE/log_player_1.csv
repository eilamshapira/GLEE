"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer, but is still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than risking inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while avoiding the risk of inflation reducing the value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $640,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $576,000 to me
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But the money will be worth even less (20% less than original for me)
   - And there's risk of further rejections

Bob's offer is actually quite favorable to me, giving me a larger share that, even with inflation, is better than my initial proposal. The $576,000 effective value is higher than the $550,000 I originally proposed.
