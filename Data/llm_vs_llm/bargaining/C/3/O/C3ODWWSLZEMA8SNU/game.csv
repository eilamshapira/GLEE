650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $650000 and you $350000 in this first round. Considering that the deal gets discounted by 10% for me in each subsequent round, let's agree now so we both secure our shares without delay. I believe this fair split benefits both of us and avoids the risk of waiting further.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400000 for you now is better than waiting for future rounds where your potential gains will decrease. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to avoid further devaluation of your share.",Bob,2,
