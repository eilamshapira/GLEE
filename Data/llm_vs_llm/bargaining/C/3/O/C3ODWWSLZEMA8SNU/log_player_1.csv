"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $650,000 and you $350,000 in this first round. Considering that the deal gets discounted by 10% for me in each subsequent round, let's agree now so we both secure our shares without delay. I believe this fair split benefits both of us and avoids the risk of waiting further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400000 for you now is better than waiting for future rounds where your potential gains will decrease. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to avoid further devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
