"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $650000 and you $350000 in this first round. Considering that the deal gets discounted by 10% for me in each subsequent round, let's agree now so we both secure our shares without delay. I believe this fair split benefits both of us and avoids the risk of waiting further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice wants $650,000, leaving me with $350,000. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), I can safely wait for better offers without losing value. Alice revealed that she faces 10% inflation per round, which weakens her bargaining position in later rounds.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round when Alice's maximum potential gain has decreased by 10%. This gives me leverage to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice revealed she faces 10% inflation per round, and I face no inflation, I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still being attractive to her given her time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this offer of $400,000 for you now is better than waiting for future rounds where your potential gains will decrease. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to avoid further devaluation of your share.""}"
