Explanation:
Because time matters much more for Bob—each additional round further reduces the effective value of any money he receives—if you (Bob) reject this offer in round 3 you’d get to propose in round 4 but at an even steeper discount. Knowing that your alternative is very weak (and that I, being patient, would soon capture almost all the pie in later rounds), it is in your best interest to accept even a very small share now. Thus, offering you 1 $ (which is worth about 0.9 $ in round‐3 terms) barely beats the continuation value you’d get by waiting, and so you should accept."
