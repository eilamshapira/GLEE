"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is completely unfair as it gives me nothing. In the next round, I can make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that any further delay will cause the money to be worth less for me due to the 5% inflation penalty per round, while Alice faces no such penalty. A 60-40 split gives both of us a substantial portion of the money, and accepting now is in both our interests to avoid value deterioration."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still extremely unfair, giving me only $1 while Alice takes $99. Even with the 9.75% inflation penalty, making a counter-offer for a more equitable split would be better than accepting such a low amount. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Alice compared to my previous offer, moving from 60-40 to 55-45. This is still a fair division considering that I'm now facing a 14.26% inflation penalty (after this round), while Alice faces no penalty. By accepting this offer, we can both walk away with a substantial amount, and further delays would only erode my share's value. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties."
