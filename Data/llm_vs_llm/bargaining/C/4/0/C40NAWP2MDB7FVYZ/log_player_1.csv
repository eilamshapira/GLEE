"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Due to 20% inflation, the $50 I would receive is actually worth $40 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but everything will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offer is an equal split, which is fair in nominal terms, but due to inflation, I'm getting significantly less real value than what I offered in round 1
4. However, if I reject, the next round's inflation will likely make both of us worse off

Given that further delays will only reduce the total value available to split, I'll accept this offer.
