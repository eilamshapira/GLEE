"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly, $50 each. This way, we both benefit equally without having to worry about inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
If I accept now, I get $50 at full value.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation.
Even if I managed to get a better split next round, say $60, it would only be worth $48 after inflation.
The $50-$50 split is fair and accepting now maximizes my value.
