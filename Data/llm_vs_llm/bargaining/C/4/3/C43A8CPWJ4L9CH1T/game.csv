6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it in a way that gives me a bit more since I made the first offer. Fair enough?,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"I believe an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. There's no reason one of us should get more than the other, and equal division is the standard way to resolve situations like this. Let's both walk away with $5000.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation affecting my gains, let's adjust the split slightly, giving me a bit more to account for that. This way you still get a fair amount close to 50-50. What do you say?",Alice,3,
