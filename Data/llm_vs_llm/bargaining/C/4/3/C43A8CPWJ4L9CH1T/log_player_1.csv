"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. There's no reason one of us should get more than the other, and equal division is the standard way to resolve situations like this. Let's both walk away with $5000. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
