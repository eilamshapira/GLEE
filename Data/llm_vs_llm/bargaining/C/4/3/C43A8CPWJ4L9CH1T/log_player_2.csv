"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it in a way that gives me a bit more since I made the first offer. Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is suggesting that she should get more money ($6,000) because she made the first offer, while I would get $4,000. This isn't an equal split, and there's no compelling reason why making the first offer should entitle her to a larger share.

Since there's no inflation for me between rounds, I don't lose anything by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round. I can try to negotiate a more favorable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair split with a reasonable explanation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I believe an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. There's no reason one of us should get more than the other, and equal division is the standard way to resolve situations like this. Let's both walk away with $5,000.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation affecting my gains, let's adjust the split slightly, giving me a bit more to account for that. This way you still get a fair amount close to 50-50. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now mentioning that inflation is affecting her gains, so she's proposing a split where I get $4,750 and she gets $5,250. This is closer to an even split than her first offer.

I need to consider:
1. If I reject this, we'll go to round 4 where I can make another offer
2. Alice mentions inflation is affecting her, but not how much
3. The current offer is reasonably close to 50-50

Since there's still no inflation affecting my gains, I could reject and propose another split. However, if inflation continues to affect Alice's gains in future rounds, she might be less willing to accept a fair split later. This current offer is fairly reasonable - I get 47.5% of the total.
