"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm ready. My offer for Round 1 is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation affecting my gains, I need to consider the real value.  Let's see...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, the $3500 Bob is offering is only worth 3500 * (1 - 0.20) = $2800 in real terms.

Given that, I must answer:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the continued inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
