"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be fair but also consider the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% of the total amount and Bob 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
400000 * 0.8 = 320000

And for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so he'd get:
600000 * 0.9 = 540000

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (20% less than the previous round, which was already 20% less than the initial round), I need to make an offer that takes this into account.

The total value of the money for me is now:
1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 640,000

And for Bob, it's:
1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 810,000

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of the total value, considering the decreasing value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
420000 * 0.512 = 215040

And for Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less, so he'd get:
580000 * 0.729 = 422920

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but I need to be careful since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now, I need to make an offer that takes this into account.

The total value of the money for me is now:
1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 409600

And for Bob, it's:
1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 656100

I'll make an offer that gives me a significant portion, considering the rapidly decreasing value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 67.23% less for me, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
440000 * 0.3277 = 144118

And for Bob, the money is worth 40.95% less, so he'd get:
560000 * 0.5905 = 330840

Considering this, I think I should accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds.
