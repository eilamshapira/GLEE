"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering potential future negotiations and the 10% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because while I want a favorable deal, I also want to avoid too many rounds due to the inflation penalty affecting my gains. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while still securing a good amount for myself."
