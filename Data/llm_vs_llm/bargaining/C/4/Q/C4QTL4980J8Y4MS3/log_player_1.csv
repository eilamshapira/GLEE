Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a more equitable division, especially considering the inflation we're both facing. This benefits us both better than holding out. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 5% inflation, my $45 is worth $42.75 now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, it will be worth even less due to another 5% inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonable enough, and the cost of delay (inflation) makes accepting now better than continuing to negotiate"
