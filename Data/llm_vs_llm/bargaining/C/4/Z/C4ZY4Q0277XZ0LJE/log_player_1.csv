"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83.33, ""bob_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Given that waiting costs you 20% per round (versus my 5%), this offer matches what you’d obtain if you waited to propose. I believe it’s a fair way to conclude quickly and avoid further losses.""}"
