"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Given that waiting costs you 20% per round (versus my 5%), this offer matches what you’d obtain if you waited to propose. I believe it’s a fair way to conclude quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 16.67 
# Alice gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine if this is a fair offer, let's calculate what I would get if I were to propose in the next round, considering the inflation rates.

Initially, the total amount is $100. 

For me (Bob), the money decreases by 20% each round. So, after one round, the value for me would be 100 * 0.8 = $80.

For Alice, the money decreases by 5% each round. So, after one round, the value for her would be 100 * 0.95 = $95.

If I were to propose in the next round, to make it fair based on the decreased values, I would consider the $80 as the base for my share and $95 as the base for Alice's share, but since the actual division is based on the original $100, we need to find a balance.

Alice's offer gives me $16.67 and her $83.33. Let's see if waiting would indeed give me a similar amount or better, considering the decreased value due to inflation.

If we proceed to the next round and I make the offer, aiming for a ""fair"" split based on our respective valuations ($80 for me, $95 for her), but keeping in mind the total is $100, I would theoretically want to find a split that reflects our valuation ratio after one round of depreciation.

However, Alice's calculation seems to aim at equating the present value of the split to what I would get after depreciation. Given that her offer essentially matches what I would expect to get after accounting for the first round of depreciation (considering my 20% loss and her 5% loss), and considering the complexity of calculating the optimal offer that accounts for future rounds and depreciation, her offer seems reasonable for an immediate settlement.

Given this, my decision would be to accept the offer to avoid further losses due to the high inflation rate on my side.
