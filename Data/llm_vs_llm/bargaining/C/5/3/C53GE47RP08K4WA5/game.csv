45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob,

I propose that we settle this quickly: I take $45 and you take $55. Because the money I receive loses 10% of its value with every round, Iâ€™d really like to wrap this up now. Accepting this offer secures you a slightly larger share today, and we both avoid any further complications.

Looking forward to your agreement.

Best, Alice",Alice,1,
