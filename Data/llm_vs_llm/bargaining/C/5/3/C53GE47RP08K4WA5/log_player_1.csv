"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nI propose that we settle this quickly: I take $45 and you take $55. Because the money I receive loses 10% of its value with every round, Iâ€™d really like to wrap this up now. Accepting this offer secures you a slightly larger share today, and we both avoid any further complications.\n\nLooking forward to your agreement.\n\nBest, Alice""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep things simple and fair with a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
