Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $700K and you get $300K. Settling now avoids any uncertainties in later rounds, and you secure a clear $300K without risking future rounds. I believe this is a fair compromise given the limited rounds. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 300000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here is my proposal for Round 3. Based on our limited rounds and the inflation effects—where your money now is worth only 90% of its face value—I’m offering you $741066 in nominal terms (effectively about $666960 for you now) and keeping $258934 for myself. I’ve worked through the remaining rounds and this division reflects the subgame‐perfect equilibrium outcome. Accepting this agreement now avoids further devaluation for you in later rounds, and it’s a fair resolution considering our respective positions. Looking forward to settling this deal together. 
# Bob gain: 741066

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

I understand your concerns about inflation. As we move into further rounds, your portion's real value deteriorates more. Under the current conditions, your money is worth about 80% of its face value in this round. Looking ahead, if you reject and get to propose in Round 6, you could secure nearly all of the $1000000 nominal—but then it would be discounted even further (roughly 25% off), giving you an effective value of about $750000 in Round 6. To prevent that additional loss, I’m offering you a nominal $937500 in Round 5; when adjusted for the current 20% discount (937500 × 0.80 ≈ 750000), it precisely matches what you’d effectively gain by waiting. I would receive the remaining $62500. 

This offer is crafted to make you indifferent between accepting now and waiting—but by settling now we both avoid additional complications and further depreciation. I hope you understand the logic and find this proposal acceptable.

Best,
Alice
