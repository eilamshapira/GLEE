Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division of the $10,000 that acknowledges our different inflation rates.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose money with each round, let's end this quickly. I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates - you lose 20% per round while I lose 10%. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing this difference. Let's avoid inflation eating into our total.""}"
