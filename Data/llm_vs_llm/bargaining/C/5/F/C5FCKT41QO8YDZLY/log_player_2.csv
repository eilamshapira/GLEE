"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose money with each round, let's end this quickly. I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates - you lose 20% per round while I lose 10%. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing this difference. Let's avoid inflation eating into our total. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $4500 for me, $5500 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 20% less to me (only $8000 effective value)
   * And 10% less to Alice ($9000 effective value)

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"" at first glance, Alice makes a valid point about our different inflation rates. If I reject, I'll have less total value to work with in the next round due to the higher inflation rate affecting me.

$4500 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation. Even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, Alice would likely reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
