"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob knows that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for him (10% per round), he might be tempted to reject early offers. However, both of us lose value by delaying, so there's incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

I'll propose a split that's weighted in Bob's favor to increase the likelihood of acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

This gives Bob a generous 60% of the total amount while still securing a significant portion for myself. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to the next round where both of us would lose value."
