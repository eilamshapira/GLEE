"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 by giving you $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself. This offer is made with the current round in mind, and I believe it's a fair starting point given the uncertainties around inflation effects. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. Given the impact of inflation with each round, I propose we each take $5000 to ensure a fair split. This way, we both secure a substantial amount before any further devaluation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the continued negotiation only further devalues your share while mine remains unaffected. Considering that if you hold out you’d likely end up with almost nothing in a future counteroffer, I’m offering you $1 now—enough for you to be better off than risking further devaluation. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, understanding the devaluation effects on my share, I'd like to propose $6400 for myself and $3600 for you. This new offer accounts for my inflation losses in previous rounds. It's important to balance the current value with fairness, and I hope this can be a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that with each round the value of your share deteriorates further due to inflation. Waiting only means that the money you eventually receive will be worth significantly less. With this in mind, I’m proposing a settlement now: you'll get $7,000 in nominal dollars (which, while subject to inflation, is still higher than previous offers), and I’ll take $3,000—my share remains at full value. This offer aims to give you a better nominal position compared to any future round where further devaluation is likely. I hope you see the benefit of locking in this deal immediately.""}"
