"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 by giving you $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself. This offer is made with the current round in mind, and I believe it's a fair starting point given the uncertainties around inflation effects. Looking forward to your thoughts!

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. Given the impact of inflation with each round, I propose we each take $5000 to ensure a fair split. This way, we both secure a substantial amount before any further devaluation. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the continued negotiation only further devalues your share while mine remains unaffected. Considering that if you hold out you’d likely end up with almost nothing in a future counteroffer, I’m offering you $1 now—enough for you to be better off than risking further devaluation. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle immediately. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, understanding the devaluation effects on my share, I'd like to propose $6400 for myself and $3600 for you. This new offer accounts for my inflation losses in previous rounds. It's important to balance the current value with fairness, and I hope this can be a mutually agreeable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that with each round the value of your share deteriorates further due to inflation. Waiting only means that the money you eventually receive will be worth significantly less. With this in mind, I’m proposing a settlement now: you'll get $7000 in nominal dollars (which, while subject to inflation, is still higher than previous offers), and I’ll take $3000—my share remains at full value. This offer aims to give you a better nominal position compared to any future round where further devaluation is likely. I hope you see the benefit of locking in this deal immediately. 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000
