"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if this goes to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I suggest I get $52 and Bob gets $48. This is close to an even split but slightly in my favor to protect against potential inflation losses if Bob declines. It's a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept this offer, I get $45, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $42.75 to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any money I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
* Even if I propose a higher split in my favor next round, Bob might reject again, leading to further inflation penalties for me

Given these factors, while this isn't an ideal split, accepting now is better than risking further inflation losses.
