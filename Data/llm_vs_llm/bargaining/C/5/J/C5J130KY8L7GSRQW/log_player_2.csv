"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $48 and keeping $52 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. My money value doesn't decrease

Since Alice's money will be worth less next round, I can likely negotiate a better deal. $52 will only be worth about $49.40 to her next round, so she might be more willing to accept a different split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's value of money decreases by 5% each round, I should propose an offer that's favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept (rather than moving to another round where her money would be worth even less).

$52 from the previous round would now be worth $49.40 to her. I can use this to my advantage but shouldn't be too greedy.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a better deal than the previous round
2. For Alice, $45 now is better than potentially getting less value in the next round due to the 5% depreciation
3. It's still a reasonable offer that doesn't appear too greedy"
