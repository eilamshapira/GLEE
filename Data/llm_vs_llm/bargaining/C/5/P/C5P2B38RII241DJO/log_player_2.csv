"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
- This is a 40-60 split in her favor
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less
- Current value for me: $4,000
- Next round value: $3,800 (5% less)
- I still have 11 rounds left

While this isn't an equal split, it's a reasonable first offer. If I reject, I risk further devaluation and potential deadlock. I could counter with a better offer, but Alice might reject, leading to more rounds and inflation.
