Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm a bit more sensitive to the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
