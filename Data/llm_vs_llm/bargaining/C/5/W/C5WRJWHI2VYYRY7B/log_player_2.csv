"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $350,000 out of $1,000,000
2. This is 35% of the total amount
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
5. $350,000 now is better than potentially getting $400,000 that's worth 5% less

While the split isn't entirely fair, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive than risking a negotiation that might drag on.
