"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division considering that:
1. I want a favorable split since I'm making the first offer
2. The 60-40 split is not too greedy and gives Bob a reasonable amount
3. With inflation affecting future rounds, it's better to secure a good deal early"
