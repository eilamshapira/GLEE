60.0,40.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and will leave us both happy.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I'd like to end our game swiftly to avoid any risks from unpredictable inflation. I propose a split where I receive $55 and you get $45. While it slightly favors me, agreeing now ensures we both secure immediate value rather than risk future reductions. I hope you'll see the benefit of concluding our deal promptly. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your desire for a swift resolution, but your previous offer wasn't quite balanced. This split is more in line with a fair division considering the potential impact of inflation on both of us.  Let's settle this now and avoid further reductions.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I see that the current offer gives me $45, which remains fully valued. However, by moving to the next round as the proposer, I can craft an offer that secures a better share for me while keeping the pressing issue of inflation in mind. Therefore, I must decline your proposal.",Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but with every round that passes, your share loses value while mine remains unchanged. By settling now with a division of $60 to me and $40 to you, you avoid further erosion of your portion. Let's finalize this deal before any additional inflation takes its toll.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's end this on a fair and equal note with a 50/50 split. This ensures we both walk away with a reasonable share, regardless of how inflation might affect us in future rounds.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I appreciate the effort to keep things even, but considering that your share loses value with each round while mine remains stable, I believe we can do even better for both of us if we act now. I'd prefer to propose a revised split in the next round that reflects this dynamic advantage and helps us both avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's continue the negotiation.",Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, with each round that passes, the negative impact of inflation on your share becomes even more pronounced. I recognize your concerns about fairness, but given that my portion remains unaffected while yours continues to erode, it's in both our interests to settle now. I’m offering a division where I receive $65 and you receive $35—this minimizes further loss on your end and secures immediate, albeit adjusted, value for both of us. Let’s conclude this deal before the situation worsens further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but your demands are becoming unreasonable.  This offer recognizes the impact of inflation, but it also ensures I receive a fair share.  It's time to be realistic and finalize this.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, your current offer gives me $55—full value—but leaves you with only $45, which when adjusted for inflation is worth significantly less. I believe that by taking the next turn as proposer, I can craft an offer that better recognizes the dynamics at play and avoids locking in such a steep discount for you. Therefore, I must decline your proposal in favor of further negotiations.",Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of your share due to inflation, while mine stays intact. In this round, I'm offering a 70/30 split. Accepting this deal now ensures you lock in as much value as possible before further devaluation hits. I believe this is our best path forward—let's settle and conclude the game now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, I understand the situation with inflation, and I'm willing to adjust my position. This offer secures a significant portion for you while still providing me with a reasonable share. Let's close this deal now and avoid any further complications from inflation.",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to adjust, your current offer only gives me $60. Considering that I'm in control of my share and that your portion continues to depreciate due to inflation, I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome by proposing my own division in the next round. Let's continue negotiating in hopes of finding a more optimal settlement.",Bob,9,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, as we move deeper into the rounds, the inflation greatly diminishes the real value of your share—even more than before. I’m proposing a split of $75 for me and $25 for you to secure what remains of your value right now. Accepting this offer today means you lock in your share before further rounds erode its worth even more. Let's resolve this soon before the situation worsens any further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
35.0,65.0,"Bob, this is a critical point in our negotiation. I'm offering you a favorable split, recognizing the impact of inflation, but I need you to be realistic as well. This offer is my final attempt to reach a fair agreement. Let's end this now.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. However, given that your share is now significantly devalued by inflation, I believe I can secure an even more favorable outcome by being the proposer in the final round. Waiting to present my offer in Round 12 offers me a strategic advantage that I cannot pass up. Let's proceed to the last round and see if we can wrap this up then.",Bob,11,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, this is our final round—if we don't settle now, we both walk away with nothing. Considering how inflation has further diminished the value of your share in every round, I'm offering you $20, which, even accounting for the current devaluation, is something rather than nothing. I urge you to accept this final proposal so we can both secure what remains of our value.",Bob,12,
