"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of the money over time. I'll make a reasonable offer to Bob to increase the likelihood of him accepting.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze.

*   **My Perspective:** My gain is now worth 90% of the original value.
*   **Bob's Offer:** I would receive $450,000.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer: $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000

I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is making this tricky. My money is now worth 81% (90% of 90%) of its original value. I need to make an offer that's attractive to Bob, but also ensures I get a decent amount considering the declining value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
