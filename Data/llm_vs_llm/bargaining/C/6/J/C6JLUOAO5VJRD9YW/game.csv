600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm offering you a fair 40%. Consider that your money loses value much faster than mine with each round (20% vs 5%). If you reject, your next offer will already be worth less to you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a bit more. If you reject, your next offer will be worth less to both of us, but more significantly to me. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation rate on your side, your $350000 now is actually better than getting $400000 two rounds ago. Further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us, but especially for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but I'm not ready to settle for less than half yet. My offer is still relatively generous considering the initial amount. Remember, if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be rational about this. Due to your 20% per round inflation, your $300000 now is worth about the same as $580000 was in your last offer. Each round that passes dramatically reduces your purchasing power more than mine. This offer actually preserves more value for you than continuing to negotiate. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
