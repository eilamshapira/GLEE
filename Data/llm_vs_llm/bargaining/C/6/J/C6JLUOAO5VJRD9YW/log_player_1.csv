"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fair 40%. Consider that your money loses value much faster than mine with each round (20% vs 5%). If you reject, your next offer will already be worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a bit more. If you reject, your next offer will be worth less to both of us, but more significantly to me. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $427,500 to me now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth another 5% less to me
   - And 20% less to Bob, significantly weakening his position
3. Bob's current split (55/45) isn't terribly unfair, but I can probably do better
4. However, prolonging the negotiation reduces the value for both of us

Despite this reasonable offer, given Bob's much higher inflation rate, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's money has already depreciated by 36% (20% compound over two rounds) while mine only by about 10% (5% compound), I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation rate on your side, your $350,000 now is actually better than getting $400,000 two rounds ago. Further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us, but especially for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but I'm not ready to settle for less than half yet. My offer is still relatively generous considering the initial amount. Remember, if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $420,000, which due to 14.26% inflation is worth about $360,108 to me now
2. Bob's portion ($580,000) is worth only about $297,000 to him due to 48.8% inflation
3. We're now 4 rounds in, with 8 remaining
4. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth ~19% less to me and ~59% less to Bob
   - Bob's bargaining position is weakening significantly due to his higher inflation rate
5. The 58/42 split in Bob's favor seems poor given the inflation dynamics

Given that Bob's money is depreciating much faster and we still have 8 rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's money now worth less than half its original value, while mine has depreciated much less, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational about this. Due to your 20% per round inflation, your $300,000 now is worth about the same as $580,000 was in your last offer. Each round that passes dramatically reduces your purchasing power more than mine. This offer actually preserves more value for you than continuing to negotiate. Let's conclude this now.""}"
