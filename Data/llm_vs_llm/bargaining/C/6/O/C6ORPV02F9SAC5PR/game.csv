7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away—with you receiving $2857 and I receiving $7143. Given that any delay devalues the total amount (10% for me and 20% for you per round), accepting now is in both our best interests. I believe this is the fair, equilibrium split considering our respective future discounts. What do you say?",Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand we both lose value with each round, but your initial offer was too skewed in your favor. This proposal is more equitable while still giving you the majority share to account for your stronger long-term position. If we continue to the next round, we both lose significantly - you'll only have $9000 worth of value to split and I'll have even less at $8000. Let's agree now and both walk away with a fair amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a fair division, but I believe that if we continue to the next round—where I'll have the privilege of proposing with a comparatively smaller discount factor—I can secure a division that better reflects the long‐term value for me. Hence, I must reject this offer. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
7130.0,2870.0,"Hi Bob, given the rapid depreciation with each delay, I’ve adjusted my proposal to reflect our respective discount factors. In this round, every dollar for me is worth 0.81 of its nominal value and for you 0.64. If you reject, you’d propose in round 4—obtaining roughly 35.7% of the pie but at an even steeper discount. To secure your position, I’m offering you $2870, which nets you about $1837 in round‐3 effective value—marginally better than waiting. I’ll receive $7130. Please, let’s agree now before further delay erodes our returns.",Alice,3,
