"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away—with you receiving $2857 and I receiving $7143. Given that any delay devalues the total amount (10% for me and 20% for you per round), accepting now is in both our best interests. I believe this is the fair, equilibrium split considering our respective future discounts. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer and our positions in this game.

Alice is offering me $2857 while taking $7143 for herself, claiming this is the equilibrium split considering our different discount rates.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice.

Let me analyze this: If I reject, in the next round the $10,000 would be worth $8,000 to me and $9,000 to Alice. This puts me at a disadvantage if negotiations drag on.

Looking at Alice's proposed split, I'm getting only about 28.6% of the total. While my bargaining position weakens more quickly than Alice's with each round, this first offer seems too skewed in her favor.

I believe I can improve my position by making a counter-offer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers our different discount rates while being fair enough that Alice will accept rather than continuing to the next round.

If Alice rejects my offer, the money in round 3 would be worth 80% of the original value to her (90% of 90%) and 64% to me (80% of 80%). This difference in discount rates gives her a stronger position if negotiations continue, but I can use the immediate round to my advantage.

I'll propose a more balanced split that still acknowledges our different positions.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we both lose value with each round, but your initial offer was too skewed in your favor. This proposal is more equitable while still giving you the majority share to account for your stronger long-term position. If we continue to the next round, we both lose significantly - you'll only have $9,000 worth of value to split and I'll have even less at $8,000. Let's agree now and both walk away with a fair amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the rapid depreciation with each delay, I’ve adjusted my proposal to reflect our respective discount factors. In this round, every dollar for me is worth 0.81 of its nominal value and for you 0.64. If you reject, you’d propose in round 4—obtaining roughly 35.7% of the pie but at an even steeper discount. To secure your position, I’m offering you $2870, which nets you about $1837 in round‐3 effective value—marginally better than waiting. I’ll receive $7130. Please, let’s agree now before further delay erodes our returns. 
# Bob gain: 2870 
# Alice gain: 7130 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in the context of our diminishing returns.

Alice is offering me $2870, which she notes is worth $1837 in effective value to me after the 36% depreciation. Meanwhile, she would get $7130, worth about $5775 to her after her 19% depreciation.

If I reject and we move to round 4, my money would be worth 49% less than the original value (an additional 20% discount), while Alice's would be worth 27% less (an additional 10% discount). This means our bargaining positions continue to diverge in Alice's favor.

Alice's offer has barely improved from her first proposal ($2857 → $2870). Given our asymmetric discount rates, I would have expected a more significant improvement.

However, if I reject and make another offer in round 4, Alice could reject again, and we'd end up in an even worse position by round 5.

Considering the rapidly deteriorating value to me with each round, and the relatively minor improvements I might achieve with further negotiation against a strong opponent with better discount rates, I'll accept this offer.
