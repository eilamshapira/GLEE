"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""I propose to take the larger share since I believe this is a fair starting point. Letâ€™s split it with me getting 80%.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair - I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and considering the inflation effect on my side, this is reasonable. We can both walk away with a good amount if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
