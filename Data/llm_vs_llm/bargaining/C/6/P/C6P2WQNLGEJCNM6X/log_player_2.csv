"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take the larger share since I believe this is a fair starting point. Letâ€™s split it with me getting 80%. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is proposing I get $200,000 while she gets $800,000, which is an 80-20 split in her favor.

Given that:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round when I make a counter-offer
2. $200,000 now is worth more than $200,000 in future rounds due to inflation
3. I still have 11 more rounds if needed
4. An 80-20 split is quite unfavorable for me

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 20% inflation. I should be able to propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that we both need to reach an agreement and that inflation affects my gains.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair - I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and considering the inflation effect on my side, this is reasonable. We can both walk away with a good amount if you accept.""}"
