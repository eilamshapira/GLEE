55.0,45.0,"Hello Bob, I propose a split of $55 to me and $45 to you. This division helps cushion me against the inflation risk over time while still offering you a fair share. Let me know your thoughts on proceeding with this offer.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the risk of inflation. This ensures both of us get a good share, especially considering we only have 12 rounds.",Bob,2,

14.0,86.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the cost of waiting increases our losses due to inflation. In round 4, you’d be in the proposer’s seat but your money would be worth only 60% of nominal, whereas here in round 3 you’d get 70% of the nominal amount. By offering you $86 nominal (which is 86 × 0.7 ≈ 60.2 in effective value), I’m giving you just a bit more than what you could secure by waiting. I believe this split is fair given the steepening inflation, so I hope you’ll accept this proposal.",Alice,3,
