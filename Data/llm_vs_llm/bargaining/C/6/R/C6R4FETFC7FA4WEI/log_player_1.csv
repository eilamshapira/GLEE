"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I propose a split of $55 to me and $45 to you. This division helps cushion me against the inflation risk over time while still offering you a fair share. Let me know your thoughts on proceeding with this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the risk of inflation. This ensures both of us get a good share, especially considering we only have 12 rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 14, ""bob_gain"": 86, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the cost of waiting increases our losses due to inflation. In round 4, you’d be in the proposer’s seat but your money would be worth only 60% of nominal, whereas here in round 3 you’d get 70% of the nominal amount. By offering you $86 nominal (which is 86 × 0.7 ≈ 60.2 in effective value), I’m giving you just a bit more than what you could secure by waiting. I believe this split is fair given the steepening inflation, so I hope you’ll accept this proposal.""}"
