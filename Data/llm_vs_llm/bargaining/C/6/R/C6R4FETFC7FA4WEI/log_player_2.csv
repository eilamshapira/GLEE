"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I propose a split of $55 to me and $45 to you. This division helps cushion me against the inflation risk over time while still offering you a fair share. Let me know your thoughts on proceeding with this offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the risk of inflation. This ensures both of us get a good share, especially considering we only have 12 rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the cost of waiting increases our losses due to inflation. In round 4, you’d be in the proposer’s seat but your money would be worth only 60% of nominal, whereas here in round 3 you’d get 70% of the nominal amount. By offering you $86 nominal (which is 86 × 0.7 ≈ 60.2 in effective value), I’m giving you just a bit more than what you could secure by waiting. I believe this split is fair given the steepening inflation, so I hope you’ll accept this proposal. 
# Bob gain: 86 
# Alice gain: 14
