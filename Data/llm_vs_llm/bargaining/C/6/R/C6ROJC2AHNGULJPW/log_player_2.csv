"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round. I'm sure you'll appreciate the gesture! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and 5% less for Alice, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

For me (Bob), the value of the money after 1 round is 80% of the original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.
For Alice, the value of the money after 1 round is 95% of the original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
