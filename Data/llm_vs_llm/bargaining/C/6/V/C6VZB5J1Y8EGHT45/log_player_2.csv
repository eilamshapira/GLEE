"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $40 out of $100, which is 40%. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 pot would effectively be worth $80 from my perspective.

If I reject, I could propose a better split in the next round, but even if I propose a very favorable split for myself (like 70/30), 70% of $80 (due to inflation) would be $56. Since Alice might reject that anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation...

$40 right now is probably better than risking further rounds with inflation eating away at the value.
