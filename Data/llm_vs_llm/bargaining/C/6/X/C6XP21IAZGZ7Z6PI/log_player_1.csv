"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I made the first move and took initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that every round decreases the overall value by 10%, waiting would only hurt both of us. I propose a fair division where I get $53 and you get $47, which reflects the current value of the money. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial offerâ€”please accept. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. He makes a valid point about inflation reducing value each round
2. While slightly in his favor, the 53-47 split is reasonably fair
3. Rejecting would mean both of us lose more value due to the 10% inflation in the next round
4. The difference between this and my initial proposal isn't worth the guaranteed loss from continuing"
