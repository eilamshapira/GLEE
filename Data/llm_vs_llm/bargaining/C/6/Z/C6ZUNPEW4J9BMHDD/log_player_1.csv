"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. If you reject, you'll already lose 5% value next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a good share while allowing me to mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round to avoid further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* My 4500$ is worth 4275$ (5% less) in real terms
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
* Getting 4275$ now is better than risking further depreciation
* While I'd prefer a better split, this is still a significant amount and avoiding another round of inflation is valuable
