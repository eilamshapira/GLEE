"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob already rejected a 70/30 split in my favor.  While the money is worth less now, his counter-offer of 75/25 suggests he's aiming for a larger share.  I'm hoping this offer might be on the edge of what he's willing to accept. 
* **Potential Loss:** If he rejects, the money will be worth significantly less in the next round, putting me in a weaker bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While Bob's offer is still tilted in his favor, accepting 80 dollars now is better than risking getting a smaller amount next round, which would be worth even less due to inflation."
