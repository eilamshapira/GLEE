"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the reduced value of money each round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. With 10% inflation, my $450,000 is now worth $405,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the 10% inflation in the next round would reduce my gains further
3. Bob's offer is reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in worse outcomes for me
4. The 55-45 split is not too far from my initial proposal, making it an acceptable compromise"
