"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. 

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning the entire $10,000 pot would be worth only $8,000 to me. In that next round, I would need to make a better proposal than what I'm currently being offered.

Since $4,000 is 40% of the total, and inflation would immediately reduce the value of the pot to me by 20%, I think I can do better by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing. Since I'm already facing 20% inflation in this round, I'll propose a division that gives me slightly more than half to compensate for this disadvantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a fair division considering that I'm facing inflation with each round. This offer gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to offset some of the value I've already lost due to inflation."
