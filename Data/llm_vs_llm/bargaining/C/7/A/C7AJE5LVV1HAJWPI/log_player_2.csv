"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair
- If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
- Even if I could get more in the next round, the 10% inflation penalty means I'd need to get at least 56$ to make it worthwhile
- Getting significantly more than 50$ might be difficult as Alice could reject

Given these factors, accepting 50$ now is better than risking a lower effective amount later.
