"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer is substantial, I believe there's room for a more equitable division. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is the fairest division that gives us both the same amount, and I hope Alice will see the value in an equitable arrangement."
