600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair starting point considering inflation will hit us hard if we delay. Let's settle this now!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand we're both facing inflation, though at different rates. A 50/50 split is the fairest division and allows us both to avoid further devaluation. Given that my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%), it's in both our interests to settle now without further delays.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I rejected your 50/50 offer. My inflation rate is lower, and I need to account for the losses from the previous rounds. I propose a 65/35 split. This is my best and final offer.",Alice,3,
