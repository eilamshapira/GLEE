"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both facing inflation, though at different rates. A 50/50 split is the fairest division and allows us both to avoid further devaluation. Given that my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%), it's in both our interests to settle now without further delays. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
