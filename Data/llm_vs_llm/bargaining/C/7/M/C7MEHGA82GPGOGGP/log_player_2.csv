"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair starting point considering inflation will hit us hard if we delay. Let's settle this now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully given the asymmetric inflation rates. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, while only 5% less to Alice.

If I counter-offer next round, the total $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me and $950,000 to Alice. This gives Alice a strong negotiating advantage as rounds progress.

The current offer gives me $400,000 now, which is less than half but avoids the inflation penalty. If I reject and we go multiple rounds, my negotiating position will weaken significantly due to the higher inflation rate affecting me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation pressures while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both facing inflation, though at different rates. A 50/50 split is the fairest division and allows us both to avoid further devaluation. Given that my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%), it's in both our interests to settle now without further delays.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your 50/50 offer. My inflation rate is lower, and I need to account for the losses from the previous rounds. I propose a 65/35 split. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer given the worsening inflation situation.

At this point, the money is worth 36% less to me than in round 1. If I reject, it will be worth 48.8% less in the next round (1-0.8^3). Meanwhile, Alice's inflation is much slower at 9.75% now.

The $350,000 offered to me now is actually worth only $224,000 compared to the original value in round 1 (350,000 Ã— 0.64). If I reject and counter-offer, any gains would be substantially devalued for me in the next round.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates strongly favoring Alice, and that further delays will weaken my position even more substantially, I should accept this offer.
