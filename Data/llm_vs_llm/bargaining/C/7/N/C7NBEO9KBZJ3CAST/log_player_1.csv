I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping to get Bob to accept quickly. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. While it's a much fairer split than the previous round, I still think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly less aggressive offer this time, hoping to find a compromise. I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm acknowledging that I need to offer something more to Bob to avoid another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm accepting this offer. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm not thrilled about only getting 550,000, but it's better than nothing.  I'm hoping I didn't lose too much by being so stubborn."
