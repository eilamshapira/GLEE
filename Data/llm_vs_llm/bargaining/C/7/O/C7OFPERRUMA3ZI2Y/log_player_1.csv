"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable division that benefits both parties equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $6,000 (but worth 20% less = $4,800 real value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But Bob's gains will be worth even less to him
   * This gives me some negotiating leverage

Since Bob's proposal gives me less than my initial fair split offer ($4,000 vs $5,000), and I know the money is worth less to him now, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money loses value each round and I know it's now worth 20% less to him, I'll adjust my offer to account for this strategic advantage while still remaining reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is still a fair offer considering that Bob's $4,500 is already devalued by 20% from his perspective. For him, it's worth $3,600 in round 1 terms, so he should be motivated to accept rather than risk further devaluation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4,500 (full value)
   * Bob gets $5,500 (but worth 48.8% less = $2,816 real value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * Bob's money will be worth even less to him
   * I have strong negotiating position due to the severe devaluation on Bob's side

This offer is better than his previous one ($4,500 vs $4,000), but given that Bob's money is now worth less than half of its original value, and I know I can make the next offer where his portion will be worth even less, I should negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money has significantly devalued (48.8% less valuable to him) and will continue to devalue, I can make a stronger proposal in my favor while still being rational for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I propose $6,500 for me and $3,500 for Bob. Here's why this is reasonable:
1. Bob's $3,500 is worth only about $1,792 to him due to the 48.8% devaluation
2. If he rejects, his share will be worth even less in the next round
3. He should be motivated to accept now rather than risk further devaluation

This offer provides me with a better outcome while still giving Bob an incentive to accept given his deteriorating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $5,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $5,000 (but worth 67.23% less = $1,638.50 real value for him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * Bob's money will be worth even less (probably around 80% less)
   * My negotiating position is extremely strong

This is Bob's most generous offer so far ($5,000), matching my initial proposal. However, given that:
1. Bob's share has severely devalued (worth only about $1,638.50 to him)
2. The trend suggests his future gains will be worth even less
3. I can make the next offer if I reject

I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money has severely devalued (67.23% less valuable) and will continue to devalue even further, I can make a stronger proposal in my favor as time pressure is significantly against Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I propose $7,500 for me and $2,500 for Bob. This is strategically sound because:
1. Bob's $2,500 is worth only about $819 to him due to the 67.23% devaluation
2. If he rejects, his share will be worth even less in the next round (likely over 75% devaluation)
3. Continuing to negotiate will only worsen his position
4. He should be strongly motivated to accept now rather than risk further massive devaluation

This offer maximizes my gain while still giving Bob a rational reason to accept, given his rapidly deteriorating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $6,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $4,000 (but worth 79.03% less = $838.80 real value for him)

2. This is Bob's best offer yet, and significantly better than his previous offers
3. While I could reject and potentially get more in the next round:
   * There's a risk of the negotiation breaking down
   * The $6,000 offer is quite good (60% of the total)
   * We've been negotiating for many rounds
   * Bob is showing willingness to compromise significantly

Given that this is a substantial improvement from previous offers, and considering the risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
