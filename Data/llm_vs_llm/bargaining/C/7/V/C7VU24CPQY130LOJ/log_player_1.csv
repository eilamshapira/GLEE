"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that I want to maximize my gain but also need Bob's acceptance to avoid further inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation
3. If Bob rejects, the 5% inflation will start affecting future rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. My $45 with 5% inflation means I'd effectively get $42.75
2. This is significantly less than my initial offer of $55
3. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but will face another 5% inflation
4. There's still plenty of rounds left, but each delay costs us both money
5. Bob's counter-offer essentially flipped my original proposal

Given that the inflation will continue to eat into both our gains and that this isn't a terrible offer (though not ideal), I will accept to secure a decent amount rather than risk further depreciation.
