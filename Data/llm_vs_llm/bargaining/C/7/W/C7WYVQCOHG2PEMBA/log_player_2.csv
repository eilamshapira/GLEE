"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split of the $100. On the surface, this seems fair.

However, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to the next round:
- For me (Bob), the money will be worth 20% less
- For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less

This means in the next round, we'd effectively be dividing $80 (my perspective) or $90 (Alice's perspective).

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I proposed taking all $100, I'd only get the equivalent of $80 in round 1 value. Alice would still be getting $0.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting the $50 now is better than rejecting and potentially getting less value in future rounds.
