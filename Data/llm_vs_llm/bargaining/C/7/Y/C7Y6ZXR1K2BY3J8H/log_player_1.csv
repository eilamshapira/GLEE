"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get $60 and you get $40. With inflation affecting future rounds, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think we can find something a bit more balanced, how about a 55/45 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of message):
This is a good time to accept because:
1. With 20% inflation already affecting my share, my $45 is effectively worth $36
2. Waiting another round would mean even more value loss
3. The split is reasonable, and continuing negotiations might lead to worse outcomes
4. There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer in future rounds"
