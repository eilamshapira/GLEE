"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's inflation rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I offer Bob $400,000 (40%) and keep $600,000 (60%) for myself. This is a fair offer considering that waiting will hurt Bob more than me due to the higher inflation rate he faces. If he rejects this, his money will be worth 20% less next round, while mine will only lose 5% of its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $550,000
   - With 5% inflation, it's actually worth: $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500

2. Bob keeps $450,000 for himself
   - With 20% inflation, it's worth: $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

This is actually a reasonable offer. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, the inflation would continue to affect both of us, and there's no guarantee I could get a significantly better deal. Bob is already taking a substantial hit due to his higher inflation rate.
