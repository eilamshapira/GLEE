"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I believe is fair for both of us. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty per round while you don't, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both our interests in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty makes accepting now better than continuing negotiations. If I reject and we go another round, my money would be worth even less, so this is a reasonable compromise."
