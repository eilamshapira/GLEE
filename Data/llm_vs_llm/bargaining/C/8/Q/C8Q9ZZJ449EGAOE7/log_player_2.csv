"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of $4000 for me and $6000 for her in Round 1.

If I reject and we go to Round 2, I could make a counter-offer, but I need to consider the 10% inflation that would affect my share. If I propose a better split for myself in Round 2, Alice might reject it, leading to Round 3 where inflation would further reduce the value of my share.

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about future rounds, I'll accept this offer now rather than risk losing value.
