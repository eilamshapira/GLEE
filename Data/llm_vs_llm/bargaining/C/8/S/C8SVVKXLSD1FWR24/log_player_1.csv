"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is close to an even split but slightly in my favor since I know I face 20% inflation per round if we don't agree quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $4,500 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $3,600
- If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but any amount will be worth another 20% less
- The longer this goes on, the less value I'll get due to inflation
- Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable given the circumstances

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty means I'm better off taking this deal now rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
