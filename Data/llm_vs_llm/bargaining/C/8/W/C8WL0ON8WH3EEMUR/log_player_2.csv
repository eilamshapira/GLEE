"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 2000$ and keeping 8000$ for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me next round
3. I'll have a chance to make a counter-offer
4. For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less next round
5. Given the high inflation rate for Alice (20%), I have negotiating leverage

This is a very uneven split (20/80). Given that Alice's money devalues much faster than mine, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), I should propose a more balanced split, but still leaving her with a decent amount so she's likely to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60/40 split which is much fairer than her initial 20/80 proposal. If she rejects, her share will be worth 20% less next round, while mine only 5% less, so she has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than drag out negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from 2000$ to 3600$ for me
2. The money is now worth:
   - For me: 3600$ × (1 - 0.0975) = 3249$
   - For Alice: 6400$ × (1 - 0.36) = 4096$

3. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 14.75% less than original
   - Alice's money will be worth 56% less than original
   - I can make another counter-offer

While Alice has moved significantly from her first offer, given the rapid depreciation of her value (20% per round vs my 5%), I believe I can still get a better deal. The large difference in our inflation rates gives me stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
1. Alice's money has already depreciated 36% and will depreciate another 20% if she rejects
2. My money has only depreciated 9.75% and will only depreciate another 5% if she rejects
3. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer from 2000 to 3600 for me

I'll propose a split that's slightly more in my favor than last time but still leaves Alice with a significant portion to incentivize acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

This 65/35 split acknowledges the time pressure Alice faces due to her higher inflation rate. If she rejects, her portion will be worth significantly less in the next round, while mine will only decrease slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has now offered an equal 50/50 split
2. The actual value after inflation:
   - For me: 5000$ × (1 - 0.1855) = 4072.50$
   - For Alice: 5000$ × (1 - 0.5904) = 2048$

3. This is a significant improvement from previous offers
4. If I reject:
   - My money will depreciate another 5% (to 23.55% total)
   - Alice's money will depreciate another 20% (to 79.04% total)
   - We're already 5 rounds in, with 7 remaining

Given that:
- Alice has moved to a fair 50/50 split
- The high inflation rate for Alice means further negotiations might lead to both of us getting less value
- We've reached a reasonable compromise
- The risk of continuing to negotiate might not be worth the potential gain
