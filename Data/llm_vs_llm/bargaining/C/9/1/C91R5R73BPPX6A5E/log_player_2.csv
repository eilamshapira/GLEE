"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my $40 would be worth $38 in the next round
4. There's also risk in negotiation - Alice might make worse offers later

Since $40 is a reasonable portion and inflation will reduce my gains if I wait, I'll accept this offer.
