Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle now to avoid any further loss in value. I propose a 55/45 split, which I believe balances our positions fairly given the risks of future rounds. I hope you'll agree that this offers both of us a better outcome than delaying further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
