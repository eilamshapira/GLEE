60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both facing inflation risks, and this equal division respects both our interests. Let's agree and finish this quickly so neither of us loses value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I need to compensate for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round vs your 5%). A 65-35 split would help balance this difference. If we keep rejecting offers, I'll lose much more value than you due to inflation. This is a fair adjustment considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about your higher inflation rate, but that actually means we need to reach an agreement quickly that's fair to both of us. Since you lose 20% per round and I only lose 5%, you have more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which acknowledges that we're currently in round 4 where your money has already lost significant value. If we continue negotiating, your gains will decrease even more dramatically than mine. This is our best opportunity for mutual benefit.",Bob,4,
