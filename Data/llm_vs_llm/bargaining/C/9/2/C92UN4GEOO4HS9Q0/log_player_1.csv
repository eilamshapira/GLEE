"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both facing inflation risks, and this equal division respects both our interests. Let's agree and finish this quickly so neither of us loses value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, $50 is now worth only $40 to me.
In contrast, my previous offer of $60 would have been worth $60.

Even though Bob is offering an equal split, due to the higher inflation rate I face, this isn't as favorable for me as it appears.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to compensate for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round vs your 5%). A 65-35 split would help balance this difference. If we keep rejecting offers, I'll lose much more value than you due to inflation. This is a fair adjustment considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about your higher inflation rate, but that actually means we need to reach an agreement quickly that's fair to both of us. Since you lose 20% per round and I only lose 5%, you have more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which acknowledges that we're currently in round 4 where your money has already lost significant value. If we continue negotiating, your gains will decrease even more dramatically than mine. This is our best opportunity for mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully...

In round 4, my inflation means I would get:
$45 * (1 - 0.488) = $23.04 in round 1 value

If I reject and we continue:
- My inflation will become even worse (next round would be about 60% less value)
- Bob is correct that I have more to lose due to my higher inflation rate
- The gap between our inflation rates means my negotiating position weakens each round
- Bob is clearly aware of this dynamic and is using it strategically

While I don't love getting less than half, Bob's reasoning is sound. If I reject, my position will only get worse, and the effective value I receive will likely be even lower in future rounds.
