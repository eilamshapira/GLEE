"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically about this offer. Alice is asking for a 60-40 split in her favor, which means I'd get $40.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 5% inflation, so my money would be worth 5% less. However, I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself. If I were to get, say, $50 in the next round, that would be worth $47.50 after inflation, which is better than accepting $40 now.

Since this is just the first round and we have 12 rounds total, I think I can try to negotiate for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation concern.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both facing inflation risks, and this equal division respects both our interests. Let's agree and finish this quickly so neither of us loses value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to compensate for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round vs your 5%). A 65-35 split would help balance this difference. If we keep rejecting offers, I'll lose much more value than you due to inflation. This is a fair adjustment considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice something important here - Alice has revealed that her inflation rate is much higher (20% per round) compared to my 5% per round. This actually gives me negotiating leverage, since she's more pressured to reach an agreement quickly.

Her current offer gives me $35, which after 9.75% inflation is worth about $31.59 to me. This is worse than her first offer, and now I know she's facing much higher inflation pressure. 

Since she's losing 20% per round, it makes strategic sense for me to negotiate further, as she should be more willing to compromise as her potential gains decrease more rapidly than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about your higher inflation rate, but that actually means we need to reach an agreement quickly that's fair to both of us. Since you lose 20% per round and I only lose 5%, you have more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which acknowledges that we're currently in round 4 where your money has already lost significant value. If we continue negotiating, your gains will decrease even more dramatically than mine. This is our best opportunity for mutual benefit.""}"
