"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money loses value faster (20% vs my 10% per round), this split is actually favorable for you. If you reject, your share will be worth much less next round. Let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
