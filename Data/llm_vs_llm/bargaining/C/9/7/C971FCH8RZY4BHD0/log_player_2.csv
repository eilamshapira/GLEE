"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current split: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

If I reject, in the next round:
* My $4,500 would become worth $4,050
* Alice's $5,500 would become worth $4,400

Since Alice will lose more value due to her higher inflation rate (20%), I have leverage to make a better offer in the next round. Also, this first offer is giving Alice more than half, which doesn't seem fair given our inflation rates.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses value faster (20% vs my 10% per round), this split is actually favorable for you. If you reject, your share will be worth much less next round. Let's agree now and both benefit.""}

Reasoning: I'm offering Alice $4,800 which, even with 20% inflation if she rejects, would be worth less ($3,840) in the next round. Meanwhile, my $5,200 would only decrease to $4,680 due to 10% inflation. This makes accepting now the rational choice for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Given the inflation rates, this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $5,000 each, but due to inflation:
   * My $5,000 is actually worth $4,050 (19% less)
   * Alice's $5,000 is worth $3,200 (36% less)

2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My money will lose another 10% (total 29% from original)
   * Alice's money will lose another 20% (total 56% from original)
   * My turn to propose again

This is actually a decent offer because:
1. I'm getting a fair 50-50 split
2. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, but she's still willing to do even split
3. Further delays will hurt both of us significantly
