"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, a good offer for you before inflation kicks in further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $4000, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3).

To make an attractive offer to Bob, I'll give him a bit more than half. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, inflation is eating away at my share""
}
```"
