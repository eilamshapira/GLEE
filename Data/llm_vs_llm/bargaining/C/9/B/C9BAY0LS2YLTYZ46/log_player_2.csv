"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, a good offer for you before inflation kicks in further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a reasonable split, inflation is eating away at my share 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking the deal now makes sense. While not ideal, it's better than risking further inflation eating into potential gains, especially since I don't know how much it's truly affecting Alice."
