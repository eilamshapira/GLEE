"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while taking $6,000 for herself. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the whole pot is effectively worth $9,000 to me.

If I counter-offer in round 2, I'd want more than $4,000. But if Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd move to round 3 with further inflation reducing the value to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I should make a fair offer that considers both the inflation I'm facing and the need to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, which is a standard solution in many bargaining problems. The equal split respects fairness norms while giving me a better outcome than Alice's initial proposal. Since I'm the one facing known inflation, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reassess the situation with the new information about Alice's inflation rate. Now I know that Alice is also facing inflation, and at a higher rate than me (36% vs. 19% after two rounds). This means she also has incentives to reach an agreement sooner.

Alice has slightly improved her offer from $4,000 to $4,200 for me. With 19% inflation for me, $4,200 is now worth about $3,402 in round 1 terms. My previous rejection was when I was offered $4,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject again, we go to round 4, where inflation would further reduce the value for both of us. Given the high inflation rate for Alice, she might be more willing to offer a better deal in the next round, but we're also losing value with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now I understand that Alice faces even higher inflation than I do (36% vs 19% after two rounds), which gives me some negotiating leverage. I need to make an offer that's favorable to me but still acceptable to Alice given our respective inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a better offer for Alice than my previous 50-50 split when considering her higher inflation rate. If she rejects this offer and we go to round 5, the money will be worth even less to both of us, with hers deteriorating faster. This should create pressure for her to accept a reasonable offer now, and I believe this division acknowledges both our positions while being favorable enough to me to compensate for the rejected offers so far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this situation. Alice's inflation rate is significantly higher than mine (59.04% vs. 34.39% after four rounds). 

Alice has increased her offer to me to $4,400. With my 34.39% inflation, this $4,400 is worth about $2,887 in round 1 terms. This is less than the $4,000 she initially offered in real value.

Meanwhile, Alice's $5,600 is only worth about $2,294 to her in round 1 terms due to her 59.04% inflation rate.

Given that:
1) We've already gone through 5 rounds
2) We only have 7 more rounds before we both get nothing
3) Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine
4) The total pie is shrinking rapidly for both of us

I should consider accepting this offer since rejection means further value erosion for both of us, and Alice is already feeling significant pressure from her high inflation rate.
