"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I believe this is a fair start to our negotiation. Let's agree early and avoid the risks of multiple rounds for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically. She's offering me $4000 out of $10,000, which means I would get 40% of the total amount. While this is a substantial sum, it's less than half, and since I'm the first one to respond, I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round.

Given that we have 12 rounds total, I can afford to negotiate for a more equitable split. By rejecting this offer, I can propose a more balanced distribution in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both get $5000, and neither of us needs to feel disadvantaged. This is the most equitable arrangement, and I hope you'll agree.""}"
