7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away given the cost of delay. I suggest that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. This split considers the fact that with each round the overall money loses value—10% for me and 20% for you—so waiting hurts more. I believe this offer reflects our respective time‐preferences and is fair for both of us. Let’s agree and conclude the division.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the depreciation rates, I propose a more balanced split. While you offered me only 28.6%, I'm offering you 45% which is still substantial. This split better reflects the fair value for both of us, and accepting now prevents further depreciation affecting both our shares.",Bob,2,

9048.0,952.0,"Hi Bob,

I understand the stakes with the decreasing value each round. In round 3 the nominal amounts we’re splitting still sum to $10000, but due to depreciation you effectively get only 60% of your nominal share and I get 80% of mine. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4, but then the discount for you will be even harsher (only 40% of any nominal amount), and by backward reasoning you’d only secure roughly an effective $570. To avoid further loss, I’m offering you $952 nominal—which gives you an effective value of about $571 (952 × 0.6)—exactly matching your continuation value. This way, you lock in the best you can expect from waiting, while I secure the larger remaining share (9048 nominal, 9048 × 0.8 ≈ $7238 effective).

I believe this is the most efficient outcome for both of us considering the inflation penalty. I hope you’ll agree to conclude the deal now.",Alice,3,
