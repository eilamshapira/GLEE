"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer gives me $4,000 and Alice $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation for me, the money will be worth less next round
4. $4,000 now vs. potentially more but worth less later...
5. This is a 40/60 split, which isn't terrible but not great either

Given that my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Alice's (5%), I should be more eager to conclude early. However, this first offer is a bit too favorable to Alice. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 2, I need to consider that:
1. The money is now worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice
2. I should make a reasonable offer to increase chances of acceptance
3. A fair split considering the inflation difference might be slightly in my favor

I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since I'm affected by higher inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a 55/45 split which is more favorable than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable enough that she might accept it considering the inflation penalty we both face if we continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice offered me $4,300, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $3,483 to me
2. If I reject, my next offer will face even more inflation (29% for me, 14.75% for Alice)
3. Alice's first offer was $4,000, and now she's offering $4,300 - she's making small concessions
4. The inflation is hitting me harder than Alice, weakening my bargaining position
5. Further rounds will continue to erode the value more significantly for me than for Alice

While this isn't an ideal split, the increasing inflation differential means my position will only get worse. The relatively small improvement I might get in future rounds would likely be offset by the inflation loss.
