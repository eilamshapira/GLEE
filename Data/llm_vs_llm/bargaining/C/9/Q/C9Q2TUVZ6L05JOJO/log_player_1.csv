"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share, and there's no advantage to either of us. Consider the impact of inflation if you reject this offer, and you might get less in the following rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I wait another round, my share would be worth 20% less again
2. A 50-50 split is fair, and getting $5000 now (worth $4000 after my 20% inflation) is better than risking further rounds where my purchasing power would continue to decrease
3. The next round would mean even more value lost to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better offer
4. Bob could become more aggressive in future rounds knowing I'm under more inflation pressure than he is"
