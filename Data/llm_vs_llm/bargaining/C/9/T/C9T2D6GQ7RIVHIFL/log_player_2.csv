"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make a counter-offer
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice
- My $400,000 would become worth $320,000 to me
- Alice's $600,000 would become worth $540,000 to her

3. Even if I make a better offer next round, the significant devaluation would likely make it worse for me than accepting now.

4. While the split isn't 50-50, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further devaluation.
