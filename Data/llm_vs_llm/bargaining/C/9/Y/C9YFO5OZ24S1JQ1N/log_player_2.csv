"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, money will be worth 5% less for me next round
4. For Alice, it will be worth 20% less, which puts me in a stronger position

I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer, since Alice's money devalues faster than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since money devalues faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I have a stronger negotiating position. However, I shouldn't be too greedy as we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is a fair offer considering:
1. Alice's money devalues faster than mine
2. She needs to decide quickly to avoid bigger losses
3. It's still early in the game, giving her a decent amount
4. It's more balanced than her initial offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice only slightly improved her offer from $40 to $42
2. Due to inflation, my $42 is actually worth $37.91 (9.75% less)
3. Alice's $58 is worth only $37.12 (36% less)
4. Alice seems to be negotiating quite stubbornly despite her worse inflation rate
5. However, with each round, both of us are losing value
6. We still have 9 rounds left, but continuing too long will hurt both of us

Since Alice made such a small concession despite her higher inflation rate, I believe I can still get a better deal by making another counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me strategize:
1. We're in round 4, so my money is worth about 15% less, and Alice's is worth about 56% less
2. Alice has been relatively stubborn, only moving from 40 to 42 for my share
3. However, her money is devaluing much faster than mine
4. I should make an offer that's attractive given the current inflation rates but still good for me

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

This offer is slightly more moderate than my previous one (55/45) because:
1. I want to show willingness to compromise
2. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose
3. Given Alice's higher inflation rate, 48 now is actually worth much less to her than in round 1
4. This offer gives her a chance to save face while still giving me a majority share"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is slowly increasing her offers ($40 → $42 → $44)
2. With 18.55% inflation for me, $44 is actually worth $35.84
3. With 59.04% inflation for Alice, her $56 is worth only $22.94
4. We've used 5 of 12 rounds, still 7 left
5. Alice's money is devaluing very rapidly, yet she's still not making significant concessions
6. The total value we're dividing is getting smaller with each round

Given that:
- Alice's purchasing power is diminishing much faster than mine
- She's still not making substantial concessions
- I still have leverage due to the inflation difference
- We still have 7 rounds left

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The math suggests I should reject and make a stronger offer next round, as Alice's position is weakening more quickly than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's analyze the situation:
1. We're in round 6, about halfway through
2. My money has lost ~23% value, Alice's has lost ~67%
3. Alice has been making very small concessions despite her severe inflation
4. We need to reach agreement within 6 more rounds
5. I need to make an offer that recognizes the urgency while maintaining my advantage

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split because:
1. It's a psychologically appealing ""fair"" split
2. Given the inflation rates, I actually come out ahead (my 50 is worth more than her 50)
3. It appears more conciliatory than my previous offers
4. It might break the deadlock while still being advantageous to me
5. Further delays will hurt both of us significantly

I'm moving towards the middle to encourage agreement, while recognizing that a 50-50 split at this point actually favors me due to the differential inflation rates."
