"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split while considering potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a reasonable $45 while keeping $55. If you reject, remember that inflation will reduce the value for both of us in the next round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to counteract the inflation penalty we’re both facing with each round, I propose we settle now. Based on a fair alternating-offer framework (with a 10% discount per round), this division gives me $52.63 and you $47.37. Let’s avoid further loss in value—please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 5% inflation for me, $47.37 is now worth about $45 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the value will decrease further
3. Bob's offer is relatively fair, considering the bargaining position and inflation effects
4. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both parties
