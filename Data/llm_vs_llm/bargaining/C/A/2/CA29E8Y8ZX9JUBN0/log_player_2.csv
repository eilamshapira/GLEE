Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52.63, ""alice_gain"": 47.37, ""message"": ""Alice, to counteract the inflation penalty we’re both facing with each round, I propose we settle now. Based on a fair alternating-offer framework (with a 10% discount per round), this division gives me $52.63 and you $47.37. Let’s avoid further loss in value—please accept this offer.""}"
