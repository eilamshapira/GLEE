Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split. This gives you $450000 which is still worth $427500 to you after depreciation. If you reject, the next round will reduce values further for both of us. This is a fair deal that benefits us both.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
