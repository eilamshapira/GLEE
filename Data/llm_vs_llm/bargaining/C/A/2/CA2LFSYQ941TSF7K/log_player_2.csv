"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 because in the next round, the money is worth much less for you due to 20% depreciation. This way, you get a solid amount now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round value for me: $800,000 (20% less)
- Next round value for Alice: $950,000 (5% less)
- I would need to propose a split of this reduced total

3. Considerations:
- Alice is right about the steep depreciation rate for me
- However, her split is quite favorable to her (60-40)
- In the next round, I could propose a better split for myself
- Even with 20% depreciation, I could potentially get more by making my own proposal

4. Decision:
Given that I can propose next round and even with the 20% depreciation I could potentially secure a better deal (e.g., a 70-30 split of $800,000 would give me $560,000), I should reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The total value of $1,000,000 is now worth:
- For me (Bob): $800,000 (20% less)
- For Alice: $950,000 (5% less)

I should propose a split that:
1. Gives me more than the $400,000 offered previously
2. Is still attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering that if she rejects:
   - Next round will be worth even less for both of us
   - She'll lose another 5% on her portion

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 55-45 split. This gives you $450,000 which is still worth $427,500 to you after depreciation. If you reject, the next round will reduce values further for both of us. This is a fair deal that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be as fair as we can while taking inflation into account. I'm offering a nearly equal split. Given the depreciation rates, this is a balanced offer. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer value after depreciation:
- For me: $490,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $313,600
- For Alice: $510,000 × (1 - 0.0975) = $460,275

2. If I reject:
- Next round value will depreciate further:
  - For me: 48.8% less than original (additional 20%)
  - For Alice: 14.26% less than original (additional 5%)
- I would get to make another proposal, but the value would be significantly reduced

3. Considerations:
- This is actually a better offer than the first round in nominal terms ($490K vs $400K)
- However, due to the heavy depreciation, I'm getting less in real terms
- If I reject, the next round's depreciation will be severe
- Alice's split is much more equitable than her first offer
- Further negotiation might result in worse outcomes due to compounding depreciation

4. Decision:
Given the severe depreciation rate I'm facing and the relatively fair split being offered, I should accept this offer. Further rounds would erode my value significantly.
