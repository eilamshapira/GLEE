"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is in Bob's best interest. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. Waiting any longer will likely result in even less favorable offers.
* **Alice's Declining Share:** Alice's proposed share has gone down from 60 to 55.  This indicates she's feeling the pressure of inflation and wants to secure a deal.
* **Potential Future Offers:** There's no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in future rounds. She might propose an even smaller share for Bob.

Taking 45 now is better than risking getting a much smaller amount later."
