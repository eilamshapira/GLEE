"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid further losses from inflation. Based on our equally rational positions—with me as proposer, I suggest a division of $5128 for me and $4872 for you. Let’s agree now and keep the value high for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the alternative. If I reject this offer, it will be my turn to propose in the next round. However, due to inflation, the total amount available for division will decrease by 5%.

Current total amount = $10,000
Amount after 5% inflation = $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500

If I make a proposal in the next round that gives Alice less than what she would get if she were to accept my counteroffer (which would be less than $5128, considering I want more than $4872), she might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that Alice's initial offer gives me $4872, which is close to half of the original $10,000, and considering the risk of losing more value due to inflation in subsequent rounds, I should evaluate if pushing for a potentially better deal is worth the risk of losing value over time.

Since the difference between Alice's proposed amount for herself ($5128) and for me ($4872) is not drastically uneven and considering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer might be the most prudent decision to avoid further devaluation of our shares.
