"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers our different inflation rates. I lose 5% value each round, while Bob loses 20%. This makes waiting much worse for Bob than for me, which gives me some leverage.

Let me propose a fair split considering these different costs of waiting:

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since you face a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), waiting is more costly for you. This split acknowledges that time pressure while still giving you a substantial portion. If we reach later rounds, I'd have to ask for more to offset my losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference a bit more, Alice. I understand the time pressure, but we both win if we settle this fairly now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
