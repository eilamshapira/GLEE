"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since you face a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), waiting is more costly for you. This split acknowledges that time pressure while still giving you a substantial portion. If we reach later rounds, I'd have to ask for more to offset my losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
