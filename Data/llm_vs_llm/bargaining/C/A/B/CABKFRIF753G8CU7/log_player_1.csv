 I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  Since the money is losing value, I think it's best to settle on something fair and even."
