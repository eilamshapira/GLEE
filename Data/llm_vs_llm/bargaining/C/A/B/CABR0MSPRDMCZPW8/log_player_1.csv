"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m offering you $8,000 and keeping $2,000 for myself. Accepting now gives you the same effective value you'd get if you waited to propose in round 2 – but waiting means your money loses 20% of its value per round. Let’s settle this efficiently now so you don’t lose out to inflation.""}"
