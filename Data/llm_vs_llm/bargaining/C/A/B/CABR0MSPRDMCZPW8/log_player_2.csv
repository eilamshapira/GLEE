"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you $8000 and keeping $2000 for myself. Accepting now gives you the same effective value you'd get if you waited to propose in round 2 – but waiting means your money loses 20% of its value per round. Let’s settle this efficiently now so you don’t lose out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Current offer: $8000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * My $8000 would be worth 20% less ($6400 effective value)
   * I could propose a higher amount, but Alice might reject
   * Then we'd lose more rounds to inflation

Alice makes a good point - $8000 now is better than a higher nominal amount later due to the inflation penalty that only affects me. This is actually a very fair offer considering the asymmetric inflation situation.
