833333.0,166667.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $833333 and you get $166667. This split reflects our future bargaining positions—if you reject, you'll propose next but due to your steeper 20% per round discount, your eventual payoff would be similar. I believe this is a fair division that avoids further devaluation. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, considering the devaluation and our respective positions, I believe this split is more reflective of a fair negotiation. It acknowledges your initial proposal but adjusts for the realities of our situation. Let's avoid further devaluation and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,2,

866667.0,133333.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I propose that I receive $866667 while you receive $133333. Allow me to explain: If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 but your effective money will be discounted by an extra 20% (making your money worth only 0.512 of the nominal amount) compared to the 0.64 factor in Round 3. In effect, accepting $133333 now gives you an effective value of about $85333, which is essentially what you’d expect by waiting and then proposing in Round 4 under equilibrium conditions. I believe this split fairly reflects our respective discount rates and avoids further loss from devaluation. I hope you agree and accept.",Alice,3,
