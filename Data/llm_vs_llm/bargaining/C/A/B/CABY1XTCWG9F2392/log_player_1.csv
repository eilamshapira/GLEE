"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 833333, ""bob_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $833,333 and you get $166,667. This split reflects our future bargaining positions—if you reject, you'll propose next but due to your steeper 20% per round discount, your eventual payoff would be similar. I believe this is a fair division that avoids further devaluation. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the devaluation and our respective positions, I believe this split is more reflective of a fair negotiation. It acknowledges your initial proposal but adjusts for the realities of our situation. Let's avoid further devaluation and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 866667, ""bob_gain"": 133333, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I propose that I receive $866,667 while you receive $133,333. Allow me to explain: If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 but your effective money will be discounted by an extra 20% (making your money worth only 0.512 of the nominal amount) compared to the 0.64 factor in Round 3. In effect, accepting $133,333 now gives you an effective value of about $85,333, which is essentially what you’d expect by waiting and then proposing in Round 4 under equilibrium conditions. I believe this split fairly reflects our respective discount rates and avoids further loss from devaluation. I hope you agree and accept.""}"
