"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $833333 and you get $166667. This split reflects our future bargaining positions—if you reject, you'll propose next but due to your steeper 20% per round discount, your eventual payoff would be similar. I believe this is a fair division that avoids further devaluation. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 166667 
# Alice gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept this offer, let's consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and proceeding to the next round, where I (Bob) would make the proposal.

If I reject Alice's offer, the money would be worth 20% less to me in the next round. This means that instead of $1,000,000, I would be dividing $800,000 (since 20% of $1,000,000 is $200,000, leaving $800,000).

For Alice, the money would be worth 5% less, so she would see $950,000 in value for the next round (since 5% of $1,000,000 is $50,000, leaving $950,000).

However, the key point here is to evaluate whether Alice's initial offer is reasonable considering our respective discount rates.

Given Alice's offer of $166,667 to me and $833,333 to her, let's calculate what would happen if I were to propose a split in the next round that favors me more, considering the devaluation.

If I propose a 50/50 split in the next round (which is highly favorable to me, given the initial conditions), I would be offering Alice $400,000 (half of $800,000, the amount left after my 20% devaluation), and I would keep $400,000. However, this doesn't account for Alice's devaluation, which would make her share worth less to her.

Considering Alice's initial offer and the significant disparity in our devaluation rates, her offer might seem more reasonable than risking further devaluation. However, the offer significantly favors Alice, and I need to consider whether I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds.

Given the information and the potential for further negotiation, I decide to reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round, despite the risk of devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is now worth 20% less to me, I'm effectively dividing $800,000. However, to make my offer, I'll consider the original $1,000,000 and then apply my devaluation.

My goal is to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the devaluation that has occurred for me and the potential for further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

Considering the significant difference in our devaluation rates, I want to make an offer that reflects a more balanced split, given the circumstances.

I propose that I receive $450,000, and Alice receives $550,000. This split acknowledges Alice's initial offer but adjusts it to reflect a more equitable division, considering our respective bargaining positions and the impact of inflation.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the devaluation and our respective positions, I believe this split is more reflective of a fair negotiation. It acknowledges your initial proposal but adjusts for the realities of our situation. Let's avoid further devaluation and find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I propose that I receive $866667 while you receive $133333. Allow me to explain: If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 but your effective money will be discounted by an extra 20% (making your money worth only 0.512 of the nominal amount) compared to the 0.64 factor in Round 3. In effect, accepting $133333 now gives you an effective value of about $85333, which is essentially what you’d expect by waiting and then proposing in Round 4 under equilibrium conditions. I believe this split fairly reflects our respective discount rates and avoids further loss from devaluation. I hope you agree and accept. 
# Bob gain: 133333 
# Alice gain: 866667 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the current state of devaluation, where the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less, let's analyze Alice's offer.

Alice's proposal gives me $133,333 and her $866,667. Considering my devaluation, if I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, my share would indeed be worth even less due to the additional 20% devaluation.

To calculate the effective value of accepting $133,333 now versus proposing in Round 4, let's consider the devaluation factors:

1. My current devaluation factor is 0.64 (since 36% devaluation means I retain 64% of the value).
2. If I reject and propose in Round 4, my devaluation factor would be 0.64 * 0.80 = 0.512, as Alice mentioned.

Accepting $133,333 now, with my current devaluation factor of 0.64, gives me an effective value of $133,333 * 0.64 = $85,333.12.

If I wait until Round 4 to propose, with a devaluation factor of 0.512, I would need to calculate what split would give me a similar effective value. However, given the significant disparity in our devaluation rates and the fact that Alice's offer already accounts for this disparity to some extent, it seems that accepting her offer might be the more prudent decision to avoid further loss from devaluation.

Considering these factors and the explanation provided by Alice, it appears that her offer does indeed reflect our respective discount rates and the impact of inflation on our potential gains.
