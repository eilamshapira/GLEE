"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial portion, making it an attractive offer to accept immediately rather than risk inflation effects in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $45, but with 20% inflation = $36 effective value
   * Bob gets $55, with 10% inflation = $49.5 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even worse inflation for me (40%)
   * I'll get to make the offer, but Bob might reject again
   * The declining value makes further negotiation risky

While this offer gives Bob more than me, the inflation penalty makes further negotiation too risky. The effective $36 I would get now is better than risking another round with 40% inflation.
