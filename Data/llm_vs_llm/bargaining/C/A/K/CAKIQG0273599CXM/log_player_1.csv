"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation).

Actual value I'd get: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200

Considering this, I think I can do better. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (1 - 0.2 = 0.8, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'll multiply the amount I want by 0.64 to get the actual value.

I want an actual value of at least 4500, so I'll offer myself:

4500 / 0.64 = 7031.25

Rounded down to make it a reasonable offer, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, consider it""
}
```"
