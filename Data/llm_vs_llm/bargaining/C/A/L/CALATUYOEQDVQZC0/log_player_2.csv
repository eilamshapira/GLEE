"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer and make a decision.

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000.

Since this is only the first round and I have no inflation penalty (the money is worth 0% less for me in each round), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. The split Alice proposed favors her significantly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer, now proposing that I receive $450,000 while she gets $550,000. I also see that Alice is experiencing inflation (9.75% less value than in round 1), while I'm still not affected by inflation.

Given that Alice has moved closer to an equal split and is facing inflation pressure that I'm not, this offer is better than her initial one. However, I still have room to negotiate for a more favorable split since I don't face any inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice improved her offer but is facing inflation that doesn't affect me, I'll make a more balanced counter-offer that acknowledges her previous movement toward the middle.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I propose that I receive $480,000 and Alice receives $520,000. This is a more equitable split that moves us closer to agreement while recognizing that Alice faces inflation pressure that I don't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Alice has improved her offer again, now proposing I receive $470,000 while she gets $530,000. She's continuing to move toward a more balanced split, and her inflation penalty has increased to 18.55% compared to round 1.

Her offer is getting closer to the one I just made ($480,000 for me, $520,000 for her). Given that she's facing significant inflation while I'm not, and we're only $10,000 apart from my last proposal, I'll accept this offer.
