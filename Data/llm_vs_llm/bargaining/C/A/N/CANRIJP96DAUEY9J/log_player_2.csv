"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $30, keeping $70 for herself. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $80)
- For Alice, it will only depreciate by 5% (so $100 becomes worth $95)

Given this asymmetric inflation pressure, I'm at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations. However, $30 is still quite low considering we're starting with equal bargaining positions.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. I need to consider that:
1. For the next round, the money will be worth 80% to me and 95% to Alice
2. I should make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept to avoid further devaluation
3. The first offer of 70-30 was too skewed in Alice's favor

I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice made an aggressive first offer.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split as it's more equitable than the initial offer, while still giving Alice a substantial portion. If she rejects, the next round will reduce the real value for both of us, creating pressure to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $30 to $35
2. Due to inflation:
   - For me, $35 is now worth only $22.40 (64% of $35)
   - For Alice, $65 is worth $58.66 (90.25% of $65)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have even worse inflation
   - I can make another counter-offer, but the money will be worth even less

Alice's slight improvement in the offer doesn't compensate for the inflation loss. However, given the asymmetric inflation pressure (I lose value much faster than Alice), prolonging the negotiation will put me at an even greater disadvantage.

Since my bargaining position is weakening faster than Alice's, and further rounds will only decrease the real value of any outcome for me more dramatically, I'll accept this offer.
