"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Original value: $45
Inflation reduction (20%): $45 * 0.8 = $36

Since Bob's offer gives me $36 (in terms of actual value), which is less than half of the original $100, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer.

In Round 3, the original $100 is worth:
For me: $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64 (due to 20% inflation reduction in two rounds)
For Bob: $100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $90.25 (due to 5% inflation reduction in two rounds)

My offer:
{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation reduces our gains further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation effects on both sides. Better to end it now than risk losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Original value: $50
Inflation reduction (20% in Round 1, 20% in Round 2, and 20% in Round 3, and 20% in Round 4): $50 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $50 * 0.4096 = $20.48

Although the nominal value is $50, the actual value I'd get is $20.48. Since this is a significant reduction, I'll consider Bob's message and the fact that the inflation reduction is more severe for me.
