"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, considering the devaluation you face. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $500,000, but due to the 10% devaluation, it's effectively worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the devaluation, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

For me, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so in Round 3, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so in Round 3, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more, considering Bob's steeper devaluation:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, I think this split is more reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the devaluation I'm facing. Let's settle here. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $550,000, but due to the 27.1% devaluation, it's effectively worth $550,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $550,000 * 0.729 = $401,950 to me.

Considering this, I think this offer might be reasonable, given the significant devaluation Bob is facing. If I reject this offer, the devaluation will continue to erode the value of the money, and I might end up with an even worse deal.
