"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the game scenario. Since I'm playing as Alice and making the first proposal, I need to factor in the asymmetric inflation effects - the money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but Bob loses 5% value per round.

This gives me bargaining power, as Bob has incentive to accept sooner rather than later. A fair split accounting for this advantage would be reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $450,000 which is a fair offer considering your 5% inflation penalty. If we go to the next round, your share would be worth less to you, while mine maintains value. Let's settle now for mutual benefit.""}"
