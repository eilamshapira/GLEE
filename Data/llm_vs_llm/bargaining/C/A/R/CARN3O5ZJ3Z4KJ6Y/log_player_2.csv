"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $450000 which is a fair offer considering your 5% inflation penalty. If we go to the next round, your share would be worth less to you, while mine maintains value. Let's settle now for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $450,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value would be worth 5% less to me. So even if I proposed a more favorable split and Alice accepted, I'd need to get significantly more than $450,000 to offset the inflation.

Since Alice has no inflation penalty, she has less pressure to accept my counter-offer. And if she rejects, we'd go to round 3 where I'd face another 5% inflation, putting me in an even worse position.

Given this dynamic, $450,000 is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I face.
