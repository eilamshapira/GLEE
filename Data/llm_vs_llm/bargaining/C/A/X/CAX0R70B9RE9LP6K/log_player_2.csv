Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try again. Inflation is hurting us both. How about I take 5300 and you take 4700? It's still a good deal given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, my effective gain would be approximately 4700 * 0.81 = 3807. 

Considering this, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less in round 3, and it will be worth approximately 10% more less in round 4, so it's 29% less than in the first round. 

My effective share should take this into account.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're wasting time and money. Let's split it 50/50. It's fair, and better than getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 34.39% less, my effective gain would be approximately 5000 * 0.6561 = 3280.5.

Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split might not be a bad idea, especially since the value will continue to decrease.
