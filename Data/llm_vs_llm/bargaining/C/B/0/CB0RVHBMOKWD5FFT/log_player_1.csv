"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I face a 10% inflation penalty in future rounds, while Bob doesn't lose value over time. This division gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my new offer for Round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm slightly reducing my requested amount to find a more acceptable middle ground. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while Bob doesn't, it's important we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob nearly half while still accounting for my disadvantage in delaying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
