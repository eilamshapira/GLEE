9000.0,1000.0,Let's get this done quickly! I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor to avoid the risk of inflation. What do you say?,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"I think a 50/50 split is much more fair. This gives us both $5000, which is substantial. I understand we both face inflation, with mine at 20% and yours at 10%, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly - but I need a reasonable share. This even split respects both our interests.",Bob,2,
