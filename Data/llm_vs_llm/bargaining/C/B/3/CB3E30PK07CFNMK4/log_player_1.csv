"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is much more fair. This gives us both $5000, which is substantial. I understand we both face inflation, with mine at 20% and yours at 10%, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly - but I need a reasonable share. This even split respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
