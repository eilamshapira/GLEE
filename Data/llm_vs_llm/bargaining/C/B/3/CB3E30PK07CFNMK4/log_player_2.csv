"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor to avoid the risk of inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me only 10% of the total sum, which seems quite unfair. Since inflation affects me more heavily (20% per round vs 10% for Alice), there's some pressure to agree quickly, but not at such an unfavorable split.

If I reject now and make a counteroffer in round 2, I'll be able to propose something more balanced, and we'll still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation differences.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is much more fair. This gives us both $5000, which is substantial. I understand we both face inflation, with mine at 20% and yours at 10%, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly - but I need a reasonable share. This even split respects both our interests.""}"
