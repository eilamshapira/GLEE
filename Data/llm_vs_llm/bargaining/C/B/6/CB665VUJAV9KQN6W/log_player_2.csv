"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, giving each of us $500,000. This is a fair proposal on the surface.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $950,000. I could then propose a split that gives me more than $500,000, but Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and each round decreases the value by 5%, accepting a fair split now prevents us from losing money to inflation.
