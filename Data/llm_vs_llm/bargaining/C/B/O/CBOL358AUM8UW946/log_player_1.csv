"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45 this time. It's a fair counteroffer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value I'd get. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll get 90% of the proposed $450,000.

Actual value for me = $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, considering inflation, 55/45 seems fair to me now""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, a 60/40 split seems reasonable now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value I'd get. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I'll get 72.9% of the proposed $400,000.

Actual value for me = $400,000 * 0.729 = $291,600

Given this, I think I should accept this offer, as the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.
