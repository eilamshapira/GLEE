600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair yet efficient division: I'll receive $600000 and you'll receive $400000. Given the inflation risk as rounds progress, I believe it's in our mutual best interest to finalize an agreement now. I'm looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is in order. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share to settle this quickly. Let's divide the amount as proposed.",Bob,2,

460000.0,540000.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate our ongoing dialogue. I understand you're concerned about the inflation impacting your share. To help us both avoid further loss in value, I'm putting forward a revised division: I'll take $460000 and you'll receive $540000. Given that any delay means your dollars continue to lose 20% of their value compared to round 1, this offer gives you nearly what you would expect if you waitedâ€”with the added benefit of avoiding more inflation. I hope you agree this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",Alice,3,
