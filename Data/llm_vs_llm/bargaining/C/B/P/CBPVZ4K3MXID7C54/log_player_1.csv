  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair yet efficient division: I'll receive $600,000 and you'll receive $400,000. Given the inflation risk as rounds progress, I believe it's in our mutual best interest to finalize an agreement now. I'm looking forward to your response.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is in order. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share to settle this quickly. Let's divide the amount as proposed. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 460000,
  ""bob_gain"": 540000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate our ongoing dialogue. I understand you're concerned about the inflation impacting your share. To help us both avoid further loss in value, I'm putting forward a revised division: I'll take $460,000 and you'll receive $540,000. Given that any delay means your dollars continue to lose 20% of their value compared to round 1, this offer gives you nearly what you would expect if you waitedâ€”with the added benefit of avoiding more inflation. I hope you agree this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.""
