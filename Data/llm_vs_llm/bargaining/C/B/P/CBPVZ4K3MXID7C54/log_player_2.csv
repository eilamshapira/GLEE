Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair yet efficient division: I'll receive $600000 and you'll receive $400000. Given the inflation risk as rounds progress, I believe it's in our mutual best interest to finalize an agreement now. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is in order. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a larger share to settle this quickly. Let's divide the amount as proposed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate our ongoing dialogue. I understand you're concerned about the inflation impacting your share. To help us both avoid further loss in value, I'm putting forward a revised division: I'll take $460000 and you'll receive $540000. Given that any delay means your dollars continue to lose 20% of their value compared to round 1, this offer gives you nearly what you would expect if you waitedâ€”with the added benefit of avoiding more inflation. I hope you agree this is a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000
