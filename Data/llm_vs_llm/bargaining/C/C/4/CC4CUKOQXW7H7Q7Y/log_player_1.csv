Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that waiting another round will cost you 10% due to inflation, this offer gives you $30 now which is better than a larger amount later. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
