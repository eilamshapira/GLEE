"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation that I will be facing in the future. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60 for herself. She's correct that she faces 10% inflation per round while I face 0% inflation.

If I reject:
- I can make a counter-offer next round
- For Alice, the $100 total will be worth 10% less
- So in the next round, $100 to Alice is equivalent to $90 now
- This gives me negotiating leverage

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round, where Alice will be more likely to accept due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, while I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself. The total $100 is now worth only $90 to Alice, so she should be more willing to accept a lower amount.

I'll propose a 70/30 split in my favor, but frame it diplomatically.

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, considering that waiting another round will cost you 10% due to inflation, this offer gives you $30 now which is better than a larger amount later. Let's conclude this now so you don't lose more value.""}"
