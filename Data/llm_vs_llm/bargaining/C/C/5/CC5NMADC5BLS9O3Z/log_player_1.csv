"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but I think it's still a reasonable split that Bob should accept, considering the potential for losses due to inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
