"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider that any delays will cost me 20% per round due to inflation, while Bob doesn't lose value. I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm making the first move but need to account for potential inflation losses if we go to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $3200
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less (40% total reduction)
- My original offer was rejected, showing Bob is driving a hard bargain

Given that further delays will significantly reduce my effective gains due to compounding inflation, and Bob's position is stronger since he doesn't face inflation, I should accept this offer. $3200 effective value is better than risking further devaluation.
