"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I think this is a fair offer to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
3. $40 now is better than $45 after inflation in the next round
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

While the split isn't completely equal, the difference isn't large enough to risk losing value through inflation and potential future negotiations. I'll accept this offer.
