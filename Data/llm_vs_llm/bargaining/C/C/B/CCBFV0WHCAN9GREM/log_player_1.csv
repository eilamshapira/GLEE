"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the effects of inflation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The original $100 is now worth 90% of its value to me.
*   **My original offer:** 60 for me, 40 for Bob.
*   **Bob's offer:** 40 for me, 60 for Bob.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account the inflation from the previous rounds.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The original $100 is now worth 90% * 90% = 81% of its value to me.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The original $100 is now worth 80% * 80% = 64% of its value to Bob.

Considering these factors, I will make the following offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
