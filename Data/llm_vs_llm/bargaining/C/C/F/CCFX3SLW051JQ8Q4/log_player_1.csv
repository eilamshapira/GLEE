Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that I'm affected by higher depreciation (20% vs your 5%), this split better reflects our different time preferences while still giving you a substantial amount. It's better for both of us to agree now rather than lose value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
