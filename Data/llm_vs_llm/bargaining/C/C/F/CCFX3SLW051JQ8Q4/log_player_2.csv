"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and taking $600,000
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Only 5% less to Alice
   * But I'll get to make the offer

3. Current value for me: $400,000
   Next round maximum potential: $800,000 × 0.8 = $640,000

4. Since I can potentially get more in the next round even with the 20% depreciation, and Alice's depreciation is much lower (5%), I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. I need to consider that:
   * For me, this round's money is worth 80% of original value
   * For Alice, it's worth 95% of original value
   * If Alice rejects, next round will depreciate further
   * Alice needs to find this offer more attractive than making a counter-offer

2. A fair split considering depreciation rates would give me a larger share to compensate for my higher depreciation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that I'm affected by higher depreciation (20% vs your 5%), this split better reflects our different time preferences while still giving you a substantial amount. It's better for both of us to agree now rather than lose value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder. However, I think this is a reasonable compromise given our starting point. Let's finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer value for me:
   * $450,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $288,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make an offer next round:
   * My money will be worth 48.8% less (0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8)
   * Even if I propose getting the full million, it would be worth:
   * $1,000,000 × (1 - 0.488) = $512,000

3. Alice has offered a better split than her first offer
   * Moving from 400k to 450k shows willingness to compromise
   * The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains in future rounds
   * Further negotiation might lead to both of us losing more value

4. Given the accelerating depreciation rate for me and the improved offer, it's better to accept now.
