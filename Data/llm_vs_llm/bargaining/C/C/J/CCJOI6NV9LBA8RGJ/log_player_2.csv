"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There are still 11 rounds left if I reject
4. The money doesn't lose value for me over time

While $40 isn't terrible, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since there's no downside for me to continue negotiating (no inflation penalty), I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm the one making the offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal, and it's reasonable enough that it might be accepted. I'm offering Alice a fair portion while trying to secure a bit more for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45
2. I now know that Alice is affected by inflation (36% less value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation
4. Her $55 is actually worth less to her now due to inflation
5. There are still 9 rounds left

Since Alice is affected by inflation and I'm not, I have a stronger negotiating position. The fact that she increased her offer shows she's feeling pressure from inflation. I can probably get a better deal by waiting, as her share will continue to lose value for her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that I know Alice is affected by inflation and feeling its pressure (as shown by her increased offer), I'll make a stronger proposal in my favor. Since her money loses value over time, she has more incentive to accept a deal sooner rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my request significantly because:
1. Alice is affected by inflation while I'm not
2. She's shown willingness to negotiate by increasing her previous offer
3. Her share will continue to lose value for her with each round
4. We still have 8 rounds left, but the inflation pressure on her side should encourage her to accept a less favorable deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me again (from $45 to $55)
2. The inflation impact on Alice has increased significantly (now 59.04%)
3. Her $45 is worth much less to her than it was initially
4. I'm still not affected by inflation
5. There are 7 rounds remaining

Alice's behavior confirms my strategy - she's steadily offering me more as inflation erodes her purchasing power. Since I have no inflation pressure and her money continues to lose value, I believe I can get an even better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has shown a clear pattern of increasing her offers as inflation affects her more severely (from 40 to 45 to 55 for my share), and her money is now worth less than half of its original value, I'll propose an even stronger split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

My reasoning:
1. Alice is severely affected by inflation (59.04% and growing)
2. She's demonstrated willingness to offer me more in each round
3. Her share continues to lose value rapidly for her
4. I'm not affected by inflation at all
5. We still have 6 rounds left, but the inflation pressure on her side is becoming very significant
6. The longer she waits, the less value she'll get from any share"
