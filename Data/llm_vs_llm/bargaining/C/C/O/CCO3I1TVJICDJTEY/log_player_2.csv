"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
* If I reject, we go to next round where:
  * My money will be worth 10% less
  * Her money will be worth 5% less
  * I'll get to make the counter-offer

$400,000 now is better than $440,000 next round (which would be worth $396,000 after 10% inflation).

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable first offer and the cost of delay makes accepting attractive.
