"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * I'll have negotiating power

$400,000 is a significant amount, but it's less than half. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs 5%), there's more urgency for me to make a deal sooner rather than later. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making the next offer, even accounting for the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept considering her lower inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a majority share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. Given that she faces only 5% inflation per round compared to my 20%, she might accept this rather than risk further negotiations where both of us lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer of $420,000 for me, after 36% inflation means I'd effectively get:
   * $420,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $268,800 in round 1 value

2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My inflation will increase to 48.8% (another 20% loss)
   * Alice's inflation will increase to 14.3% (another 5% loss)
   * Any future gains will be significantly diminished for me

3. Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1 ($400,000 → $420,000)

Given the severe inflation penalty I'm facing and that Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by increasing my share, I should accept this offer. Waiting longer will significantly reduce my effective gains due to my high inflation rate.
