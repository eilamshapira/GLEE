"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs 10% per round), I should aim for a favorable deal early. However, I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a substantial amount for Bob, while giving me a good share. If Bob refuses, the next round will already reduce my purchasing power by 20%, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000, but at 80% value = $320,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 90% value = $540,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But my money will be worth another 20% less (64% of original)
   * Bob's will be worth another 10% less (81% of original)
   * I would need to secure a significantly larger portion to make up for the inflation loss

Given that the inflation rate is working against me more than Bob (20% vs 10%), waiting longer significantly reduces my bargaining power. While this isn't my ideal split, getting $320,000 in effective value now is better than risking further depreciation.
