"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, with inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, accepting $5000 now is better than potentially getting more in later rounds.

If I reject and propose something higher next round, Alice might reject, and we'd continue losing value. Even if I got $6000 in round 2, it would only be worth $5400 due to inflation.

A fair split in round 1 with no value loss is the most efficient outcome.
