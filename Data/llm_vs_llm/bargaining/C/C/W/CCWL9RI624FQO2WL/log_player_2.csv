"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the value we each bring. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value of the deal is decreasing with each round, Bob.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4500 I would gain is actually worth $4500 * 0.64 = $2880 in the original value.
Given this, I think it's time to settle.
