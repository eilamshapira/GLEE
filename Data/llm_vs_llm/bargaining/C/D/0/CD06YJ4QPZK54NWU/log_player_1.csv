"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable adjustment, giving us both a significant portion. Let's secure this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept this offer now:
My actual value = $4500 * 0.8 = $3600

If I reject and we continue:
- Next round I'll face 40% total inflation
- But I can make a new proposal

Given that we have 10 rounds left and the inflation only affects me, it's better to secure a decent amount now rather than risk further devaluation.

$3600 is still a significant amount, and Bob's split is not extremely unfair.
