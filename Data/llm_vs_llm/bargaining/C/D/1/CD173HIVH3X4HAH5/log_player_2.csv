"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. Since this is the first round, if I reject, I can make a counteroffer next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and propose a better split for myself, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and my potential gains will continue to decrease by 20% each round.

Given this uncertainty and the significant inflation penalty, I think it's best to accept this initial offer.
