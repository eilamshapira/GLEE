"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation hits you harder! I need 60 to compensate for that. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $40 I'd get is actually worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 to me.

Given this, I don't think Bob's offer is fair. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer.

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value, so $1 is worth $0.6 to me. For Bob, the money is worth 10% * 2 = 20% less, so $1 is worth $0.8 to him.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much!""}"
