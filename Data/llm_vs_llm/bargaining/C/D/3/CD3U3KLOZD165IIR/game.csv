,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm taking a slightly larger share this round. Inflation's a killer, and I need to secure my future a little better. Take it or leave it, but the longer we wait, the less we both get.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
620000.0,380000.0,My turn! Inflation is hitting us hard. My offer is significantly better to offset the last round's low offer and the ongoing loss of value. Let's be reasonable and secure a good outcome for both of us before it's too late.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Okay, Alice, let's try this one more time. I'm adjusting my offer, taking the inflation into account, to get a fair split for both of us. We can't afford to keep letting the money depreciate. This is my final offer. Accept it or risk getting nothing.",Bob,4,
