"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob, considering that inflation decreases the money's value by 10% each round for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we move to the next round, inflation will reduce the total value for me by 10%, which would mean we're both losing potential value. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both substantial amounts without risking value depreciation.""
