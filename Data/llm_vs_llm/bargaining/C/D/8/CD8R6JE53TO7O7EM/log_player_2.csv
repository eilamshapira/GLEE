"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Initial value: $1,000,000
With 20% inflation per round, if I reject now:
- Next round the money will be worth 20% less to me
- $500,000 now would become worth $400,000 to me in the next round

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is seemingly fair. However, given that inflation will reduce my purchasing power in future rounds, getting a fair deal now is better than risking a worse deal later.
