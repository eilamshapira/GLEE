"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I believe we can split the money more evenly. I propose you receive $4000 and I receive $6000. This way we both get a fair share. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
