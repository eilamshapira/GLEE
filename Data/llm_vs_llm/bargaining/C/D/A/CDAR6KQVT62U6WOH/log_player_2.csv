"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal: I'll receive $6000 and you get $4000. Settling now is beneficial since each round delays reduces my share by 20%. I believe this is a fair and efficient division. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
