"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my initial offer for dividing $10,000. Given that inflation will reduce the value of money more significantly for me than for Bob in future rounds, I should aim for a fair but advantageous first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

The total value of the money is currently at its highest. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion while keeping the larger share for myself, which seems reasonable as the initiator of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer in round 3.

If I accept this offer:
- I get $5,500, but it's worth 20% less than in round 1, so its effective value to me is $5,500 Ã— 0.8 = $4,400

If I reject and we go to round 3:
- The money would be worth 40% less to me than in round 1
- Any amount would be multiplied by 0.6 for my effective value
- To get an effective value higher than $4,400, I'd need to secure more than $7,333 in round 3

Given that Bob has already shown he's willing to reject a 60/40 split, it seems unlikely I could secure a much better deal in the next round when inflation would hurt me more significantly.
