"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose taking $600000 for myself and giving you $400000. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on our gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. 
The total amount of money that I can divide is still $1,000,000, but its value has decreased.
To calculate my offer, I will consider the decreased value of the money.
For me, the money is worth 90% of its original value, and for Alice, it's worth 95% of its original value.
I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer. I propose taking $550000 for myself and giving you $450000. This should be more acceptable considering the current circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth even less to both of us. 
For me, the money is worth 81% of its original value (10% decrease in round 1, 10% decrease in round 2, and another 10% decrease in round 3, which is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, but considering the correct calculation of the decrease: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 for two rounds, and for the third round 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729), and for Alice, it's worth 85.7375% of its original value (5% decrease in round 1, 5% decrease in round 2, and another 5% decrease in round 3, which is 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375).
However, the correct calculation of the value for me after 3 rounds should be: 
1st round: 100% * 0.9 = 90%
2nd round: 90% * 0.9 = 81%
3rd round: 81% * 0.9 = 72.9%
And for Alice:
1st round: 100% * 0.95 = 95%
2nd round: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%
3rd round: 90.25% * 0.95 = 85.7375%
I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.
