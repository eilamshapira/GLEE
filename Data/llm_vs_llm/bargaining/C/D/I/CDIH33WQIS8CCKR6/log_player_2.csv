"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll be making the next offer, but inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20%. So if we divide the same $100 in the next round, my $40 would effectively be worth only $32 due to inflation.

Given this inflation penalty, it's better for me to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds, even though I'll get to make the next proposal if I reject.
