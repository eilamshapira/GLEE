"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs my 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable first-round offer rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a substantial amount for both parties
2. If Bob rejects, his next-round money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 5% less
3. It's fair enough to have a good chance of acceptance, avoiding value loss for both of us"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $4500 is worth $4275 (95% of original value)
   * Bob's $5500 is worth $4400 (80% of original value)

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Values will decrease further (my 5%, Bob's 20%)
   * I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
   * We'd both lose more value to inflation

3. While this offer gives Bob a larger nominal amount, after accounting for inflation, the real values are relatively close ($4275 vs $4400)

Given that further delays will erode value for both of us, and the current offer is reasonably fair after accounting for inflation...
