"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me $4000, I should consider the impact of inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 for me. Given that, I should try to get more than $4000 in the current round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a compelling offer considering the inflation rates. Since I've rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a division that gives me a better outcome while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than moving to another round where she'd face 5% inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and Alice gets $4,500. This is better for me than the $4,000 I was offered, and Alice should consider that if she rejects, the total pot will be worth 5% less to her in the next round. So accepting $4,500 now is better than potentially getting less value in a future round."
