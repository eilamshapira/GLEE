"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer to split the money equally at $500,000 each.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less per round), the money's value doesn't decrease over time. This means I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

However, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and I don't know how inflation affects Alice - she might have an incentive to settle quickly. Rejecting fair offers might lead to worse outcomes if we end up in extended negotiations.
