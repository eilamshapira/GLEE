"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly to get started. I get the larger share because I propose first. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $600,000 and I get $400,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to remember that if I reject and we move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we could lose more value in subsequent rounds.

Let me calculate: If I reject, the $1,000,000 will be worth 5% less to me, so the total value to me would be $950,000. Any counter-offer I make would have to consider this reduced value. Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable (though not equal) initial offer, I'll accept.
