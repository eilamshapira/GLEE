Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think it's fair that I get a bit more this time. We need to wrap this up soon, as the value is dropping fast. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though it's less than what I offered in the previous round, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant. It's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal now than risk losing even more to inflation in the next round."
