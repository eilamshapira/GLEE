0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, in this first round I’m aware that any delay only hurts me while leaving your dollars fully intact. To avoid all unnecessary rounds—which would only diminish my own share—I propose to give you the entire $10000 right now. I know that if you hold out, you could secure essentially the full pie on your turn, so I’m offering you what you deserve immediately. I hope you’ll accept this fair and efficient resolution.",Alice,1,
