"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this first round I’m aware that any delay only hurts me while leaving your dollars fully intact. To avoid all unnecessary rounds—which would only diminish my own share—I propose to give you the entire $10000 right now. I know that if you hold out, you could secure essentially the full pie on your turn, so I’m offering you what you deserve immediately. I hope you’ll accept this fair and efficient resolution. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is correct that inflation affects only her share (10% per round) while my share maintains its value
2. She's offering me the entire $10,000
3. This is literally the maximum amount I could possibly get
4. Even if I reject and make a counter-offer, I couldn't get more than $10,000
5. There's no strategic advantage in rejecting this offer

Since this offer gives me the maximum possible amount and there's no way to improve my position by rejecting, I should accept.
