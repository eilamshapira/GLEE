"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for me, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a slight advantage for me. If Bob rejects this, any future gains will be worth less due to 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offered $5000 for me is actually worth only $4750 (5% less) due to inflation
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount will be worth even less (another 5% reduction)
3. Bob's offered 50-50 split is actually disadvantageous for me due to inflation
4. However, if I reject, the next round will be even worse for me

Given that inflation will continue to reduce my value in future rounds, and Bob seems to be resistant to giving me more than half, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
