"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the 5% inflation that affects my gains with each round. To maximize my potential gain, I should aim for a deal that Bob is likely to accept in this first round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain of $520,000 now is worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1.

Value of $520,000 now = $520,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $494,000 (in round 1 dollars).

I need to decide if $494,000 is better than potentially gaining less in a future round due to further inflation, and factoring in the risk that Bob might reject future offers altogether. Given the potential for further loss, this is probably the best I can get from Bob.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
