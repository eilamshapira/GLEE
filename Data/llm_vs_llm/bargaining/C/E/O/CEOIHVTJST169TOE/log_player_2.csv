"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. $400,000 is a substantial amount, but not quite fair split

Given that:
- Inflation will reduce the value of any future gains
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer
- $400,000 is still a significant amount

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can propose a more equitable split next round, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but considering that:
1. The money is now worth 5% less to me
2. I need to make an attractive enough offer for Alice to accept
3. A fair split would promote acceptance

I'll propose a slight advantage to Alice to encourage acceptance while maintaining better terms for myself than her initial offer:

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

This offer gives Alice a slight advantage ($520k vs $480k) which should make it appealing, while significantly improving my position compared to her initial offer. The split is more equitable than the 40-60 split she proposed, and given the 5% inflation impact on my side, it's important to get an agreement now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation."
