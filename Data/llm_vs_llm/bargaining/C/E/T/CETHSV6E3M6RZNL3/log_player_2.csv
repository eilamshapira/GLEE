"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of an even split, where I would get $5,000 and she would get $5,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning any amount will be worth 5% less to me. If I propose a better deal for myself in round 2, Alice might reject it, leading to even more inflation in subsequent rounds.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that an even split is objectively fair, I'll accept this offer.
