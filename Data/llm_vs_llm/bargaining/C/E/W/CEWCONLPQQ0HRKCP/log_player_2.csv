"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, I need to consider whether to accept now or reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I could potentially get more in the next round, but the 5% inflation means the total value would be reduced to $95 for me. So even if I managed to get a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd only receive $47.50, which is still better than the current $40.

However, there's risk in rejecting - Alice might make an even less favorable offer in future rounds, and we'd lose more value to inflation with each rejection.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll aim for a fair division while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $100, which I believe is fair to both of us. This way, we both receive an equal share and can avoid further rounds where inflation would reduce the value of my portion. A balanced agreement now benefits us both by maximizing the total value we can share."
