"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable compromise, and we can both avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
I get $450,000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $360,000 to me.

If I reject:
- Next round I could offer again, but the money will be worth another 20% less to me
- Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again
- After more rounds, even a larger share could be worth less than what I'm being offered now

$360,000 is still a significant amount, and continuing the negotiation is risky due to the increasing inflation penalty. Bob's offer is reasonable enough given my current position.
