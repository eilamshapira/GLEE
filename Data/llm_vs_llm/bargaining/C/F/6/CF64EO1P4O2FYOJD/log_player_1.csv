"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us each round. In the first round, the inflation hasn't kicked in yet.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I am offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount. This gives him a strong incentive to accept the offer immediately. While I am keeping a larger share, the initial value of the money is highest in this round, making it beneficial for me to secure a larger portion upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My perspective:** $500,000 in this round is worth 80% of $500,000 in round 1, so it's worth $400,000 to me.
*   **Bob's perspective:** $500,000 in this round is worth 95% of $500,000 in round 1, so it's worth $475,000 to him.

Given the inflation, this is an offer that is almost equal to the value in the first round for me.
