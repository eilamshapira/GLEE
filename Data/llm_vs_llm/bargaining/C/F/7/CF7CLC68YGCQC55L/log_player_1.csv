"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly with me getting a bit more since my money loses value each round. This way we both benefit without dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split this 55/45 in your favor, acknowledging the inflation disadvantage you face.  Let's wrap this up quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $36 to me (45 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth even less (60% of original value)
3. Bob's offer is not very generous considering I'm facing inflation and he isn't
4. However, continuing to next round will likely make things worse for me
