480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, to prevent further loss from inflation on my side and to ensure we both get as much value as possible, I propose an immediate deal: you receive $520000 and I receive $480000. Waiting might benefit you if your funds aren’t similarly affected, but it will cost me 5% per round—so let’s settle now before the pie shrinks further. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,1,
