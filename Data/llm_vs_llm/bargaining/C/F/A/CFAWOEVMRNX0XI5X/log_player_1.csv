"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation effect on Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob with each passing round, I should offer a reasonable split that incentivizes him to accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500, Bob. This is a fair offer considering that if you reject and we go to the next round, the total value will be worth less to you due to the 10% inflation on your side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob rejected my initial 5500/4500 split and offered the reverse, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob faces 10% inflation each round, I'll make an offer that accounts for this pressure on him.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200}

Bob, I'm offering you $4,200. Consider that if we go to another round, the value will decrease by another 10% for you. This offer gives you more value now than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
