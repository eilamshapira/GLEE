"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be fair but also consider the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% of the total amount and Bob 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value I'd receive. The offer of $480,000 is now worth 80% of its original value to me, which is $480,000 * 0.8 = $384,000.

On the other hand, Bob's offer gives him $520,000, which is worth 90% of its original value to him, or $520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less to me now (20% less with each round), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself while still being reasonable.

In the previous round, the money was worth 80% of its original value to me. Now, it's worth 80% * 0.8 = 64% of its original value.

I'll aim to get a bit more than Bob offered me in the previous round, considering the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This gives me 52% of the total amount and Bob 48%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
