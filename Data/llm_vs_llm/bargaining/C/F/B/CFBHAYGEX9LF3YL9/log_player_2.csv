"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice due to inflation. So next round, the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice.

Given the different inflation rates, I might be able to negotiate a better deal. However, Alice's initial offer is fairly reasonable - not too far from a 50/50 split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being reasonable enough that Alice would likely accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself while still giving Alice a substantial portion. Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% vs. my 10%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner, which is why I'm proposing a split slightly in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $480,000, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $450,000.

Current inflation impacts:
- For me: Money is worth 19% less (so $480,000 is worth about $388,800 in original value)
- For Alice: Money is worth 36% less (so $520,000 is worth about $332,800 in original value)

If I reject again:
- My inflation goes to 27.1% (another 10% decrease)
- Alice's inflation goes to 48.8% (another 20% decrease)

Alice has improved her offer, and with inflation accelerating differently for both of us, the total pie is shrinking faster for her. While I could try for a better deal, there's risk in continuing negotiations.
