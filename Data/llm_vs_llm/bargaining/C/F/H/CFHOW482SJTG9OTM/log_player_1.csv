"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 20% for me. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable as a starting point.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion while accounting for the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
- If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now, I'll get $5000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $4000 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me
- $4000 in real value is less than what I offered initially, but it's still a significant amount

Given the inflation risk and that Bob might make an even less favorable offer in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
