"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the amount with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get 4500$ while she gets 5500$. This isn't quite a 50-50 split, and she's suggesting she also faces inflation risks.

However, I know for certain that if I reject this offer, my money will be worth 10% less in the next round due to inflation. If I make a counter-offer for 5000$ in the next round and Alice accepts, I'd actually only get 5000$ Ã— 0.9 = 4500$ in effective value due to the 10% inflation.

Given this inflation penalty, Alice's current offer of 4500$ is equivalent to what I'd effectively get if I proposed and received a 50-50 split in the next round. Any delay risks further devaluation of my share.
