"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential earnings with each round. Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Rationale:**

*   I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself (60/40 split) as the first proposer.
*   I need to balance the desire for a good initial share with the risk of rejection, considering the inflation penalty in later rounds. Giving Bob $40 seems like a reasonable amount that he might accept rather than risk getting less in subsequent rounds."
