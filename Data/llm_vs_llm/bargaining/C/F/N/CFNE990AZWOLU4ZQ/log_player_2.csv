"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my thought process as Bob:

*   **Initial Situation:** We need to split $100. Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60.

*   **Inflation:** Every round the money is worth 5% less to me. If I reject this offer and we go to round 2, my $40 would be worth $38.

*   **Risk/Reward:** If I reject, I risk Alice offering me less next round. I also risk further inflation eating away at my potential earnings. However, if Alice is being unreasonable, I might get a better deal next round (if Alice is also suffering from inflation and fear).

*   **Decision:** $40 isn't great, but it's not terrible. Considering the inflation and the uncertainty of Alice's next offer, I'll accept this offer.
