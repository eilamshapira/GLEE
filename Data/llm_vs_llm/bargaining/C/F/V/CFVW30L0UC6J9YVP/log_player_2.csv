"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. Given that there's a 10% inflation penalty for each round I reject, I should evaluate if making a counter-offer would be beneficial.

If I reject and move to round 2, the total value to me would be $900,000 (10% less). This means even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I'd be working with less total value from my perspective.

This offer gives me a guaranteed $100,000. If I reject, I might be able to get more in the next round, but I'd also risk Alice rejecting my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given the significant asymmetry in this initial offer (10% vs 90%), I believe it's reasonable to try for a better distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose we split the money more equitably, with you receiving $550,000 and me receiving $450,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us a substantial portion of the total, while accounting for the fact that the value decreases for me in later rounds due to inflation."
