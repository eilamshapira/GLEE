"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the first offer and need to account for inflation affecting both parties (but me more severely at 20% vs Bob's 5%), I'll propose a division that's somewhat in my favor but still appealing enough for Bob to consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because if Bob rejects it, my money will be worth 20% less in the next round, while his will only decrease by 5%. This gives him an incentive to consider accepting now rather than waiting for a potentially better deal that would be worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
   * My $50 is worth only 80% of original value = $40 effective value
   * Bob's $50 is worth 95% of original value = $47.50 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (60% for me, 90% for Bob)
   * I'd need to make a significantly better offer to get equivalent value
   * Bob might reject again, leading to further inflation losses

Given that the inflation rate affects me more severely (20% vs 5%), and this is a fair split in nominal terms, it's better to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
