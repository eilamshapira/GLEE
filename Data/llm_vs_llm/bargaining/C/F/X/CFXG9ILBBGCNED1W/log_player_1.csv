"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and accepting now means you get the full value of your share without any inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid any further loss due to inflation. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer now:
$500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 (real value for me)

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, it will be worth even less due to continued inflation. And there's no guarantee Bob would accept.

This is actually a decent offer considering the inflation impact, and getting a deal now is better than risking further devaluation.
