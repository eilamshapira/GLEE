"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair offer to Bob that takes into account the inflation penalty for delaying.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally. A 50-50 split is fair to both of us, and accepting now maximizes our total gain since delaying would reduce the total value by 20% each round."
