"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, but also tries to maximize my gain. Given that I face 5% inflation per round, there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than move to the next round where both our potential gains would be affected by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Bob is proposing that I receive $450,000 and he receives $550,000, which is essentially the reverse of my initial offer.

Due to inflation, my $450,000 is now worth 5% less than the first round's value, making it equivalent to $427,500 in round 1 value. If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less than round 1 value.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, and we could end up with nothing after 12 rounds. The inflation penalty makes early agreement beneficial.
