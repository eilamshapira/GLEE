"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 45, but it's worth 19% less, so it's approximately 45 * 0.81 = 36.45. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less in round 2 and another 10% less in round 3, and now another 10% less in round 4, so it's worth approximately 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.81 = 0.6561 of the original value.

To maximize my gain, I'll try to get a larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 50, but it's worth 34.39% less, so it's approximately 50 * 0.6561 = 32.805. 

However, since Alice's offer gives us an equal split, it's a relatively fair offer. Given the significant inflation and the fact that I've already lost around 34.39% of the value, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses.
