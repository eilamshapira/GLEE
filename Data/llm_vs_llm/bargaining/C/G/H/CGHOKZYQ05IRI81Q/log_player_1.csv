"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the declining value of the money for him over time. I also need to factor in that I have more rounds to make offers if he rejects this one.

Here's my initial offer, designed to be somewhat fair but with a slight advantage for me, hoping for a quick resolution:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 5000/5000. Let's analyze.

For me, 5000 now is worth the same as 5000 in round 1.

For Bob, 5000 now is worth 5% less than 5000 in round 1. That means it's equivalent to 5000 * 0.95 = 4750 from round 1.

If I reject, I'll have to make another offer in the next round, and the value of Bob's money decreases again. My money doesn't decrease in value, so I have that advantage.

Given that my potential gain doesn't decrease and Bob's does, and the offer is already at 50/50, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
