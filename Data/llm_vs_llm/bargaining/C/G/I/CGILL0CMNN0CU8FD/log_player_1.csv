"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares and prevents further inflation from reducing the total value. If we keep negotiating, we both lose money due to inflation, so this split maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $50, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $40 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (40% less than original value)
- Bob's 50-50 split appears fair on the surface
- Given the steep inflation penalty I face, getting $40 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation
