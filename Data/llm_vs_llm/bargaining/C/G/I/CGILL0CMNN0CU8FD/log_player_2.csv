"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is reasonable, given that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 5% each round.

Right now, I can get $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $40 now.

If I reject, the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split then, I'd get $47.50, which is better than $40 now. But Alice might reject that offer too, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given the uncertainty and the inflation penalty, I think I can do better by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure while aiming for a more equal split.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares and prevents further inflation from reducing the total value. If we keep negotiating, we both lose money due to inflation, so this split maximizes our combined outcome.""}"
