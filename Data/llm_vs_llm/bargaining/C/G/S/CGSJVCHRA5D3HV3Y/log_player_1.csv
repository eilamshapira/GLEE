"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for inflation. This is still a fair split considering the delay. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I calculate that my gain of $4750 is actually worth $4750 * 0.9 = $4275.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, the money I gain is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

To account for this, I'll make an offer that gives me a slightly larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but this offer is fair considering the delay and the decreasing value of the money. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, I calculate that my gain of $4900 is actually worth $4900 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = $3572.1.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems more reasonable than my previous calculations. I think it's time to settle and avoid further inflation.
