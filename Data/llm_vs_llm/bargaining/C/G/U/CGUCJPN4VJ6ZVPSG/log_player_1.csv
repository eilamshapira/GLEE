"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic in my first offer. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, I want to reach a fair agreement quickly while maximizing my share. I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives Bob a good portion to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob countered my first offer by simply flipping the numbers. Given that inflation affects me more (10% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round), I should try to reach an agreement relatively soon, but I still want to negotiate for a fair share. I'll make a more balanced offer.
