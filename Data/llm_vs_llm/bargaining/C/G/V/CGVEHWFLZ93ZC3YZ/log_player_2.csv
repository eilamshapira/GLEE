"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Since Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round while I don't, her $60 would only be worth $54 to her in the next round. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I can likely propose a more favorable split in the next round, taking advantage of this asymmetric inflation pressure on Alice. She would be more likely to accept a higher amount for me since her money is worth less each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm now making the offer and Alice faces 10% inflation per round, I should propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being acceptable to Alice to avoid further rounds where her share would be worth even less.

If Alice rejects my offer, in the next round the money would be worth 10% less to her again, so she has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now.

I'll propose a 65-35 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35}

This is significantly better for me than her initial offer, but still gives Alice a meaningful share that's worth more to her now than potentially getting more in a future round due to the inflation effect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from the initial 40-60 split to a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, her $50 is actually only worth about $40.50 to her (81% of $50)
3. My $50 maintains its full value since I don't face inflation
4. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth even less (29% less than initial)
   - I maintain full value

While this is a better offer than her first one, I can still leverage the inflation pressure on Alice to potentially get a better deal in the next round. The fact that her money is losing value quickly means she should be more willing to accept a higher split in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 4:
1. For Alice, money is worth 29% less than in round 1
2. My money maintains its value
3. If Alice rejects this offer, in the next round her money will be worth 39% less than initial value

Alice needs to seriously consider accepting now because her purchasing power is significantly diminishing. Her previous offer of 50-50 shows she's becoming more accommodating, but she's still not fully accounting for her inflation disadvantage.

I'll propose a 75-25 split:

{""bob_gain"": 75,
""alice_gain"": 25}

This might seem aggressive, but from Alice's perspective:
- If she accepts now, her $25 is worth about $17.75 (71% of $25)
- If she rejects and we go another round, even a larger share would be worth less to her due to continuing inflation
- She should be motivated to end the game now"
