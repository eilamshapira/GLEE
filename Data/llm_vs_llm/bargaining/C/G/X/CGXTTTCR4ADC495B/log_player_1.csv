"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that inflation affects Bob more than me, which gives me slightly more bargaining power. I'm still offering you a substantial portion, and accepting now guarantees you $40 rather than risking further depreciation of your share in later rounds."
