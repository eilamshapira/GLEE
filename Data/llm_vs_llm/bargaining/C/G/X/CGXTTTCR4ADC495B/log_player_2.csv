"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 and taking $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. $40 now is better than $42.11 in the next round (due to the 5% inflation)
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation or reaching round 12 with no agreement

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty affects only me, I'll accept.
