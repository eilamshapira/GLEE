"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the $10000 evenlyâ€”$5000 each. By agreeing in this first round, we both avoid any losses from inflation on my side. I believe a fair and immediate agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round's $5000 would be worth 5% less to me (only $4750)
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further losses
4. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair
5. Getting the money immediately prevents any inflation loss

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk and the fairness of the split, I should accept this offer.
