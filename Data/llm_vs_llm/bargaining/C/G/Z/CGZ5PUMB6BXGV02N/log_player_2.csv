"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
* If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
* However, due to 20% inflation per round for me:
  * My $4,000 now would be worth more than $4,000 in future rounds
  * Next round, each dollar will only be worth 80 cents to me
  * My bargaining power decreases each round while Alice's stays the same

While 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting $4,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in later rounds.
