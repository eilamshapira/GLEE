"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer to divide the $100. Given that inflation impacts Bob's value of the money more than mine, I want to propose something fair that accounts for this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, Bob. Since we both know the money will be worth 20% less to you next round if you reject, this is a favorable offer for you to accept now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the progression of offers and the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's utility, I'll make a revised offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

Bob, I'm offering you $45 now, which is a better deal for you than waiting another round. If we go to round 4, the money will be worth even less to you due to the 20% inflation effect. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 5 and Bob has rejected my previous offers despite the increasing impact of inflation on his value, I'll make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly even split of $50 each. At this point, the money is significantly devalued for you due to inflation (about 59% less valuable than in round 1), so accepting this equal division now would be in your best interest. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions."
