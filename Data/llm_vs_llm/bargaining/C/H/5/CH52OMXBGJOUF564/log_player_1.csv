"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new values. My money is now worth less due to inflation. Let's calculate the effective values, taking into account the inflation:

My effective gain: 45 * 0.8 = 36
Bob's effective gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

Therefore, I would like to **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, remembering that my money is now worth even less due to inflation:

I will offer to split it 50/50.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
