"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it's still a fair offer to start the negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's better than getting nothing if he rejects and we move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  Since it's my turn to make a proposal, I'll see if I can secure a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still feeling the effects of inflation, so I'm going to try to secure a bigger portion of the money in this round. This offer is more in line with my initial proposal, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm still unhappy with the loss due to inflation, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split.  Considering the rounds we've played so far, it's unlikely we'll reach a better deal.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the available money."
