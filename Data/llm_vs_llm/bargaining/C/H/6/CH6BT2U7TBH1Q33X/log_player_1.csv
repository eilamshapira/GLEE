"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to secure an immediate agreement and to protect you from any unforeseen inflation effects, I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I believe this offer is fair given the potential risks of waiting. Let's settle this now and move forward together! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
