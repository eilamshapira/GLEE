"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I think we should get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I want to end this quickly, I'm not going to accept a nearly insignificant amount. Alice clearly undervalues my position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice. It accounts for the fact that delays hurt me more than you.""
}
``` 

This offer reflects the urgency I feel due to the higher inflation rate applied to me. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate reasonably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this offer reflects the fact that inflation is impacting us both, and I'm more willing to wait than you are. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation difference. While the offer is better than the first, it's still far from reasonable. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a compromise that considers the time pressure.""
}
``` 

I'm bringing my offer down slightly to show flexibility, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share due to the inflation disparity.  It's time for Alice to make a serious counter-offer."
