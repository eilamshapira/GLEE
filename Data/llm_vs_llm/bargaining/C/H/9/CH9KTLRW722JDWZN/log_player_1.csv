"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, taking into account that Bob's money devalues faster than mine. Since we both want to maximize our gains and avoid multiple rounds of negotiation (which would reduce the value for both of us), I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob to incentivize immediate acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives Bob a majority share (55%)
2. It's a fair offer that respects both our interests
3. If Bob rejects and we go to next round, both our shares will be worth less (mine by 5%, his by 10%)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (worth 95% of original value) = $380,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 (worth 90% of original value) = $540,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 90% of original
   * Bob's will be worth 80% of original
   * I'll have another chance to make an offer

The offer isn't terrible, but I think I can do better. Given that Bob's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I have a slight advantage in negotiations. By rejecting, I can make a new offer that might be more favorable to me, while still being attractive to Bob given the increasing devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3:
- My share will be worth 90% of original value
- Bob's share will be worth 80% of original value

I'll make a more assertive offer, but still keeping it attractive enough for Bob considering the increasing devaluation he faces:

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

This offer means:
- My effective value: $525,000 × 90% = $472,500
- Bob's effective value: $475,000 × 80% = $380,000

This is still a reasonable offer for Bob because if he rejects, his next round's money will be worth only 70% of original value, significantly diminishing any potential gains from further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 × (1 - 0.1426) = $385,830 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 × (1 - 0.271) = $401,050 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth ~19% less than original
   * Bob's will be worth ~34% less than original
   * The value is deteriorating quickly for both of us

Given that:
1. This is a reasonable offer (close to 50-50 in effective value)
2. We're already in round 4 and values are decreasing significantly
3. The risk of further deterioration is high
4. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate reasonably

I'll accept this offer to avoid further value loss for both parties.
