Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a middle ground. With a 55/45 split, I believe this offer is fair given the depreciation factor for you. This ensures you still secure a significant amount before it loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
