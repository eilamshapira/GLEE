"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100, considering the inflation effect for me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that if we move to another round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Although I'm getting $45 instead of the $60 I proposed initially, due to the 10% inflation, any amount I would receive in future rounds would be worth even less to me. This $45 is worth more to me now than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds with compounding inflation."
