"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects both of us, but more severely affects him. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $4000, which seems like a fair initial offer, leaving me with $6000. I believe this gives Bob a reasonable incentive to accept, avoiding the value decay in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the value decay before making my decision.

*   **Alice's perspective:** $4500 in this round is worth 5% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** $5500 in this round is worth 10% less than in round 1.

My goal is to maximize my gain considering the inflation. I need to decide if $4500 now is better than what I might get in a future round, considering further value decay.

Let's analyze: Bob is offering $5500, while I will get $4500.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning: $4500 is not enough considering the initial $10,000 and the risk of further degradation of the money value in next rounds. I'll try to get a bigger piece of the pie in the next round when it's my turn to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make the offer again. I need to balance getting a good portion for myself with making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept, especially considering the inflation that's hitting him harder.

The money is now worth 10% less to me compared to the initial value, and 20% less to Bob. I will structure my offer considering this:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6300,
""bob_gain"": 3700
}
```

Reasoning:

*   I'm asking for $6300. This is slightly more than my previous offer to Bob, but I consider the value degradation.
*   Bob gets $3700. Although it's lower than his previous offer, the money is worth even less now, so this might still be attractive to him.
* I'm betting that Bob will find $3700 now more attractive than what he might get in the future, given that his money is decaying faster than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting serious. The inflation is really starting to bite, especially for Bob. Let's analyze the offer:

*   **Alice's perspective:** $5000 is worth 14.26% less than the original value.
*   **Bob's perspective:** $5000 is worth 27.1% less than the original value.

Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, that could still be a reasonable deal for me. Let's do a quick comparison:

*   If I reject, my potential future gain will be even further devalued.
*   Accepting gives me $5000, which, even with the devaluation, is still significant.

Given that Bob is losing value much faster, I think he's likely close to his breaking point. Trying to squeeze more out of him might be risky.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: I'm accepting to avoid future losses due to inflation. A 50/50 split at this stage, considering the depreciation, is a reasonable outcome. I prefer to secure the $5000 (devalued, of course) rather than risk a potentially much smaller amount in a future round."
