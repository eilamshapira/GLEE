"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering there's inflation pressure but also wanting to start with a fair proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a slightly favorable split for me but still quite fair, giving Bob a significant portion. Since inflation will affect future rounds for me, I want to secure a decent amount now while still making an offer that Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 20% inflation on my side, getting $100 (worth $80 after inflation) is much better than making a counter-offer where the money would be worth even less in the next round. This is actually a very favorable offer for me, as I get the entire amount. While it might seem unusual that Bob offered me everything, I won't question this generous proposal."
