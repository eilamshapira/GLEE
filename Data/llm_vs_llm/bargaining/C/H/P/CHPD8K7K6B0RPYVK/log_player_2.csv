"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to sidestep future inflation losses on my side, I propose a quick agreement: I take $45 and you get $55. Let's secure our gains now before the value drops. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $55 while taking $45 for herself. Given that the money loses 10% of its value for me each round, accepting now would give me the full $55. If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I get more dollars, they'll be worth less due to inflation.

Let's calculate: If I reject now and propose a better split next round, the maximum I could get would be $100, but that would be worth only $90 to me due to 10% inflation. And Alice might reject that anyway, causing further rounds and more inflation.

Since $55 now is better than potentially getting nothing or a depreciated amount later, and it's a reasonable split in my favor, I'll accept.
