"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose to divide the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. I think this is a fair offer considering the upcoming inflation impact for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, am offered $45. Alice is taking $55.

If I reject, the money is worth 20% less for me. So the $45 would have to become roughly $45/(1-0.20) = $45/0.8 = $56.25 to have the same value in the next round.
For Alice, the $55 would have to become $55/(1-0.05) = $55/0.95 = $57.89 to have the same value in the next round.

This means that in the next round, I would have to propose something like $57.89 for Alice to accept, which would leave me with $42.11. So in this case, it's better to accept now.
