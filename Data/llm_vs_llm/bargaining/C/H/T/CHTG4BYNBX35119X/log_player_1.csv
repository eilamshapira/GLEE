"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1, considering the potential for inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my share. My initial offer was for $6000, but now $10,000 is worth 10% less to me. Let's do the math:

*   My offer in round 1: $6000
*   Bob's offer now: Alice gets $4500.

Since I know I'll lose value with each round, I need to determine if $4500 now is better than any potential future offer (which will be worth even less). Given the potential for Bob to get a larger share in the next round, I will accept.
