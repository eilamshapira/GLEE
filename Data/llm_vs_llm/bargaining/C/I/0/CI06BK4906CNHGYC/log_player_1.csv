"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, his share will be worth less in the next round due to his 10% inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept: I get $45 at full value
2. If I reject: 
   - We go to round 3
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - My money maintains its value
   - This gives me more negotiating power

Since Bob's purchasing power is decreasing each round, and my initial offer of 60/40 was reasonable, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money has already lost 20% of its value compared to round 1. This means Bob should be more motivated to accept a deal now rather than continue negotiating. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. Given that Bob's money is worth 20% less now, and would lose another 10% if they reject this offer, they should seriously consider accepting this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept: I get $48 at full value
2. If I reject:
   - We go to round 5
   - Bob's money will be worth about 35% less than round 1
   - My money still maintains its value
   - However, we're getting deep into negotiations and should consider ending this

Bob has increased their offer to me from $45 to $48, showing some willingness to compromise. However, given that their purchasing power continues to decrease significantly (now at -27.1%), I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 5, Bob's money has lost about 34% of its value compared to round 1. Bob really needs to reach an agreement soon to avoid further devaluation of their share. Given this strong position, I'll make a firm offer that's slightly more favorable to me than my last one.

{""alice_gain"": 68, ""bob_gain"": 32}

I propose I get $68 and Bob gets $32. This offer reflects the reality that Bob's purchasing power has significantly decreased, and will decrease even further if they reject this offer. It's in their best interest to accept now rather than continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept: I get $50 at full value
2. If I reject:
   - We go to round 7
   - Bob's money will be worth about 47% less than round 1
   - While I could potentially get more, there's also a risk of prolonging the game unnecessarily

Bob has increased their offer to me from $48 to $50, showing continued willingness to compromise. While I believe I have a stronger negotiating position due to their significant inflation penalty (currently at -41%), we're now quite deep into negotiations. Bob has moved to a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair, and further rounds might lead to diminishing returns.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
