Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is biting, let's find a middle ground before it's too late. This split should be more reasonable considering the decreased value. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value rapidly for both of us. While I don't know how Bob is affected,  waiting any longer significantly risks getting even less.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 5 isn't worth the risk. The potential gain is small compared to the potential loss if Bob plays hardball. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share. Rejecting leads to further uncertainty and potential for an even worse outcome in later rounds."
