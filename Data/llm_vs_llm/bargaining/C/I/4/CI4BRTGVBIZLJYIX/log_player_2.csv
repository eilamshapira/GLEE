"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this share reflects the value better after two rounds of inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the total value for me has decreased by 9.75% in round 2 and another 5% in round 3, making it a total decrease of 14.7625% (1 - (0.95 * 0.9025)). For simplicity, let's calculate the effective amount after inflation: $10,000 * 0.8525 = $8,525.
