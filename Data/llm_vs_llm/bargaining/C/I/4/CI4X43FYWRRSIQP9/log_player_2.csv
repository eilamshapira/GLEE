"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's both win here! I propose I receive $550000 and you get $450000. This way, we can end the game without losing any value. Would you agree to this offer? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $450,000, Alice gets $550,000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * BUT my money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * $450,000 now > $500,000 Ã— 0.9 in next round

While I could counter-offer in the next round, the 10% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more money to make up for the loss. Even if I proposed a more favorable split, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value decay.

$450,000 right now is a reasonable offer, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes it worthwhile to accept.
