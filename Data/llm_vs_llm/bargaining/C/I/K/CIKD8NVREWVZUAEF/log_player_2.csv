"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is in my best interest at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to me. Accepting now cuts my losses from further inflation.
* **Alice's position:** Alice is likely to continue pushing for a larger share, knowing the money devalues faster for me.  

Waiting for a better offer in a future round is too risky given the rapid devaluation of the money."
