"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $40 while she gets $60. If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a proposal, but the total amount will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and move to the next round, the maximum I could get would be from the $80 (after my inflation), and Alice might not accept a very uneven split.
