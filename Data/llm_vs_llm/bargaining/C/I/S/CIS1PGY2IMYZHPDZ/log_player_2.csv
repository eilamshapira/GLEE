"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me, meaning the $100 will effectively be worth $95 from my perspective.

If I reject and propose a better split next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation.

$45 right now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pie later, considering the inflation penalty.
