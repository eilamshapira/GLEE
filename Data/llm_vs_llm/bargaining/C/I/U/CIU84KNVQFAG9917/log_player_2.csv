"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject this, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, but I need to consider the 20% inflation penalty that only affects me.

In the next round, the money would be worth 20% less to me, so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. That means I should only reject if I believe I can secure more than $400,000 of that $800,000 value in the next round.

Given that Alice faces no inflation penalty and knows I'm under time pressure, this initial offer of 40% for me isn't terrible. However, I believe I can do better by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable while accounting for my inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair division that benefits us both. While I face the inflation penalty, a 50-50 split still gives me more value than your initial offer, and it's a standard equitable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $450,000 for me and $550,000 for herself. I need to evaluate this carefully.

Due to the 36% inflation that affects only me, the $450,000 offer is actually worth $450,000 × 0.64 = $288,000 in round 1 terms for me.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 4, I'll face 48% cumulative inflation (20% more). Any amount would be worth only 52% of its original value to me.

Given that Alice has moved from 60/40 to 55/45 split, she's showing some willingness to negotiate. However, this offer still gives me less effective value than her initial offer (which would have been worth $400,000 × 0.64 = $256,000 in current terms).

Since she's improved her offer and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept this offer.
