"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a perfectly equal split (50-50)
2. If I reject, in the next round the total value will be $95 due to 5% inflation
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further value loss
4. This is a fair offer right from the start
