"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This way we both get a good amount and can avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
The offer isn't quite fair - Alice is trying to take more than half. While 45$ is still a decent amount, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. The 5% inflation means we'll be dividing 95$ instead of 100$, but I could propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, accounting for the fact that Alice made the first move but also emphasizing fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution. We're both losing value to inflation by negotiating, so let's make it equal and finish this now.""}"
