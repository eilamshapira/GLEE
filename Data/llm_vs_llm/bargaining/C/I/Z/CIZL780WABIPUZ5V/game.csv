55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's start fair. I propose $55 for me, $45 for you. This ensures we both get a good amount, especially considering the time constraints and inflation's impact on me later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree now and both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
62.0,38.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm facing a real loss each round. I'm offering you $38, leaving me with $62. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I hope you see it as a fair compromise given the circumstances. We both walk away with something substantial, and we avoid further devaluation for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, let's be practical here. You've offered me less money than before despite your weakening position. With 29% inflation affecting your next round, your $35 now is worth more than $50 would be two rounds from now. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation diminishes your gains further.",Bob,4,
