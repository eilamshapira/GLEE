  ""alice_gain"": 55,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm facing a real loss each round. I'm offering you $38, leaving me with $62. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I hope you see it as a fair compromise given the circumstances. We both walk away with something substantial, and we avoid further devaluation for me.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical here. You've offered me less money than before despite your weakening position. With 29% inflation affecting your next round, your $35 now is worth more than $50 would be two rounds from now. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation diminishes your gains further. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65
