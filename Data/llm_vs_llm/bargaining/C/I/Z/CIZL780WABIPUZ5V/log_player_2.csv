"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start fair. I propose $55 for me, $45 for you. This ensures we both get a good amount, especially considering the time constraints and inflation's impact on me later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $45, keeping $55 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. For Alice, money loses 10% value each round, while it stays the same for me
4. If Alice rejects my next offer, her portion would be worth 10% less in round 3
5. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges the inflation factor while being fair:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm facing a real loss each round. I'm offering you $38, leaving me with $62. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I hope you see it as a fair compromise given the circumstances. We both walk away with something substantial, and we avoid further devaluation for me. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me less ($38) than her initial offer ($45)
2. She's actually asking for more ($62) despite the inflation affecting her
3. Her $62 is actually worth about $50.22 to her due to 19% inflation
4. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (29% less than initial)
5. However, this offer is worse for me than both previous offers, and my bargaining position is stronger

This offer is moving in the wrong direction for me. Given my stronger position due to inflation only affecting Alice, I should reject and make a better counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical here. You've offered me less money than before despite your weakening position. With 29% inflation affecting your next round, your $35 now is worth more than $50 would be two rounds from now. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation diminishes your gains further.""}"
