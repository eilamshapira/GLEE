"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you next round, making any future deal less valuable for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor.  This is fair considering the money is worth less to you with each passing round.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which is still worth full value to me
2. Bob would get $550,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $440,000 to him
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount Bob would get would be worth another 20% less to him
4. This weakens Bob's negotiating position further, so I could potentially get a better deal
5. However, there's also a risk of prolonging negotiations

Given that I could likely get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's weakening position, I'll reject this offer.
