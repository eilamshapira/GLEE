"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you next round, making any future deal less valuable for you.

# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that money is now worth 40% less to you due to inflation, this $300000 offer is actually worth only $180000 to you. If you reject, it will be worth even less next round. This is your best option now - I suggest you take it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
