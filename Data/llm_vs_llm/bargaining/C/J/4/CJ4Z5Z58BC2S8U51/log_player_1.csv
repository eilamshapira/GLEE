"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the diminishing value of the money with each round. Since it's the first round, I'll aim for a fair split that also favors me slightly, considering I'm Alice.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. I need to consider the inflation.

If I accept, I get $40, which is worth 5% less than in round 1.
If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, and I'll have to make a proposal.

Let's calculate the present value of $40 in this round compared to a potential offer in the next round.
Current Value of accepting $40: $40 * (1 - 0.05) = $38

If I reject, the money is worth 10% less. So I have to get a bigger amount in the future.
I think $40 is too low. I'll reject and try to get more in the next round, considering my inflation is lower than Bob's.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Now, the money is worth 10% less for me than in the first round, and 20% less for Bob. I need to consider this to make a proposal that is both acceptable to Bob and beneficial to me. I will be a little more aggressive since it is round 3.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 62,
""bob_gain"": 38
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze Bob's offer carefully, considering the inflation rates.

If I accept, I get $35, which is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. That means the actual value for me is $35 * (1 - 0.1426) = $30.001

If I reject, I have to make an offer in the next round. My money will be worth 19.02% less than in round 1, and Bob's will be worth 34.39% less.

$30 is not great, and I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject and make an offer in the next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. The inflation is becoming more significant. I need to make a reasonable offer to avoid further losses. My money is worth 19.02% less, and Bob's is worth 34.39% less.

I will aim for a split that is slightly more favorable to me but still attractive to Bob, hoping he accepts this time.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob's offer is $30, which is worth 22.62% less for me than the original $100. Let's calculate the present value:

$30 * (1 - 0.2262) = $23.214

If I reject, my money will be worth 25.76% less in the next round, and Bob's will be worth 46.86% less. $23 is very low. I'm going to reject and make a counter offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, this is getting risky with the rapidly increasing inflation. My money is worth 25.76% less, and Bob's is worth 46.86% less. I need to make a deal this time. I will make a more appealing offer to Bob, trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself while considering his diminishing value.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering $25, but it's worth 30.17% less for me due to inflation. Let's calculate the present value:

$25 * (1 - 0.3017) = $17.4575

If I reject, my money will be worth 34.2% less in the next round, and Bob's will be worth 56.89% less. This is becoming a very small amount. $17.45 is awful.

I am going to reject this offer, and hope that I can get a better one by giving Bob a bigger amount.

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I really need to make this offer count. My money is now worth 34.2% less, and Bob's is worth 56.89% less. I will make a very generous offer to Bob to try and get him to accept this time.
