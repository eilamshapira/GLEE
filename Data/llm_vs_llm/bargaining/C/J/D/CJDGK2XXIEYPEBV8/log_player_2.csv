"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect that reduces the value by 10% each round.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me. So if I were to get the full $10,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $9,000 to me due to inflation.

A guaranteed $5,000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds after inflation. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
