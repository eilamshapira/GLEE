Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're aiming higher, how about a 55-45 split in your favor? It's a fair compromise considering our last offers. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with inflation, I'm aiming for a better deal. It's still early in the game."

# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point, considering the inflation."
