6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% depreciation per round, taking this offer now is better than waiting.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the depreciation I face, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split seems fair, as we both get a considerable amount and it's better for me to settle now rather than lose more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Your money depreciates 20% each round while mine doesn't. If you reject this, your next round's $3500 will only be worth $2800 to you. This is a fair offer given our positions.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but I'm not ready to give up on a fair split. Given the unique circumstances, I'm willing to meet in the middle. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution, and I'm willing to take the depreciation hit for the sake of fairness.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 48.8% depreciation you've already faced, even a $5000 offer is only worth $2560 to you now. My offer of $3000 is worth $1536 to you, but if you reject and we continue, the depreciation will make any future amount worth even less. This is your best remaining option.",Alice,5,
