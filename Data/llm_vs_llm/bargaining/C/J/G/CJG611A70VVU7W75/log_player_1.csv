"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the depreciation I face, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split seems fair, as we both get a considerable amount and it's better for me to settle now rather than lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money Bob gets depreciates by 20% each round, while mine doesn't depreciate at all. I have a stronger negotiating position, so I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Your money depreciates 20% each round while mine doesn't. If you reject this, your next round's $3500 will only be worth $2800 to you. This is a fair offer given our positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but I'm not ready to give up on a fair split. Given the unique circumstances, I'm willing to meet in the middle. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution, and I'm willing to take the depreciation hit for the sake of fairness. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The fact that Bob's money depreciates by 20% each round while mine doesn't means a 50-50 split isn't actually fair - his $5000 is only worth about $2560 to him now due to the 48.8% depreciation. I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 48.8% depreciation you've already faced, even a $5000 offer is only worth $2560 to you now. My offer of $3000 is worth $1536 to you, but if you reject and we continue, the depreciation will make any future amount worth even less. This is your best remaining option.""}"
