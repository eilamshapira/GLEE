"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% depreciation per round, taking this offer now is better than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the depreciation I face, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split seems fair, as we both get a considerable amount and it's better for me to settle now rather than lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. Your money depreciates 20% each round while mine doesn't. If you reject this, your next round's $3500 will only be worth $2800 to you. This is a fair offer given our positions. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point, but I'm not ready to give up on a fair split. Given the unique circumstances, I'm willing to meet in the middle. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution, and I'm willing to take the depreciation hit for the sake of fairness.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 48.8% depreciation you've already faced, even a $5000 offer is only worth $2560 to you now. My offer of $3000 is worth $1536 to you, but if you reject and we continue, the depreciation will make any future amount worth even less. This is your best remaining option. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
