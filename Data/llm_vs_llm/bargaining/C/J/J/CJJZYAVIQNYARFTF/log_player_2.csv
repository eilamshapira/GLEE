"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With a 20% inflation per round, if I reject and propose in the next round, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me. 

Alice is offering me $40 now, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject, even if I propose a 50-50 split next round ($50 for me), that $50 would only be worth $40 to me due to inflation, which is the same as Alice's current offer.

Given the inflation pressure and uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, I should accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk further depreciation.
