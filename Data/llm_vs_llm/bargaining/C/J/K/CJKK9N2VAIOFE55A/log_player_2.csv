"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. However, if I reject, I can make a counteroffer in the next round. But then the money would be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $5000 would effectively be worth only $4000.

Making a higher demand in the next round might lead Alice to reject, and we could enter a cycle where my share keeps losing value due to inflation.

The current offer of $5000 is the highest real value I can get, so I should accept.
