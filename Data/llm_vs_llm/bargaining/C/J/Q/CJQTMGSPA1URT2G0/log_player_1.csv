"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation effect for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round, accepting now gives him more value than waiting for later rounds, even with a potentially higher dollar amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to find a more acceptable split.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. Bob, considering you face 20% inflation each round, this $4,500 now is worth more than waiting for a potentially better split in future rounds where your purchasing power will decrease further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more accommodating offer considering our progress through the rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split where I get $5,000 and you get $5,000. Bob, this is a fair division, and given that we're now in round 5 with the inflation effect compounding for you, this $5,000 now has significantly more value than waiting for later rounds."
