"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. If I accept, I get $4,000 now. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

Looking at the offer - Alice is taking 60% ($6,000) and offering me 40% ($4,000). That's not an equal split, but I need to account for inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value for me would be subject to 20% inflation.

I think I can do better by making a counter-offer in the next round, even with the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while accounting for the inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage to offset the inflation penalty I've already incurred. It's also more balanced than Alice's initial offer where she wanted 60% for herself. I hope Alice recognizes that this is a reasonable counter-offer that leaves us both with a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1 ($4,000 → $4,200 for me), but we're now in round 3, and the inflation effect on my gains is significant (36% less value).

My $4,200 with 36% inflation is effectively worth $4,200 × (1-0.36) = $2,688 in round 1 terms.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where inflation will be even higher for me (likely around 48% less value), and I'll make the next offer. But Alice has only slightly increased her offer, suggesting she may be willing to continue the negotiation.

Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the small increase in Alice's offer, I should accept this offer before the money loses more value for me.
