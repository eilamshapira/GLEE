500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split which seems fair to both of us. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable considering the risk I'm taking.  Let's close this deal now and both enjoy our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I see you want more than an equal split. I'm offering you 48% which is still quite fair. I notice the inflation is affecting your gains each round, so it's in your interest to close this deal soon. This offer gives you a very good outcome compared to waiting further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and this money is losing value fast. Let's agree on a 58/42 split and end this. This offer is a good compromise considering the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I notice you're facing significant inflation - your money is now worth almost 50% less than in round 1. This means if we keep going, your eventual share becomes less valuable. Let's be fair with a 50/50 split. This gives you $500000 now, which is much better than a larger nominal amount later when inflation will have reduced its real value even further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the inflation, but I'm willing to take the risk for a slightly larger share. 55/45 is my final offer. Let's get this done.",Bob,6,
