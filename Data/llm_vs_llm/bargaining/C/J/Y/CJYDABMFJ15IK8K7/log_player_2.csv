"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split which seems fair to both of us. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you want more than an equal split. I'm offering you 48% which is still quite fair. I notice the inflation is affecting your gains each round, so it's in your interest to close this deal soon. This offer gives you a very good outcome compared to waiting further.

# Alice gain: 520000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice you're facing significant inflation - your money is now worth almost 50% less than in round 1. This means if we keep going, your eventual share becomes less valuable. Let's be fair with a 50/50 split. This gives you $500000 now, which is much better than a larger nominal amount later when inflation will have reduced its real value even further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
