550000.0,450000.0,"I'm offering you a generous $450000 (45%). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, delaying would reduce our total value. This is a fair split that benefits us both without unnecessary loss.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but I too need to consider my inflation impact. I'm proposing a split where I receive $600000. This split takes into account the reduction in value over time for me. Let's finalize this deal now.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I now understand you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, which is significantly higher than my 5%. This actually gives you more incentive to accept a deal now. I'm offering you $480000, which is better than my first offer. If you reject and we go another round, your inflation will severely reduce your value. This is a fair split that recognizes our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
