"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic first offer to Bob, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I want to claim a fair share while acknowledging that Bob has the power to reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I'm offering you a generous $450,000 (45%). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, delaying would reduce our total value. This is a fair split that benefits us both without unnecessary loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I too need to consider my inflation impact. I'm proposing a split where I receive $600000. This split takes into account the reduction in value over time for me. Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's reveal that he faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, which is much higher than my 5%. This gives me more leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I now understand you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, which is significantly higher than my 5%. This actually gives you more incentive to accept a deal now. I'm offering you $480,000, which is better than my first offer. If you reject and we go another round, your inflation will severely reduce your value. This is a fair split that recognizes our different inflation rates.""}"
