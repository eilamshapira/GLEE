"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a generous $450000 (45%). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, delaying would reduce our total value. This is a fair split that benefits us both without unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, but I too need to consider my inflation impact. I'm proposing a split where I receive $600,000. This split takes into account the reduction in value over time for me. Let's finalize this deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I now understand you face a 20% inflation penalty per round, which is significantly higher than my 5%. This actually gives you more incentive to accept a deal now. I'm offering you $480000, which is better than my first offer. If you reject and we go another round, your inflation will severely reduce your value. This is a fair split that recognizes our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
