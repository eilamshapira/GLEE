"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer. Since we both need to agree and there's a risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split to show goodwill and encourage cooperation. Bob gets a bit more than half, which should make the offer attractive while still securing a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. For me (Alice), I would get $500,000 at full value
2. For Bob, he would get $500,000, but it's worth 10% less to him due to inflation
3. This is actually a better offer than what I proposed in round 1 (where I offered myself $450,000)
4. If I reject, we'll move to round 3 where inflation will be even worse for Bob
5. The offer is fair and gives me half of the total amount

Given these factors, it's a reasonable offer that benefits me more than my initial proposal, and there's risk in continuing further.
