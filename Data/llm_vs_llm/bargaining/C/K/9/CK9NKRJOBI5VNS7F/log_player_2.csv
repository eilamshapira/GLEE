"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this rationally:

1. The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $4,000 now > $4,800 next round (worth $3,840 after inflation)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued inflation and potential further negotiations makes this a decent offer

The offer isn't terrible, but I think I can get a better deal in the next round, even accounting for inflation. I'll reject this and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that we both need to agree and that inflation affects my gains:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and should be appealing to Alice. This is better than prolonging negotiations while inflation eats away at the value. With a perfectly equal split, there's no clear reason for Alice to reject, and it gives me $1000 more than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer gives me $4,200, but with 36% inflation, it's actually worth $2,688 to me
2. Her first offer of $4,000 would have been worth $4,000 (no inflation)
3. The inflation rate is affecting me much more severely than Alice (36% vs 9.75%)
4. We have 9 rounds left, but each round makes the money significantly less valuable for me
5. Alice seems to be in a stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric inflation

Given that:
- The inflation is hitting me much harder than Alice
- Further delays will significantly reduce the value for me
- Alice has only slightly improved her offer, suggesting she's willing to wait
- My 50-50 split was rejected

I should accept this offer before inflation erodes more value.
