"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally. This way, we both get a good amount. Consider that the money loses value for me each round, so it's in my interest to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
