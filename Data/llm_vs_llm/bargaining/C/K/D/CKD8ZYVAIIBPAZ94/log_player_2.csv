"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.
For Alice, the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
