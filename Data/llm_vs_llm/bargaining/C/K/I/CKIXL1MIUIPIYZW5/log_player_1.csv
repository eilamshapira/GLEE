"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's make this simple and fair. We avoid inflation if we agree now. I propose $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, as the proposer in round 2 I want us both to avoid further discounting. If you reject, you'll have to wait until round 3 where you'll propose, but the total value drops by 20% again. Accepting this now gives you $4444, which matches what you'd get if you delayed. Let's agree now and maximize our earnings! 
# Alice gain: 4444 
# Bob gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
