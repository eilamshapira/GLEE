"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's make this simple and fair. We avoid inflation if we agree now. I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5556, ""alice_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, as the proposer in round 2 I want us both to avoid further discounting. If you reject, you'll have to wait until round 3 where you'll propose, but the total value drops by 20% again. Accepting this now gives you $4444, which matches what you'd get if you delayed. Let's agree now and maximize our earnings!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's find a middle ground. With each round, the total value diminishes, and I think $5200 for me and $4800 for you is a reasonable split. Let's finalize this and avoid further loss. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
