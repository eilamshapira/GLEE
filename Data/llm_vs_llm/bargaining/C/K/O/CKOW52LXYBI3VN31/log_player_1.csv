"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the $10,000 equally so both of us can enjoy a fair share. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you value every dollar as is, while my money loses value with each round. To avoid dragging this out (and to keep my losses minimal), I'm offering you $9500 and keeping only $500 for myself. I believe this generous split reflects the current circumstancesâ€”please accept, and we can both walk away quickly before any further devaluation hits. 
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
