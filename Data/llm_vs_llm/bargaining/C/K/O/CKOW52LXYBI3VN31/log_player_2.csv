Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500, ""alice_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you value every dollar as is, while my money loses value with each round. To avoid dragging this out (and to keep my losses minimal), I'm offering you $9,500 and keeping only $500 for myself. I believe this generous split reflects the current circumstancesâ€”please accept, and we can both walk away quickly before any further devaluation hits.""}"
