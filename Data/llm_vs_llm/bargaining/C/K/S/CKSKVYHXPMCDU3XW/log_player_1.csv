"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of going to the next round. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with the 10% inflation penalty for the next round, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal. The current offer of 45$ is significantly lower than my initial proposal, and I believe we can find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. This 55-45 split is fair and balanced. Remember that with each round, inflation reduces the value for both of us. Let's reach an agreement now and avoid further devaluation of the money.""}"
