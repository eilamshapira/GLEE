"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. This 55-45 split is fair and balanced. Remember that with each round, inflation reduces the value for both of us. Let's reach an agreement now and avoid further devaluation of the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
