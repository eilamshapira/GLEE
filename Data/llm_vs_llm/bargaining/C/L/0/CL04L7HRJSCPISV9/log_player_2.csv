"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $410,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, which is 41% of the total.

Given that inflation affects Alice more than me (her money loses 10% value each round while mine loses 0%), I have an advantage in later rounds. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice would have more incentive to accept my offer in the next round since waiting would decrease her money's value.

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, so I'll reject this initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation asymmetry while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair division considering that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I face no inflation. If we continue to future rounds, Alice's potential gain will decrease in value, so accepting a slightly smaller portion now is still beneficial to her compared to potentially getting even less value in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now offering me $470,000, which is $60,000 more than her initial offer.

Looking at the situation:
- Alice is now offering me 47% of the total (up from 41%)
- Alice's money has already lost 19% of its value due to inflation
- If I reject again, her next round's money will be worth 27.1% less than the original value
- I face no inflation penalty

Alice's offer has improved significantly, but I can potentially get an even better deal if I make another counter-offer. However, there's also the risk that we might not reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

Given the improving trajectory of offers and the inflation pressure on Alice, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll increase my offer to Alice slightly to make it more appealing while still taking advantage of the inflation asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I propose that I receive $580,000 and Alice receives $420,000. This offer takes into account that Alice faces increasing inflation pressure (now at 27.1% if we go to the next round), while I face none. Since Alice's money loses value with each passing round, it's becoming increasingly beneficial for her to accept a deal sooner rather than later. This offer gives her a substantial portion while acknowledging the game's built-in asymmetry."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

- Alice is now offering me exactly half of the total: $500,000
- This is a $30,000 increase from her previous offer
- Alice's money has already lost 34.39% of its value due to inflation
- If I reject again, her next round's money will be worth 41% less than the original value
- I face no inflation penalty

Alice's offer has continued to improve and has now reached an even 50-50 split. This is a significant improvement from her initial offers. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, we're now approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds, and there's increasing risk if we don't reach an agreement.

Given the fair 50-50 split, Alice's significant inflation disadvantage, and the need to conclude negotiations within our limited rounds, I'll accept this offer.
