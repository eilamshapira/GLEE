"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a fair offer considering we both face inflation, though mine is higher at 10% per round versus Bob's 5%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 530000, ""bob_gain"": 470000}

I propose a division where I receive $530,000 and Bob receives $470,000. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% per round vs Bob's 5%), this adjusted split acknowledges both our need to conclude quickly while still being fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose a division where I receive $520,000 and Bob receives $480,000. Since we're now in round 5, inflation is significantly affecting both of us, especially me with my higher 10% rate. This offer is more balanced and acknowledges the increasing pressure to reach an agreement."
