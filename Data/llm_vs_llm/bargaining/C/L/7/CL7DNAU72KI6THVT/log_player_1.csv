"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'd like a larger share. This 55-45 split seems fair, given I'm making a reasonable counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $40.5 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- To beat the current $40.5 effective value, I'd need to secure at least $50.63 in the next round ($50.63 * 0.8 = $40.5)
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation losses

Given these factors, I should accept. The offer is reasonable considering inflation, and the risk of further devaluation is too high.
