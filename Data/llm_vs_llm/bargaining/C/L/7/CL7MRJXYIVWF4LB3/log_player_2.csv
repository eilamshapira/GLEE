"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the fairness of the offer and the impact of inflation on future rounds.

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is equal on its face. However, I should consider that if I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means if I make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 will effectively be worth only $80 to me.

Given this inflation penalty, a fair first-round offer is actually reasonable to accept. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than 50% just to break even compared to accepting now.
