"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to account for the 5% inflation on my side. The initial value of $10,000 for me is now worth $9500.

The offer is: Alice gets $4000, Bob gets $6000.

To calculate my effective gain considering inflation:

*   My perspective: I'm getting $4000.
*   Original value of 4000 in the first round: $4000 * 1.00 = $4000
*   Current value of 4000 considering inflation: $4000 * 0.95 = $3800

Since I started with 10,000 in the first round, my gain is $3800 which is less than half of the money I can get initially.

Therefore, I will reject.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I need to consider inflation again. The initial value of $10,000 for me is now worth $9025 ($10000 * 0.95 * 0.95).

Given the diminishing value of the money for me, I need to be more aggressive. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer, taking into account the accumulated inflation. The money for me is worth 14.26% less than in round 1.

Here's the breakdown:

*   Alice's offered gain: $3500
*   Considering the inflation impact: $10000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $8574
*   Alice's gain in terms of round 1 value: $3500
*   Alice's gain in terms of current value: $3500 * 0.8574 = $2999
*   Bob's gain: $6500

Given this is a relatively low amount, I will reject and aim for a higher outcome.
