"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing $10,000 between Bob and me. Since there's inflation affecting Bob's value of money (20% less each round), I should consider that in my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both significant value right away, without risking devaluation through multiple rounds of negotiation."
