"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly. I'm offering you $45 now. This is a good deal for both of us considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the total amount will be worth 20% less ($80)
   - I could potentially get more, but we'd both lose value

While a 45-55 split isn't perfectly equal, it's reasonably fair, and accepting now means we avoid the 20% inflation penalty. If I reject and make a counter-offer, we'd be negotiating over a smaller total amount, which isn't in either of our interests.
