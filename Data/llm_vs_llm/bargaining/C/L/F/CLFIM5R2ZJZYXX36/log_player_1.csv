"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, 55/45 is fair! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more, I'll think carefully. Considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, his $5500 is actually worth $4950 (10% less). This changes the dynamics.

My decision:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, and considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Remember, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less in each round. So, in this round, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 + 10% less in Round 2).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split favors both, but you're losing value fast!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is biting, need a better split! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer gives him $5800, but due to the cumulative inflation (10% in Round 1, 10% in Round 2, and 10% in Round 3, which results in a total of 27.1% less value), his $5800 is actually worth actually $4232 (since 5800 * (1 - 0.271) = 4232).

Considering this, my $4200 is worth the same, $4200, since inflation doesn't affect my gain.

My decision:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
