"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 45, but its value is reduced by 36% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is approximately 45 * 0.64 = 28.8.

Given this, I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing, and it's worth 36% less for me, but only 9.75% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to make an offer that is more favorable to me.
