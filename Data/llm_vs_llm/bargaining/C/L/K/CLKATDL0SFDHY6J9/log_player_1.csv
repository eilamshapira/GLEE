"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly and avoid inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount and can avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. I know that Bob's money is worth 5% less this round due to inflation
3. For me, the value is still the same as round 1
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. $500,000 for me now is better than risking further rounds

This is actually a decent offer. While I tried to get more in my first offer, a guaranteed $500,000 with no inflation impact on my side is reasonable. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds.
