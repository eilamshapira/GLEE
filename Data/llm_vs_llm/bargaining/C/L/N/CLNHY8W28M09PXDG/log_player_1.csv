"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split would be more fair, considering the inflation rate. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. Let's settle for $5000 each. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
