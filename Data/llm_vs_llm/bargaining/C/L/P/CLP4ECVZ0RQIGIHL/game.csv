5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, for Round 1 I'd like to propose an even split of $10000â€”$5000 for each of us. Given that waiting further will cost me due to a 5% inflation drop per round, I believe finalizing the deal now benefits both of us. Let's settle quickly for a fair and immediate agreement!",Alice,1,
