"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a better offer in the next round. Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round, she should be more willing to accept a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is much fairer than Alice's initial offer, and considering that Alice faces 10% depreciation per round, she should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll counter in the next round. Alice's position is weakening due to the increasing inflation penalty she faces (it will be 29% next round), while I'm not affected by inflation. I can propose a better split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. Given that Alice now faces a 29% depreciation on her share and the depreciation will continue to increase by 10% each round, she should seriously consider accepting this offer. If she waits longer, not only will she likely face worse offers, but her share will be worth even less due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer. While this 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, Alice's position continues to weaken due to inflation (it will be about 44% next round). Since I'm not affected by inflation and we still have several rounds left, I can negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. At this point, Alice's share is being heavily impacted by inflation (44% loss in value for her next round), while my share maintains its full value. The rational choice for Alice would be to accept this offer, as waiting longer will likely result in both a smaller share and more value lost to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll continue negotiating. Alice is now losing almost 47% of her share's value to inflation, and this will increase to around 57% next round. Since I'm still completely protected from inflation and we have 5 rounds remaining, I can push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose an 80-20 split in my favor. Alice is now facing about 57% depreciation on her share in the next round, while my share remains unaffected by inflation. With only 4 rounds remaining and her share continuing to lose substantial value each round, accepting this offer would be better than waiting for an even worse situation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's offer is getting better, I'll continue negotiating. Alice is now losing about 57% of her share's value to inflation, and this will increase to around 67% next round. With 3 rounds remaining and my position still completely protected from inflation, I can push for an even more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

I propose an 85-15 split in my favor. At this point, Alice's share will lose about 67% of its value next round due to inflation, while my share remains unaffected. With only 2 rounds remaining after this one, and her share continuing to rapidly depreciate, accepting this offer would be better than risking an even smaller share or potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
