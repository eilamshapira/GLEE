"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is far too uneven - a 90/10 split heavily favoring Alice isn't fair. I'll make a more equitable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split, which would be fair to both parties. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risk further devaluation through more rounds of negotiation."
