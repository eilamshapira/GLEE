"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is seemingly fair
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, so the $50 would become $47.50 for me
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value due to inflation makes this a reasonable offer
4. This is the first round, and Alice opened with a fair split
