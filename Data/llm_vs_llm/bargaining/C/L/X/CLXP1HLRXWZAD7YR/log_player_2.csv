"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a fair offer, as it gives me a slight advantage but still provides Alice with a substantial amount. It's more equitable than her initial offer, and shows I'm willing to be reasonable while still looking out for my interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a perfectly fair 50-50 split of the $10,000, which is generally considered the most equitable solution. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to worse outcomes, and we only have 9 rounds left. This is a rational and fair offer that I should accept.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
