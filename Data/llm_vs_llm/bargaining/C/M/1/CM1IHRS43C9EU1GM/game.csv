5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This way we both walk away with an equal share.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split. Considering your 5% decrease each round, this is fairer as the rounds progress.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I'm proposing a 52-48 split which is actually more fair when accounting for my 5% inflation penalty. If we keep rejecting offers, I lose more with each round due to inflation, and eventually we may both get nothing. This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for the asymmetric inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,Let's try a 58-42 split. This accounts for your inflation penalty and gives us both a fair chance to walk away with a rewarding amount.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, we're already in round 5, and my portion has lost 19% value due to inflation. If we continue this pattern of rejections, we both risk walking away with nothing. A 53-47 split is fair considering the cumulative inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree now rather than lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4300.0,5700.0,How about a 57-43 split this time? I believe this offer fairly compensates for your inflation penalty and allows us to conclude with a decent share for both.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7 with my portion having lost over 26% value due to inflation. We have only 5 rounds left before we both get nothing. I'm proposing a 55-45 split which, when accounting for my inflation penalty, is actually less valuable to me than a 50-50 split would have been in round 1. This is more than fair - please accept so we can both benefit.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's agree on a 55-45 split in my favor instead. This still offers a good recovery for the inflation impact on your end and allows us both to secure a reasonable portion before the rounds run out.,Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're running out of time with only 3 rounds left after this. My portion has already lost 34% value due to inflation. I'm now offering a 51-49 split in your favor, which is extremely generous considering the inflation penalty. If we don't agree soon, we're both going to walk away with nothing. This is a very fair offer that benefits us both.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Let's go for a 54-46 split. It compensates for your inflation impact and allows us both to leave with a fair amount as the game winds down. Time is running short, so accepting now ensures we don't walk away with nothing.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,accept
