"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This way we both walk away with an equal share.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 52-48 split which is actually more fair when accounting for my 5% inflation penalty. If we keep rejecting offers, I lose more with each round due to inflation, and eventually we may both get nothing. This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for the asymmetric inflation.

A 53-47 split is fair considering the cumulative inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree now rather than lose more value.
