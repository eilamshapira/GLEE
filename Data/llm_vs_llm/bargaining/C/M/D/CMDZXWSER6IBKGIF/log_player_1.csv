Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a loss. It's a win-win situation. If we wait for later, you will lose because of inflation.

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
