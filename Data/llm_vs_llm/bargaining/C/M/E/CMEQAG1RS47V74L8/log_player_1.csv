**Reasoning:**

This round, Bob would be acutely aware that he'll be getting a worse deal if I reject his offer and he's forced to accept mine in round 4 (due to the 10% inflation).  My offer is slightly better than what he offered me, and significantly better than what he'd be left with if he declines. This puts the pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me $40 (worth $27.90 of the original value). If I reject Bob's offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and there's no guarantee he'll offer me a better deal. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse one later."
