"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the entire $100 would be worth $90 to me).

If I accept now, I get $40.
If I reject and go to next round, the maximum I could get would be worth less due to inflation. Even if I proposed taking all $100, it would only be worth $90 to me.

Since $40 now is better than a maximum of $90 * any split in the next round (with the risk of Alice rejecting), I should accept this offer.
