"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 evenly—$500K for you and $500K for me. I believe settling now is best since delay hurts my share due to inflation. Let’s agree now and both secure our gains!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Since you mentioned inflation affects you, I'm willing to take a larger share. Let's divide it 60-40, and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
