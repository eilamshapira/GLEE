525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, time is running out, and the money is losing value for me. Let's meet in the middle from your previous offer. I'll take $525000 and you take $475000. This is a fair compromise. Please accept!",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation is squeezing your share of the value, and we both want to secure a fair deal quickly. In light of our previous offers, I'd like to propose a new division: I'll take $520000 and you'll receive $480000. This adjusts our prior positions to help you recover a bit more, even as inflation reduces the effective value of cash for you. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance given our circumstances. I look forward to your timely reply so we can both avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
