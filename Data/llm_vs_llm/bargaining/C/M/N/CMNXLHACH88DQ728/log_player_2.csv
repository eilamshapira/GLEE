# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the money is losing value for me. Let's meet in the middle from your previous offer. I'll take $525000 and you take $475000. This is a fair compromise. Please accept!

In light of our previous offers, I'd like to propose a new division: I'll take $520,000 and you'll receive $480,000. This adjusts our prior positions to help you recover a bit more, even as inflation reduces the effective value of cash for you. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance given our circumstances. I look forward to your timely reply so we can both avoid further losses.""}"
