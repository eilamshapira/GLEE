4500.0,5500.0,"Hello Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. I'm proposing a slight adjustment given that inflation affects me at 5% per round. This 55/45 split helps offset some of that pressure while still giving you a substantial portion. We can conclude quickly and both walk away with good value before inflation erodes our gains.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose a 48/52 split. This way, you get a bit more to account for your 5% inflation, while I still get a fair share despite my higher inflation rate. Let's settle this round to minimize further loss in value.",Alice,3,
