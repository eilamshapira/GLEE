"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. I'm proposing a slight adjustment given that inflation affects me at 5% per round. This 55/45 split helps offset some of that pressure while still giving you a substantial portion. We can conclude quickly and both walk away with good value before inflation erodes our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose a 48/52 split. This way, you get a bit more to account for your 5% inflation, while I still get a fair share despite my higher inflation rate. Let's settle this round to minimize further loss in value.""
