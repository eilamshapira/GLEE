"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. This is a fair offer on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. However, I would then have the opportunity to propose a division that gives me more than $5,000.

Given that we're only in the first round and have many rounds remaining, I think I can try for a slightly better deal, especially since inflation affects me specifically.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. I'm proposing a slight adjustment given that inflation affects me at 5% per round. This 55/45 split helps offset some of that pressure while still giving you a substantial portion. We can conclude quickly and both walk away with good value before inflation erodes our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose a 48/52 split. This way, you get a bit more to account for your 5% inflation, while I still get a fair share despite my higher inflation rate. Let's settle this round to minimize further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $5,200, which is more than the initial even split. She's revealed that inflation affects her more significantly (36% by round 3) than it affects me (9.75% by round 3).

This is a generous offer considering:
1. I'm getting more than half of the total amount
2. If I reject, I'll face additional 5% inflation in the next round
3. Alice seems to be facing much higher inflation (possibly 12% per round)
4. We're already in round 3, so continuing to negotiate means both of us lose value

Given that Alice is facing much steeper inflation than I am and is still offering me a majority share, this seems like a fair deal. Taking it now secures a good value before further rounds diminish our potential gains.
