60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something. Deal?",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation affecting my gains, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. A 65-35 split would give me approximately $52 in round 1 value, which is more reasonable. Please consider accepting to avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's settle for a 60-40 split in my favor this time, considering the inflation hasn't affected me yet. This way, we both get something reasonable.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting my gains, this 75-25 split would give me about $38.40 in round 1 value, while you still get $25 at full value. If we don't agree soon, we risk getting nothing in 7 rounds. This is a reasonable compromise given the inflation impact.",Alice,5,
