"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 20% inflation, my $50 is only worth $40 in round 1 terms. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation affecting my gains, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. A 65-35 split would give me approximately $52 in round 1 value, which is more reasonable. Please consider accepting to avoid further inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's settle for a 60-40 split in my favor this time, considering the inflation hasn't affected me yet. This way, we both get something reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 48.8% inflation, my $40 would only be worth about $20.48 in round 1 terms. Even considering the risk of further inflation, I can still try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting my gains, this 75-25 split would give me about $38.40 in round 1 value, while you still get $25 at full value. If we don't agree soon, we risk getting nothing in 7 rounds. This is a reasonable compromise given the inflation impact.""}"
