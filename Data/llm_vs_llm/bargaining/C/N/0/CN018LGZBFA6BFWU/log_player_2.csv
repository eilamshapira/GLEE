Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both walk away with something. Deal?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation affecting my gains, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. A 65-35 split would give me approximately $52 in round 1 value, which is more reasonable. Please consider accepting to avoid further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

However, I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's settle for a 60-40 split in my favor this time, considering the inflation hasn't affected me yet. This way, we both get something reasonable.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting my gains, this 75-25 split would give me about $38.40 in round 1 value, while you still get $25 at full value. If we don't agree soon, we risk getting nothing in 7 rounds. This is a reasonable compromise given the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75
