"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 10% per round inflation penalty I face. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a split that's favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me 60% of the money and Bob 40%. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the money will be worth 10% less to me, so I'd only get 90% of whatever amount we agree upon. This gives Bob some incentive to accept now rather than make a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $405,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less (20% total)
- Bob's position is getting stronger due to the inflation affecting only me

While this offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal, given the inflation penalty I'm facing, this is still a decent offer. If I reject, I'll be at an even bigger disadvantage in the next round. It's better to accept now than risk getting an even worse deal later.
