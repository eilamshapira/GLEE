"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money 60/40. This is a generous offer, and the effects of inflation could hurt us both if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$, while taking 6000$ for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total pot is effectively worth 9000$ from my perspective.

While Alice's split isn't completely even, it's not terribly unfair. If I reject, I could potentially negotiate a better deal, but:
1. The 10% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more just to break even
2. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a counter-offer
3. Further rounds would continue eroding the money's value for me

Given these factors, while the split isn't perfect, it's better to accept now than risk losing value to inflation.
