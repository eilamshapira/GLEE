"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you take the full $1000000 right now. Given our alternating-offer structure and the fact that you will have the advantage as the final proposer if we wait until the 12th round, I believe accepting this immediate offer is in your best interest. Let's settle quickly and avoid any delay! 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0
