"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since you lose more value than me with each round, so it's in your interest to accept now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I lose more value each round. I'm willing to give you a smaller share to end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
# Let me counter-offer since Bob loses more value each round due to higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm offering a slightly better split for you than my first offer. Due to your 20% inflation rate, this is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. Let's conclude this reasonably.""}"
