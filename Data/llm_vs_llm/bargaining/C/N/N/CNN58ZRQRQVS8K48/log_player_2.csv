Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a slightly better split for you than my first offer. Due to your 20% inflation rate, this is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round. Let's conclude this reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
