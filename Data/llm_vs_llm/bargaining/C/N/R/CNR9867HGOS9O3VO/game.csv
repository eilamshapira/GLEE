35.0,65.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this split is more reasonable.",Bob,4,

70.0,30.0,I'm now facing almost 60% inflation in the next round. This offer gives us both approximately equal value when accounting for inflation. Let's finish this now before we both lose more value.,Alice,5,
