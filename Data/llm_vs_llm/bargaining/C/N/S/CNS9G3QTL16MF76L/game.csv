60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is fair because if we wait, both of us lose value, but I lose more. Let's settle this now so we both walk away with good value.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more since you're more eager to settle. However, I'm still open to negotiations and willing to compromise.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a more moderate 55-45 split. Due to the higher inflation rate on my end (10% vs your 5%), delaying further rounds significantly hurts me more than you. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions - let's settle now before we both lose more value to inflation.",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe you're more motivated to settle. Given the decreasing value, I'm willing to take a bit more. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually acceptable agreement.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money is already worth 34.39% less to me and 18.55% less to you than when we started. My proposed 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions while recognizing that further delays hurt us both substantially. Given the inflation difference, this is a fair compromise - let's end this now before we both lose even more value.",Alice,5,
