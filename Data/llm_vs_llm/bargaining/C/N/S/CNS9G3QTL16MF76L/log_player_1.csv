"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that accounts for the inflation difference between us.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is fair because if we wait, both of us lose value, but I lose more. Let's settle this now so we both walk away with good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a more moderate 55-45 split. Due to the higher inflation rate on my end (10% vs your 5%), delaying further rounds significantly hurts me more than you. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions - let's settle now before we both lose more value to inflation.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe you're more motivated to settle. Given the decreasing value, I'm willing to take a bit more. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually acceptable agreement.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money is already worth 34.39% less to me and 18.55% less to you than when we started. My proposed 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions while recognizing that further delays hurt us both substantially. Given the inflation difference, this is a fair compromise - let's end this now before we both lose even more value.""}"
