"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is fair because if we wait, both of us lose value, but I lose more. Let's settle this now so we both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more since you're more eager to settle. However, I'm still open to negotiations and willing to compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a more moderate 55-45 split. Due to the higher inflation rate on my end (10% vs your 5%), delaying further rounds significantly hurts me more than you. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions - let's settle now before we both lose more value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, 
""alice_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe you're more motivated to settle. Given the decreasing value, I'm willing to take a bit more. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually acceptable agreement.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding our potential gains. The money is already worth 34.39% less to me and 18.55% less to you than when we started. My proposed 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions while recognizing that further delays hurt us both substantially. Given the inflation difference, this is a fair compromise - let's end this now before we both lose even more value. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
