"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this quickly! I'll take 90% and you get 10%. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this highly unfair offer. As Bob, I deserve a more equitable share of the money. While I need to be mindful of the 5% inflation per round, a 90-10 split is too extreme. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this 50-50. This way we both win, and we avoid losing value to inflation. It's the most equitable solution.""}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split since both of us deserve an equal share. While I could try to negotiate for more, a fair split is likely to be accepted and helps us avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would hurt my earnings if we continue negotiating for multiple rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's adjust. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Still a good deal, considering inflation is eating away at the value! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer to accept because:
1. The split (60-40) is much fairer than the initial 90-10 proposal
2. With inflation reducing my gains by 9.75%, further negotiations could end up costing more than what I might gain
3. $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of losing more value to inflation or potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds makes this an acceptable compromise
4. Interestingly, Alice seems to be affected more by inflation (19% vs my 9.75%), which might explain why she's become more reasonable in her offer

Better to secure this deal now than risk further depreciation of the money's value."
