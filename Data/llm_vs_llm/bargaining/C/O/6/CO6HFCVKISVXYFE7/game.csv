6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value much faster (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. This split is more equitable given those constraints, and I'm happy to accept a deal now rather than letting inflation diminish our total value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates. This offer still accounts for that while being a bit more balanced.  Let's not risk letting the total amount shrink further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. However, given our different inflation rates (your 20% vs my 5%), your incentive to reach an agreement quickly is much stronger. This 60/40 split acknowledges that reality. Remember that with each passing round, your potential gain loses substantially more value than mine. Let's finalize this now so we both walk away with more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's just agree on this and avoid losing even more money to inflation.",Alice,5,
