Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value much faster (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. This split is more equitable given those constraints, and I'm happy to accept a deal now rather than letting inflation diminish our total value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. However, given our different inflation rates (your 20% vs my 5%), your incentive to reach an agreement quickly is much stronger. This 60/40 split acknowledges that reality. Remember that with each passing round, your potential gain loses substantially more value than mine. Let's finalize this now so we both walk away with more value.

# Bob gain: 6000
