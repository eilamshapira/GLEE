"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice proposes that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

Given the inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Alice per round), this means:
- If I reject and we reach the next round, my $4,000 becomes worth $3,800 (5% less)
- For Alice, her $6,000 becomes worth only $4,800 (20% less)

This significant difference in inflation rates gives me an advantage in later rounds. Also, since I'll make the next offer if I reject, I can propose a more favorable split.

The initial offer of 40/60 seems tilted in Alice's favor, especially considering our different inflation pressures.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates and suggests a more balanced approach.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value much faster (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. This split is more equitable given those constraints, and I'm happy to accept a deal now rather than letting inflation diminish our total value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates. This offer still accounts for that while being a bit more balanced.  Let's not risk letting the total amount shrink further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this improved offer from Alice.

Alice has moved from a 40/60 split to a 45/55 split in my favor. Let's consider our positions:

- Current inflation impact: My money is worth 9.75% less than round 1, while Alice's is worth 36% less
- If we continue to round 4, my inflation will be ~15% and Alice's will be ~49%
- Alice clearly has a stronger incentive to settle sooner due to her much higher inflation rate
- I'll have the advantage of making the next offer if I reject

However, Alice has made a meaningful concession. The $4,500 I'd get now is better than the $4,000 initially offered, and we're moving in the right direction.

Given that we still have several rounds left and the increasing pressure on Alice due to the 20% inflation rate per round, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. However, given our different inflation rates (your 20% vs my 5%), your incentive to reach an agreement quickly is much stronger. This 60/40 split acknowledges that reality. Remember that with each passing round, your potential gain loses substantially more value than mine. Let's finalize this now so we both walk away with more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's just agree on this and avoid losing even more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this 50/50 split offer.

The inflation impacts are now significant:
- My potential money is worth 18.55% less than at the start
- Alice's potential money is worth 59.04% less than at the start

If we go another round:
- My inflation will increase to about 23.5%
- Alice's inflation will reach about 67%

Alice has moved from 40/60 to 45/55 and now to 50/50, showing increasing willingness to compromise. This even split seems reasonable given:

1. We're already 5 rounds in, and inflation is reducing the total value significantly
2. Alice's high inflation rate means she's strongly motivated to settle
3. We're converging toward a fair division
4. There's risk in continuing to push too hard

A 50/50 split is traditionally considered fair, and with the inflation dynamics, this seems like a good point to accept.
