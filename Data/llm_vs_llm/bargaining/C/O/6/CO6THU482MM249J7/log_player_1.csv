Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm aiming for a slightly more aggressive split this round, considering the inflation. Bob's offer in round 2 suggests he might be willing to accept a larger share for himself than my initial offer, but I still want to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although this is the same offer Bob gave in round 2, the value has decreased significantly due to inflation. Accepting now is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round."
