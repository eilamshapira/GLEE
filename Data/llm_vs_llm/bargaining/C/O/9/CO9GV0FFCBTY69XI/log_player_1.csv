"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's be fair about this. I'm proposing a roughly even split with a bit more for me since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a good deal for both of us right from the start.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be fair, but I think your initial offer was slightly biased. Considering the inflation rate affecting me is higher, I've adjusted the split to be more even while still acknowledging your inflation concerns. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
