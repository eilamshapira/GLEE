"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's be fair about this. I'm proposing a roughly even split with a bit more for me since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a good deal for both of us right from the start. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
