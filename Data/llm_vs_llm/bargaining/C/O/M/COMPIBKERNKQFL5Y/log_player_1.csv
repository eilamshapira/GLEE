"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% depreciation per round for me. Since Bob doesn't face depreciation, he might be motivated to wait, but I'll offer him a substantial portion to make accepting now attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects it, my next potential gain would be worth 20% less in the next round. By offering Bob a significant portion ($400,000), I hope to incentivize him to accept now rather than moving to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer, I get $400,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $320,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any money I get will be worth another 20% less (so only 64% of original value)
3. Bob might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and worse inflation for me

Given that the value of money is rapidly decreasing for me but not for Bob, and that I'm already in round 2 with 20% inflation, I should accept this offer. Continuing the game would likely lead to worse outcomes for me due to the asymmetric inflation effect.
