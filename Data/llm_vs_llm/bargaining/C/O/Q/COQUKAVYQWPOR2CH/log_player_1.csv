"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), I should make a somewhat favorable offer to encourage acceptance, but still maintain an advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining my advantage. If Bob declines, their counter-offer will be worth less to them due to the 20% inflation penalty."
