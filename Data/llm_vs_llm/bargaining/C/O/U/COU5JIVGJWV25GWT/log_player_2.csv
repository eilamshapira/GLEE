"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means I'd get 40% of the total amount. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so the $100 pot would effectively be worth $80 from my perspective.

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair,"" I need to consider that:
1. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me
2. Even with the current 40-60 split, I'd get $40 which is better than risking further rounds with diminishing value
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she might be more willing to wait

Given these factors, accepting $40 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds.
