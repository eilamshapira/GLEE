"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split since this is the first round, but keeping a bit more for myself since I have the first-mover advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. For me (Alice), I would get $5,000 at full value
2. For Bob, he would get $5,000, but it's worth 10% less to him due to inflation
3. This offer is slightly worse for me than my initial proposal ($5,500)
4. If I reject, we go to another round, but I'm not sure how much more inflation will affect Bob's utility
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - this is a reasonable offer
