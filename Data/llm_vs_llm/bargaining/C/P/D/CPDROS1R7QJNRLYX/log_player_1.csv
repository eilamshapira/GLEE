"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you decline, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 55-45 split is fairer. The money is depreciating faster for you. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject because even though the money is worth 20% less to me now, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. A 45% share that's worth 20% less than original value is too low, considering I still have several rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a reasonable 45-55 split. With 20% inflation affecting my share each round, this is fair. If we keep negotiating, both of us risk losing value. Let's agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the rounds are ticking by. My offer: 57.5% for me, 42.5% for you. This reflects the increasing inflation on your side. Let's lock this in. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept because with the 48.8% inflation affecting my share, further negotiations would significantly reduce my effective gains. The 425,000 with 48.8% inflation gives me approximately 217,600 in original value terms. If I wait longer, the inflation will make any future gains worth even less, and Bob knows this. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
