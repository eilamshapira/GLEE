"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfair. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that better reflects a fair division of the money, considering the different inflation rates we face."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs 10%) in each round. This is a fair offer that takes into account our different time preferences while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this 50-50 split. While I face higher inflation (36% vs 19%), this is still a reasonable offer. If I reject, my future gains will be worth even less due to the higher inflation rate I face, and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal in later rounds. 5000$ now (even with 36% inflation) is better than risking further depreciation of my share."
