"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I want to propose a fair split of the $100, while also considering the inflation effect that will reduce the value of any future division for me. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Since I know that inflation will reduce the value of money for me in future rounds, this is the most efficient solution. We both walk away with half the money right now.""}"
