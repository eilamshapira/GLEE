"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

$400,000 is a substantial amount, but it's less than half of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
2. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. After 12 rounds, we both get nothing

If I reject, my $400,000 becomes worth $360,000 next round. To make it worthwhile to reject, I'd need to be confident I can get significantly more than $400,000 and have Alice accept.

Given the risk of further inflation and potential rejection, I'll accept this offer.
