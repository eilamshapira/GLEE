"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (so the $100 becomes effectively worth $80 to me). Even if I were to get a larger share in the next round, I need to consider if it would outweigh this loss in value.

A 50-50 split gives me $50 now, which is better than potentially getting even 60% of the inflated value in the next round ($60 of $80 = $48). Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I can't predict her behavior with certainty, but this first offer is already fair and declining it puts me at a disadvantage.
