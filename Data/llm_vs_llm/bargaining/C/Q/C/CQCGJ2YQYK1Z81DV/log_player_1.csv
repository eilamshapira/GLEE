"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 55-45 split with me receiving $55 and you $45. Since my share loses 5% in value each round, settling now benefits us both. Let's agree quickly and avoid any unnecessary loss!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a fair 50-50 split seems reasonable. Since my share doesn't lose value over time, I'm in no rush. How about we settle on an equal split? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
