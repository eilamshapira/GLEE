"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my thought process:

*   **Current Situation:** Alice is offering me $40, and keeping $60 for herself.

*   **Inflation:** While I don't know Alice's inflation rate, my money loses 5% of its value each round.

*   **Round Consideration:** Accepting now guarantees me $40. If I reject, I risk getting less than $40 in future rounds due to my own inflation, and the possibility that Alice's demands increase.

*   **Strategic Decision:** Since this is the first round, rejecting risks a lower payout later due to inflation. $40 is a reasonable starting point, given the constraints.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.
