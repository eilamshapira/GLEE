55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because each round costs me 20% in inflation. If we agree now, we both walk away with substantial amounts rather than losing value by prolonging negotiations.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I rejected your offer because I believe a 50/50 split is more fair, considering we both have the same goal. However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses from inflation.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but a 40/60 split is too much in your favor. I'm offering a perfectly fair 50/50 split now. Remember that I'm losing 20% value each round, so this 50 is already worth less to me than in round 1. Let's agree on this equal division and both walk away satisfied.",Alice,3,
