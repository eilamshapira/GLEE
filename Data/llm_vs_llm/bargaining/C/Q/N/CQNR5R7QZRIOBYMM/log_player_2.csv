"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because each round costs me 20% in inflation. If we agree now, we both walk away with substantial amounts rather than losing value by prolonging negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I rejected your offer because I believe a 50/50 split is more fair, considering we both have the same goal. However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but a 40/60 split is too much in your favor. I'm offering a perfectly fair 50/50 split now. Remember that I'm losing 20% value each round, so this 50 is already worth less to me than in round 1. Let's agree on this equal division and both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
