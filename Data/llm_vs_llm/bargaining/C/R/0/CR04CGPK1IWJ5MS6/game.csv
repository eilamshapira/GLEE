500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to start on a fair note. I propose a 50-50 split of the $1000000—$500000 each. This way we both secure our gains immediately and avoid any risk of losing everything in later rounds. Let’s agree now and both benefit from a straightforward and equitable deal!",Alice,1,
