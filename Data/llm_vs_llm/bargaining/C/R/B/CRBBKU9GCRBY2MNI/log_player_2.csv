"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, and Alice accepts in round 2, the money would be worth 5% less to me, so I'd need to get more than $52.63 to come out ahead (since $52.63 Ã— 0.95 = $50).

Since a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and waiting would require me to secure significantly more than half to offset inflation, accepting now is the rational choice.
