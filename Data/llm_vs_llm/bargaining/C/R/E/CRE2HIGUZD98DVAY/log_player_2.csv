"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end the game here and get paid! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair and whether I should accept it or make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while keeping $60 for herself. That's not an equal split, and I would have the opportunity to make my own proposal in the next round if I reject this offer.

Given that I could propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while trying to be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think an even 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. We both walk away with the same amount.""}"
