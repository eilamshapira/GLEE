"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Given that the money devalues by 20% each round for Alice, but maintains its value for me, I have an advantage in negotiation. If I reject this offer:
* I can make a counter-offer next round
* For Alice, the total $1M will only be worth $800K in the next round
* This means she would likely accept a smaller portion to avoid further devaluation

The current offer gives me $400K, which is less than half. I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer, taking advantage of the time pressure on Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 20% devaluation per round while I don't, I can make a more aggressive offer. If she rejects this, her share would be worth even less in the next round. From her perspective, $500K now is better than $600K in the next round (which would only be worth $480K to her due to 20% devaluation).

I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This gives me a better deal than her initial offer, but still leaves Alice with enough that she should rationally accept rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. For Alice, her $500K is actually only worth $320K (due to 36% devaluation)
2. My $500K maintains its full value
3. If I reject:
   * We go to round 4
   * Alice's money will devalue by another 20%
   * I can make another offer when Alice's position is even weaker

The offer is better than her first offer, but given my strong negotiating position (no devaluation for me), I can likely get an even better deal by rejecting.

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the devaluation, moving from her initial 60/40 split to a 50/50 split. In the next round, she'll be under even more pressure to accept a less favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now significantly devalued (and will devalue further if she rejects), I can make an even more aggressive offer. For Alice, any further delays will severely impact the value she receives.

At this point, if Alice rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth about 50% less than the original value. This gives me significant leverage.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This might seem aggressive, but from Alice's perspective:
1. If she accepts, she gets $300K (though devalued)
2. If she rejects and we continue to the next round, even a larger nominal amount would be worth less to her due to the compounding devaluation
3. She's already shown willingness to compromise by moving from 60/40 to 50/50

This offer is rational given the game's mechanics and should be more attractive to Alice than continuing to later rounds."
