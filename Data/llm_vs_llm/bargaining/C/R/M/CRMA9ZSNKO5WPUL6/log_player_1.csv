"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but since the money doesn't lose value for me, I deserve a larger share. This is still a good deal for you - if you reject, your next round's money will be worth 5% less. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
