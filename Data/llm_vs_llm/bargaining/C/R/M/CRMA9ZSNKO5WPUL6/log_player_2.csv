"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I get a bit more upfront since the value of the money decreases for me each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is asking for $5,500, leaving me with $4,500.

Her argument about the money being worth less to her each round (5% less) is valid. However, I believe I can get a better deal since:
1. The money doesn't lose value for me at all
2. By rejecting, I'll get to make the next proposal
3. Alice will have more pressure to accept my next offer since her money will be worth 5% less

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for Alice's time pressure while still being favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, but since the money doesn't lose value for me, I deserve a larger share. This is still a good deal for you - if you reject, your next round's money will be worth 5% less.""}"
