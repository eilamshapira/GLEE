"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'll make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation for each round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm starting with a slightly favorable split, but I want to increase the chances of Bob accepting it in this first round to avoid the inflation penalty. I'm proposing Alice gets $6000 and Bob gets $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer, and now inflation is kicking in.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer for me: $4500 * (1 - 0.10) = $4050

Now, let's consider what I could potentially gain if I reject. I would need to make an offer to Bob in the next round. If I propose a split where I get, say, $6000, it would be worth even less due to further inflation.

Compared to my initial offer, Bob is now proposing I get 45% of the total, compared to my proposal where I'd get 60%.

Given the inflation and the risk of further reductions in value if I reject, I will accept this offer.
