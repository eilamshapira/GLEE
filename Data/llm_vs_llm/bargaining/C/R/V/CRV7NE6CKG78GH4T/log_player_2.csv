"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale: This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1 out of $1,000,000. Even with the 10% inflation risk per round, I have better chances of getting a fairer deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. I can afford to reject this and make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Rationale: I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer because:
1. It gives Alice a substantial portion ($400,000)
2. It's not too greedy, which increases the chances of acceptance
3. With 10% inflation per round for me, I need to secure a good amount early
4. It's much fairer than Alice's initial lowball offer

The proposal shows I'm willing to be reasonable while still ensuring I get a good outcome. If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating, but the inflation penalty means we both have incentives to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale: Even with 19% inflation reducing my purchasing power, $100,000 is still too low of an offer when dealing with $1M total. My $100,000 would actually be worth about $81,000 due to inflation, while Alice keeps $900,000 at full value. This is still very unfair.

While I need to be mindful of the increasing inflation (and that it only affects my portion), I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice has shown some movement from her initial $1 offer to $100,000, which suggests room for further negotiation. I'll make a more moderate counter-offer in the next round to try to reach a fair agreement before inflation erodes too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Rationale: I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Alice while still ensuring I get a reasonable share:

1. I've reduced my ask from the previous 600k to 550k, showing willingness to compromise
2. The 55-45 split is more balanced than my previous offer
3. With inflation already at 19% and growing, we both have strong incentives to reach an agreement soon
4. This is still much fairer than Alice's 90-10 split offer
5. If Alice rejects this, I can still make further concessions in future rounds, but I'm maintaining a strong negotiating position

The offer demonstrates continued good faith while protecting my interests against the mounting inflation pressure. It gives Alice a very substantial sum while ensuring I still get enough to make the deal worthwhile despite the inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale: While Alice is gradually increasing her offers ($1 -> $100k -> $150k), and my inflation penalty is getting significant (34.39% reduction), this offer is still too unbalanced:

- My $150,000 would actually be worth about $98,415 after inflation
- Alice keeps $850,000 at full value
- This is still approximately an 89-11 split in Alice's favor

Even with the mounting inflation pressure, this offer is too low. Alice's pattern of gradually increasing offers suggests there's still room for negotiation. We're only in round 5 of 12, so while I need to be increasingly cautious about inflation, there's still time to reach a more balanced agreement. I'll make a more moderate counter-offer in the next round to try to accelerate reaching a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Rationale: I'm making a significant concession with a perfectly even 50-50 split:

1. Moving from my previous 55-45 split to 50-50 shows substantial willingness to compromise
2. A 50-50 split appeals to fundamental fairness and is harder to reject on principle
3. With inflation now at 34.39% and rising, I need to push for an agreement soon
4. This is still much better for me than Alice's 85-15 split offer
5. Even with the inflation penalty, my $500k (worth about $328k after inflation) is significantly better than Alice's last offer

This even split represents a fair middle ground and should signal to Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement before inflation erodes too much value. If Alice rejects this fundamentally fair offer, it suggests she's trying to exploit the inflation pressure, in which case I'll need to consider larger concessions in future rounds."
