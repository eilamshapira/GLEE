"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm playing as Alice in this game, I'll start with the first proposal. Understanding that inflation affects Bob's valuation (the money is worth 5% less to him each round), but doesn't affect mine, I'll make a reasonable initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is a fair split that acknowledges we both deserve a substantial portion, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider that with each round, Bob's money loses 5% value to him. Since we're now in round 3, another rejection would put us in round 4, where Bob's money would be worth about 15% less than original value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose a more balanced split where I receive $525,000 and Bob receives $475,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer that acknowledges Bob's counter, while still securing a fair share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
