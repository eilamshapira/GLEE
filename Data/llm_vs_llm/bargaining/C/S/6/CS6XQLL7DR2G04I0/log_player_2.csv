"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While I could get $40, I should consider that even with inflation reducing the value by 10% next round, I can potentially make a better offer. A 50-50 split would be more fair, and even with inflation, I could offer something that nets me more than $40.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the 10% inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to offer you $45, Alice, while I take $55. This is a fair offer considering I've already lost 10% value due to inflation after rejecting your first offer. This split gives us both a reasonable portion and allows us to conclude the negotiation now rather than continuing with further rounds where the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $43, but the inflation means my money is worth 19% less than in round 1. 

If I reject and go to round 4, the inflation will increase to 27.1% for me (compounding 10% three times), and I'd need to make a new offer. 

$43 with 19% inflation is equivalent to about $34.83 in original value, which is less than the $40 originally offered. Also, Alice clearly isn't facing inflation pressure, so she has less incentive to settle quickly.

Given this information, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
