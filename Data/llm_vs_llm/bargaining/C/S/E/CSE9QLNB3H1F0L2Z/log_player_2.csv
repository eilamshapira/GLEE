"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4000 out of the $10,000, which is less than half. If I reject this, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. Let me consider if making a counter-offer is beneficial.

If I reject, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%, making the $10,000 effectively worth $9,500 to me. I could then propose a more favorable split, but need to weigh that against the lost value.

Since Alice's current offer gives me $4,000, and inflation would reduce the total value to $9,500 in the next round, I should reject if I believe I can secure more than $4,000 even after the 5% inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my counter-offer now. Since we're already in round 2, I need to account for the 5% inflation that's affecting me. I want to offer a fair split that Alice would likely accept, as rejecting would lead to further rounds with more inflation for me.
