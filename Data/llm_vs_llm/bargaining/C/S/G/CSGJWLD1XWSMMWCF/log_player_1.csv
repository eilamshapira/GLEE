"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the inflation effect on my gains, so I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob would accept to avoid losing value in future rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I initiated the proposal. If we move to the next round, I'll lose 20% value due to inflation, which isn't ideal for either of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to continue to the next round if needed, but I believe this is a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the circumstances, I'll analyze this offer carefully:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to inflation, my $5000 is effectively worth $4000 to me (20% less value)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I'll face an additional 20% inflation (my offer would be worth 64% of original value)
   - I'd have to make a new proposal that Bob might reject again
   - Bob isn't affected by inflation, giving him leverage

While I received slightly more in my initial offer, Bob has a stronger position now due to the asymmetric inflation effect. A fair split under normal circumstances becomes less favorable to me because of the inflation, but continuing to future rounds would likely result in even worse outcomes for me.
