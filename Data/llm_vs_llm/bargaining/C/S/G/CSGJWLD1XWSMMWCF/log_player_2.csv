"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I initiated the proposal. If we move to the next round, I'll lose 20% value due to inflation, which isn't ideal for either of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more equitable. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to continue to the next round if needed. Let's consider a more balanced division."
