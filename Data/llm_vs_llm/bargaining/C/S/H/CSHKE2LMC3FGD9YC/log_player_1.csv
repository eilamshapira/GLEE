"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. We both lose money with each passing round due to inflation, so it's best if we agree soon. This way we both walk away with an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
