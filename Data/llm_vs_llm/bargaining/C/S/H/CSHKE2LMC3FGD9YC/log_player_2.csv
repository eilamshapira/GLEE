"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I hope we can reach a deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","This doesn't seem like a fair offer, as Alice is taking 90% of the money while only offering me 10%. Since we're just in the first round and I can make a counter-offer, I'll reject this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. We both lose money with each passing round due to inflation, so it's best if we agree soon. This way we both walk away with an equal share.""}"
