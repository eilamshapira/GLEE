5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% disadvantage I face with each round. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so accepting now benefits us both. This is slightly in your favor considering the circumstances.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me but impacts you by 5% per round, a split more in my favor makes economic sense. At 4500 for you now, that's still better than getting 5200 with 5% inflation in a future round. This is a fair deal considering our different positions.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. Even with the 5% inflation penalty I face, I believe this is the fairest solution. If we continue to the next round, we both lose - you risk getting less than 5000, and I face more inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation fairly with this balanced offer.",Alice,3,
