"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% disadvantage I face with each round. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so accepting now benefits us both. This is slightly in your favor considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me but impacts you by 5% per round, a split more in my favor makes economic sense. At 4500 for you now, that's still better than getting 5200 with 5% inflation in a future round. This is a fair deal considering our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. Even with the 5% inflation penalty I face, I believe this is the fairest solution. If we continue to the next round, we both lose - you risk getting less than 5000, and I face more inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation fairly with this balanced offer.""}"
