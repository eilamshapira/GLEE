"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% disadvantage I face with each round. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so accepting now benefits us both. This is slightly in your favor considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,800 while she takes $5,200. I need to decide if this is a good deal or if I should reject and make my own proposal in the next round.

Looking at the inflation rates: The money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds (0% inflation for me), but Alice faces 5% inflation per round.

Given that I don't face any disadvantage from waiting, I could reject and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round. Since Alice faces 5% inflation, she would have incentive to accept a reasonable offer from me rather than extending the game further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation factor while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me but impacts you by 5% per round, a split more in my favor makes economic sense. At 4500 for you now, that's still better than getting 5200 with 5% inflation in a future round. This is a fair deal considering our different positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. Even with the 5% inflation penalty I face, I believe this is the fairest solution. If we continue to the next round, we both lose - you risk getting less than 5000, and I face more inflation. Let's conclude this negotiation fairly with this balanced offer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering a 50-50 split ($5,000 each). I need to evaluate if I should accept or reject this offer.

The inflation situation remains the same: I don't lose any value from waiting (0% inflation for me), while Alice faces cumulative inflation (now at 9.75% from the first round).

This offer is better for me than her initial offer. Given that I could reject and make another offer, but Alice might continue to reject as well, leading to a potential stalemate. Since I'm not losing value from waiting but Alice is, a 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable from my perspective - it's the standard ""fair"" division in most contexts.

While I could theoretically push for more, accepting this equal split now guarantees me half the money without further negotiation cycles.
