Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, it seems the inflation is hitting you harder than you let on. I'm willing to be flexible, but 55/45 in your favor is not agreeable. Let's settle this with a 58/42 split, considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's inflation:**  The fact that Bob offered 55/45 in his favor after a 20% inflation hit on his potential gains suggests he might be underestimating the impact of inflation or is becoming more agreeable due to it.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering slightly less than my Round 1 offer but still a clear majority for myself maintains a firm stance while acknowledging the changing value. 
* **Time Pressure:** Every round costs us money. Getting closer to a deal is important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this round. It's crucial we reach an agreement soon to minimize further loss. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While inflation is hurting both of us, his offer suggests he believes I'm desperate. Accepting 40% when I initially aimed for 60% is a significant loss, even with the devaluation.
* **Potential for Bob to Crack:** Bob's increasing urgency implies he's also feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. Holding out might lead him to propose a more reasonable offer. 

It's a gamble, but I believe holding firm is the stronger move at this point."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This back and forth is hurting both of us. I'm sticking with 55/45, but this time it's in my favor.  Take it or leave it, but delaying further will only hurt us both."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  It's clear Bob is trying to exploit the situation.  A firm ""take it or leave it"" offer emphasizes the urgency without completely caving.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm mirroring Bob's previous 55/45 offer, highlighting the unfairness of his previous proposal while still allowing for a resolution.
* **Time Factor:**  Every round is costing us.  While I'm firm,  it's time to push for a final decision."
