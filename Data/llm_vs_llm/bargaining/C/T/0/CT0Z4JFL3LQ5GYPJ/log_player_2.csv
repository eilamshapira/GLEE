"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, Bob. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing that she gets $60 and I get $40 out of the $100. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider that if I reject, we'll move to round 2 where the total amount will be worth 10% less (only $90 total value). 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice might reject my offer as well, leading to further devaluation. Since I'm guaranteed $40 now, which is better than risking further rounds with diminishing returns, this is a reasonable offer.
