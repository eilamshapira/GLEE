"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly - a fair 50/50 divide. This way we both walk away with a good amount, and we don't risk losing value to inflation in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a perfectly equal split of $5000 each. Since there's no inflation affecting my portion in future rounds, I don't have any pressure to accept immediately from that perspective. However, this is a fair offer that gives me a substantial amount.

I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a less balanced offer, and we might end up in a back-and-forth that benefits neither of us.

Given that this is a fair offer and I have no disadvantage from inflation, I'll accept it.
