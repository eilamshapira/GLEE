"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. It's the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
3. The offer is fair and reasonable
4. By accepting now, we avoid any risk of getting nothing if negotiations fail
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a less favorable split
