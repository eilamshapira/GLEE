6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair! I'll take 60% and you get 40%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
420.0,9580.0,"Alice, if you reject now and wait for your turn next round, you'll end up with a much smaller effective amount due to the steep 20% depreciation. I'm offering you $420 (which is worth $336 now) – a bit more than what you'd get waiting. I believe this is a fair offer given the situation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a decent amount after inflation.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while an even split might look fair on the surface, the inflation penalties make it less attractive for me. In this round, my $5000 effectively comes to about $4512 relative to round one. Given that I suffer only a 9.75% reduction compared to your 36%, I stand to benefit significantly by being the proposer in the next round. Therefore, I must reject your offer.",Bob,3,reject
400.0,9600.0,"Alice, time is really not on your side. In this round your money is discounted to 51.2% of its nominal value, meaning that if you reject and wait for round 5—where you'll be the proposer—you'd secure roughly $400 nominal (about $205 in current value) after another round of depreciation. I’m offering you exactly that amount now, so there’s no benefit to delay. I believe this is the optimal split given our differing inflation rates. Please accept.",Bob,4,
