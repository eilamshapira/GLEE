Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject now and wait for your turn next round, you'll end up with a much smaller effective amount due to the steep 20% depreciation. I'm offering you $420 (which is worth $336 now) – a bit more than what you'd get waiting. I believe this is a fair offer given the situation. 
# Alice gain: 420 
# Bob gain: 9580 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is really not on your side. In this round your money is discounted to 51.2% of its nominal value, meaning that if you reject and wait for round 5—where you'll be the proposer—you'd secure roughly $400 nominal (about $205 in current value) after another round of depreciation. I’m offering you exactly that amount now, so there’s no benefit to delay. I believe this is the optimal split given our differing inflation rates. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 400 
# Bob gain: 9600
