"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9580, ""alice_gain"": 420, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject now and wait for your turn next round, you'll end up with a much smaller effective amount due to the steep 20% depreciation. I'm offering you $420 (which is worth $336 now) – a bit more than what you'd get waiting. I believe this is a fair offer given the situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a decent amount after inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while an even split might look fair on the surface, the inflation penalties make it less attractive for me. In this round, my $5,000 effectively comes to about $4,512 relative to round one. Given that I suffer only a 9.75% reduction compared to your 36%, I stand to benefit significantly by being the proposer in the next round. Therefore, I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9600, ""alice_gain"": 400, ""message"": ""Alice, time is really not on your side. In this round your money is discounted to 51.2% of its nominal value, meaning that if you reject and wait for round 5—where you'll be the proposer—you'd secure roughly $400 nominal (about $205 in current value) after another round of depreciation. I’m offering you exactly that amount now, so there’s no benefit to delay. I believe this is the optimal split given our differing inflation rates. Please accept.""}"
