"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will reduce my gains in future rounds. Since this is the first round, I'll aim for a balanced offer to increase the chances Bob accepts.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's reasonably fair, giving Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less
3. It gives me a slight advantage while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept now, my $450,000 is actually worth $360,000 to me (450,000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth only 64% of the original value due to compounding inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonably fair, and fighting for more might lead to greater losses due to inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and this is a reasonable split."
