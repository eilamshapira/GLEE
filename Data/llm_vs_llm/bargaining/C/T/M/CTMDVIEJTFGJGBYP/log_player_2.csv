"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice proposes an even 50-50 split, giving me $50 and taking $50 for herself. This is a perfectly fair first offer and represents an equal division of the money.

If I reject and we move to the next round, inflation would reduce the total value by 10%, leaving only $90 to split. Even if I managed to get a larger percentage in the next round, the total amount would be less.

Given that the first offer is already perfectly fair and delay would only reduce our total pot, I should accept.
