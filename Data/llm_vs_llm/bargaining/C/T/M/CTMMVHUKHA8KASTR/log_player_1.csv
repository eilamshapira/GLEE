"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round. 
* **Finding a Balance:** While I want to maximize my gain, offering Bob nothing in round 2 was too extreme. This offer is still advantageous to me but gives Bob a more significant share, increasing the chances he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is exploitative. While I understand the value is decreasing, I need to hold out for a more reasonable split. Accepting $1 sets a terrible precedent and Bob is likely to continue lowballing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money is quickly approaching a point where it won't be worth much. 
* **Final Offer:** This is a final attempt at a fair deal.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable outcome and Bob will likely accept knowing that if he rejects it, he risks getting even less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a surprising turn of events! While I would have preferred the 50/50 split, Bob offering me 80% is a great deal at this stage. The inflation means it's not as much as it would have been in earlier rounds, but it's still a significant amount and better than I could likely get in further rounds."
