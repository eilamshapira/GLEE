"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair opening offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slight advantage for myself to offset some of the inflation risk I face, while still keeping the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. This way we can both walk away with a good outcome without risking value loss through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $4000 is now effectively worth $3200 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob has the advantage now since inflation doesn't affect him
4. Even if I make another offer, Bob could reject again, leading to even worse outcomes for me

While this offer gives Bob a larger share, accepting it now guarantees me $3200 in effective value. Rejecting would likely lead to even worse outcomes due to inflation.
