"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the 10% inflation hit I'll take each round. I want to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept now, rather than risk further inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now, the value of the money for me is 10% less. Let's calculate what $4000 is worth to me now, compared to the original $5500 I asked for.

*   Original offer to me: $5500
*   Current offer to me: $4000
*   Value of money now: 90% of original value

So, $4000 now is worth $4000 * 1 = $4000 in original value to me.

Comparing this to my original proposal, accepting Bob's offer would result in me receiving less than my initial proposal ($4000 vs $5500).

Given this, I will reject the offer and try to make another offer next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I rejected Bob's offer. This round, the money I receive will be worth 81% (90% * 90%) of its original value. I need to factor this additional inflation into my proposal.

I need to make an offer that gives Bob enough to accept, but also compensates me for the continued depreciation of the money's value. I'll try to be more aggressive this time, but not so much that Bob rejects it outright.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer again. Now the value of the money is 27.1% less than the original. That means $1 is worth $0.729 compared to the first round.

Bob is offering me $4200. Let's see what that's worth in original dollars:

$4200 * 1 = $4200

The value I'm getting compared to the first round is low. I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I rejected Bob's offer again. This round, the money I receive will be worth approximately 59.05% of its original value.

The value of my gain decrease exponentially, I have to make a final offer to Bob to maximise my gain.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer, and now the money is worth approximately 59.05% of its original value (1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905). Bob is offering me $4500.

Let's calculate the equivalent value in the first round:

$4500 * 1 = $4500

Given the inflation, this is still not good.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is killing me. I need to make a VERY aggressive offer, hoping Bob will finally take it.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500
}
```"
