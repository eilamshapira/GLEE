"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the 5% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $100. This is a fair division that gives us equal shares, and accepting now means we both avoid losing value to inflation in future rounds."
