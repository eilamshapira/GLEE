"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, meaning the total value to me would be $9,500. I would then make the next offer.

Given the inflation penalty that only affects me, and the fact that we have 12 rounds total, it might be reasonable to negotiate for a better split. If I reject now, I can propose a more favorable distribution in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money. This is a fair solution that gives us both equal shares of the total amount. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round and you don't, an equal split now would benefit both of us by avoiding further rounds of negotiation and depreciation of the money's value to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has increased her proposal to me from $4,000 to $4,200, while reducing her take from $6,000 to $5,800.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round. This means the $4,200 offer is effectively worth $3,790.50 to me (calculated as $4,200 Ã— (1-0.0975)).

If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where I'll make an offer, but the inflation penalty will increase to approximately 14.75%. This continued inflation diminishes my bargaining power with each round.

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by improving her offer slightly. While I could reject and counter-offer, the inflation penalty makes prolonged negotiation increasingly costly for me.
