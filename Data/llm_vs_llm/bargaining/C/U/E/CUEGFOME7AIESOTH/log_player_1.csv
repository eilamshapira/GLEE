"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that time pressure from inflation affects me. I want to start with a reasonable split to encourage cooperation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split because it's close to equal while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. This leaves room for negotiation while being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation affecting the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is too unfavorable to me, especially since inflation is affecting my gains less than Bob's at this point (10% vs 20%). I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, even accounting for the additional inflation that will occur."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that my gains are now worth 20% less and Bob's gains are worth 30% less than the initial round, I'll adjust my offer to account for this inflation differential.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm proposing this split because with the current inflation levels (20% for me, 30% for Bob), my 5800 is effectively worth 4640, and Bob's 4200 is worth 2940. This seems fair while accounting for the inflation impact, and it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon before further inflation erodes the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation is becoming significant (my gains are worth 27.1% less, making the $4200 effectively worth about $3062)
2. Bob's gains are being hit harder by inflation (48.8% reduction)
3. If we continue negotiating, both our potential gains will keep decreasing
4. This split is more reasonable than Bob's previous offer
5. We're already in round 4, and with 12 rounds maximum, we need to reach an agreement before both of us get nothing

Better to secure this deal now than risk further value erosion through continued negotiation."
