"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable first offer considering I have less time pressure due to my lower inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. Even considering the inflation effect (5% for me), I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. The money is worth significantly less for Bob now (20% less), so he should be more willing to accept a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider that the money is worth 10% less for me (5% × 2 rounds) and 40% less for Bob (20% × 2 rounds) compared to the initial value. Given Bob's higher inflation rate, I'll make a more moderate offer than my first one.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a more balanced offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's still too unfavorable. Even with my 14.26% inflation penalty, $30 is too low. Bob's money is now worth less than half its original value (48.8% less), which means he should be more motivated to reach a fair agreement soon. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that could be more appealing to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given we're in round 5, my money is worth about 19% less and Bob's is worth about 59% less than the initial value. Bob's rapidly decreasing value should make him more willing to accept a reasonable offer now.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and Bob gets $48. This is an even more balanced offer that acknowledges the urgency created by our inflation rates, especially Bob's. Given that Bob's money has lost more than half its value, this is a fair proposal that should be attractive to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though we're in round 6 and my money is worth 22.62% less, $25 is still too low. Bob's money has lost over two-thirds of its value (67.23% less), which means he's in a much worse position by continuing to delay. His high inflation rate should make him more willing to accept a fairer split in the next round. I'll make a more compromising offer next time, but $25 is simply too low for me to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 7, with my money worth about 26% less and Bob's worth about 74% less than the initial value. Given Bob's severe value loss and the fact that we only have 5 rounds left, it's crucial to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I propose I get $48 and Bob gets $52. I'm now offering Bob the larger share to encourage acceptance. Given that Bob's money has lost nearly three-quarters of its value, this offer should be particularly attractive to him. The fact that I'm willing to take less than half shows my commitment to reaching an agreement before we both end up with nothing."
