"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. In round 1, I valued $1 as $1. Now, in round 2, $1 is worth $0.90 to me.

Bob's offer gives me $45. Because of inflation, this is worth $45 * 0.90 = $40.50 in terms of its value to me as of round 1.

Since I was offered $60 in the first round and now I am being offered what has the same value as $40.50, I should reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll make an offer for round 3. Remember that $1 is now worth only $0.81 to me (10% less than round 2, or 0.9 * 0.9).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
