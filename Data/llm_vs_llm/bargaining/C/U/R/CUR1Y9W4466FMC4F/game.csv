60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects you more strongly (20% vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid amount while acknowledging my slightly better position.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think this split makes more sense. It's better for you to accept this offer rather than prolonging the negotiations and losing more value to inflation.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I've moved from my initial position to offer a more balanced 55-45 split. With your 20% inflation penalty versus my 5%, accepting now is clearly in your interest. If we go another round, your $45 would be worth only $36 to you, while my inflation impact is much smaller. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.",Alice,3,
