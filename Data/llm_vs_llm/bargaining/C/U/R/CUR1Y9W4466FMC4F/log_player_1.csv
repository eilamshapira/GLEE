"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects you more strongly (20% vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid amount while acknowledging my slightly better position.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think this split makes more sense. It's better for you to accept this offer rather than prolonging the negotiations and losing more value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've moved from my initial position to offer a more balanced 55-45 split. With your 20% inflation penalty versus my 5%, accepting now is clearly in your interest. If we go another round, your $45 would be worth only $36 to you, while my inflation impact is much smaller. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.""}"
