"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects you more strongly (20% vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a solid amount while acknowledging my slightly better position. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think this split makes more sense. It's better for you to accept this offer rather than prolonging the negotiations and losing more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've moved from my initial position to offer a more balanced 55-45 split. With your 20% inflation penalty versus my 5%, accepting now is clearly in your interest. If we go another round, your $45 would be worth only $36 to you, while my inflation impact is much smaller. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
