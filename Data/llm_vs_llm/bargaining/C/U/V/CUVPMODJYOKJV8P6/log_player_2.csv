"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60.

I need to consider that with each passing round, money is worth 20% less to me (while only 10% less to Alice). This means if I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total value is already reduced for both of us.

If I reject now, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round. Even if I manage to get more than $40 in absolute terms later, I need to get at least $50 in round 2 to match the current $40 offer's value.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the risk of continuing many rounds, this isn't a terrible initial offer. However, I think I can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer that considers our different inflation rates while trying to reach a fair compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both a substantial portion, while accounting for the fact that delays hurt me more than they hurt Alice due to our different inflation rates."
