"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers our different inflation rates. Since inflation impacts me more severely (20% vs. 5% for Bob), I should aim for a fair initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we divide the $100 so I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering that if we delay, inflation will hurt my share more significantly than yours. I believe this balanced approach gives us both a good outcome without risking value loss through extended negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the increasing inflation effects as we continue negotiating. The money is now worth 40% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect our changing positions due to inflation. Since delay affects me more severely than you, I propose a split where I get $52 and you get $48. This is actually a more favorable offer for you than my first proposal, and given the mounting inflation pressure on my end, I hope we can reach an agreement now rather than continue to lose value through further delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to recognize the severe impact of inflation at this point. The money is now worth 59.04% less for me and 18.55% less for Bob compared to round 1, which significantly changes our negotiating positions.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering a split where I receive $48 and you receive $52. This gives you the majority share now, acknowledging that further delays would hurt me disproportionately due to our different inflation rates. At this stage, we've both lost substantial value through inflation, and continuing to negotiate would only diminish the total value further. I hope we can reach an agreement with this compromise."
