"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the risk you took by rejecting my previous offer, while still leaving you a significant share of the pot. Let's be fair and reach a solution before inflation takes hold. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
