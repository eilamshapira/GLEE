4000.0,6000.0,"Since you face 20% inflation per round while I face none, waiting costs you more than it costs me. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your money would be worth less. This is a fair split considering the game's dynamics.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm still willing to give you a significant share. Accepting this offer will give you a good amount, and I'll get a fair share as well. Let's end the game before further inflation affects my share.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Since we're now in round 4, your money has already lost significant value due to inflation. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $3500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Given that I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to wait, but accepting this deal would be beneficial for both of us.",Bob,4,
