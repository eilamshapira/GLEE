"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 20% inflation per round while I face none, waiting costs you more than it costs me. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your money would be worth less. This is a fair split considering the game's dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, if I accept the offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth $4000 to me in this round. If I reject it, the $10,000 will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, making it worth $8000 to me, but then it will be my turn to propose again.

Given Bob's offer, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, and this is the second round of inflation for me, the $10,000 is now worth $6400 to me (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8). However, for the sake of the proposal, I'll still consider the original $10,000 amount.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm still willing to give you a significant share. Accepting this offer will give you a good amount, and I'll get a fair share as well. Let's end the game before further inflation affects my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're now in round 4, your money has already lost significant value due to inflation. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $3500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Given that I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to wait, but accepting this deal would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 48.8% reduction in value due to inflation, the $10,000 is now worth approximately $5130 to me (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8).

Bob's offer of $3500 is roughly 68% of the value I perceive the total amount to be worth to me at this point. While it's a significant portion, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

However, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, I should consider the potential losses in future rounds. If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value of the money will decrease even further.

In this case, I think accepting Bob's offer might be the best option to minimize my losses.
