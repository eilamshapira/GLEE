"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering an even split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000 and her $5,000. While this is a fair division in general, I should consider the inflation effect in this game.

For me, inflation is 0%, so the money maintains its value across all rounds. For Alice, however, money loses 20% of its value each round. This gives me a strategic advantage if we move to later rounds, as Alice will be more motivated to accept a lesser amount rather than face further devaluation.

Given this dynamic, I believe I can propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a split that takes into account the inflation dynamics while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since you face 20% inflation per round while I face none, waiting costs you more than it costs me. This offer gives you $4,000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your money would be worth less. This is a fair split considering the game's dynamics.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm still willing to give you a significant share. Accepting this offer will give you a good amount, and I'll get a fair share as well. Let's end the game before further inflation affects my share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for herself. This is a step backward from my previous offer where I proposed getting $6,000. 

The inflation factor continues to work in my favor. For Alice, money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, whereas my money maintains its full value. This means Alice should be increasingly motivated to reach an agreement as the rounds progress.

Given that I face no inflation penalty and Alice's bargaining position weakens with each round, I believe I can get a better offer by rejecting this proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Since we're now in round 4, your money has already lost significant value due to inflation. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $3,500 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Given that I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to wait, but accepting this deal would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
