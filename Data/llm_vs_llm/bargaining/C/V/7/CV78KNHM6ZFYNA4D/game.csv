60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $60 and you get $40. Accepting this offer now means you secure your $40 without any loss due to inflation. If we delay, both of us will see our money's value drop—especially mine, but yours falls too, albeit less steeply. Let's avoid unnecessary devaluation and settle the deal in Round 1.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be fair. While your money devalues faster, we both lose with every round. I'm offering you a 45/55 split, which is closer to a 50/50 than your initial proposal.  This way, we can both get more and avoid losing too much to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your fair proposal. Given the inflation hit I face—my share's effective worth drops by 20% each round—I recognize that delaying will only hurt my outcome further. I appreciate the effort to balance our interests and ensure both of us get a reasonable share, so I'm accepting your 45/55 offer.",Alice,2,accept
