"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $60 and you get $40. Accepting this offer now means you secure your $40 without any loss due to inflation. If we delay, both of us will see our money's value dropâ€”especially mine, but yours falls too, albeit less steeply. Let's avoid unnecessary devaluation and settle the deal in Round 1. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. While your money devalues faster, we both lose with every round. I'm offering you a 45/55 split, which is closer to a 50/50 than your initial proposal.  This way, we can both get more and avoid losing too much to inflation.""}
