"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because while I want a favorable outcome for myself, I also want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk value loss through inflation in subsequent rounds. The 60-40 split gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still potentially get a better deal in the next round. The current offer would give me $4,500 (worth $4,275 after 5% inflation), which is significantly less than my initial proposal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that might be more mutually beneficial."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more moderate than my first proposal, considering we're now in round 3 and my gains are worth 10% less due to inflation. This 55-45 split would give me $5,500 (worth $4,950 after 10% inflation) while giving Bob $4,500. This is a more balanced offer that hopefully Bob will find acceptable, as continuing to negotiate will further erode my potential gains due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with the increasing inflation penalty (14.26%), my $4,800 would be worth approximately $4,115 after inflation. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation penalty will keep increasing, further eroding my potential gains. Additionally, Bob's offer has improved from his last one, and there's no guarantee that future negotiations would result in a better outcome for me given the inflation pressure. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further value loss."
