"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it closer to even, given the inflationary effect on me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected and the money he gains is worth 10% less again, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is catching up with you, let's settle before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle evenly; it's the best way to counter the inflation effect. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split! Considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain (27.1% less than the original value), I think this is a reasonable offer. It's better to accept a fair deal now rather than risking further inflation erosion of Bob's value.
