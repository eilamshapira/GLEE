"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, taking into account that we both lose value in future rounds and need to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split considering that I lose value faster (10% per round) compared to Bob's 5% loss per round. If we delay, we both lose more, so it's in our mutual interest to agree quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

With the current inflation:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45, but it's worth 10% less than round 1, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and we continue to next round, any future gains will be worth even less
- Bob's offer is somewhat fair considering the total amount
- Prolonging the negotiation will reduce both our gains

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the risk of further value loss and the possibility of not reaching an agreement within the time limit makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice.
