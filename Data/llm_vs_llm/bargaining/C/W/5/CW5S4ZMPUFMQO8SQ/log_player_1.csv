"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that Bob's money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't lose value, Bob has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than half, but not so much that Bob would definitely reject it.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair offer considering I'm letting Bob keep 40% of the total amount. If Bob rejects this, their share will be worth less in the next round due to the 20% inflation penalty on their side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $6800, which is better than my initial offer of $6000
2. Bob takes $3200, which for them is now worth only $2560 (due to 20% inflation)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But Bob's share will be worth another 20% less
   - Bob might be more desperate to accept
   
However, this is already a very good offer for me ($6800 is 68% of the total), and trying to get more might risk Bob making a worse offer in retaliation.
