{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This way, we both get a good portion, and we can avoid the risk of inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want more, but 60/40 is too skewed. Inflation hurts us both. How about a 55/45 split for me? This acknowledges your time while giving me a better share considering the upcoming inflation for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
