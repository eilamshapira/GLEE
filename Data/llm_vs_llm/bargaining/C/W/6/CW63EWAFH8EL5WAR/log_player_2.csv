  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want more, but 60/40 is too skewed. Inflation hurts us both. How about a 55/45 split for me? This acknowledges your time while giving me a better share considering the upcoming inflation for me.""

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option, especially with inflation starting to bite.  It's time to be reasonable, Bob. Let's both walk away with something good. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
