Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Since each round makes the money worth less for me, I'd like a bit more to balance things out. How about 60-40 in my favor?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45-55 in your favor. This way, you get more than half, considering your situation, but it's still fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
