"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation for me in later rounds, I propose a division where I take $40 and you get $60. This deal reflects the current value of the money and benefits us both by concluding the game immediately. I hope you find it fair and acceptable.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the devaluation of money for you in each round, I propose a division of $65 for me and $35 for you. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the decreasing value of money on your side. I believe it's a reasonable offer, and accepting it would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
