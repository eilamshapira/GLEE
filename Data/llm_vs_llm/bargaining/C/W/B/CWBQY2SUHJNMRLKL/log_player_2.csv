"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation for me in later rounds, I propose a division where I take $40 and you get $60. This deal reflects the current value of the money and benefits us both by concluding the game immediately. I hope you find it fair and acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the devaluation of money for you in each round, I propose a division of $65 for me and $35 for you. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the decreasing value of money on your side. I believe it's a reasonable offer, and accepting it would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
