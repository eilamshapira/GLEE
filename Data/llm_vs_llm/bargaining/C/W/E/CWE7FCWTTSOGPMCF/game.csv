600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given that the money is worth 10% less to you this round, this offer of $450000 is actually worth more to you now than your original offer would be to you in this round ($540000). Let's conclude this efficiently.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, it seems we both want this settled quickly. I'm adjusting my offer slightly for a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is money, and it's depreciating fast for me!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Consider this carefully, Alice. Due to the 29% devaluation on your side, $400000 now is equivalent to about $568000 from round 1 for you. If we continue further, the devaluation will only get worse. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. This stalemate benefits no one. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances and avoids further losses for me due to the time pressure.",Alice,5,
