Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that the money is worth 10% less to you this round, this offer of $450000 is actually worth more to you now than your original offer would be to you in this round ($540000). Let's conclude this efficiently.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider this carefully, Alice. Due to the 29% devaluation on your side, $400000 now is equivalent to about $568000 from round 1 for you. If we continue further, the devaluation will only get worse. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}

Bob's math is off, but more importantly, he's using misleading framing to pressure me.  While he's right that the devaluation is significant, he's trying to make me compare apples to oranges. 

Here's why:

* **He's ignoring his own gains:** Bob continuously benefits from the time pressure, as his money doesn't devalue. By round 4, getting $600,000 is a *much* better deal for him than it would have been in Round 1. 
* **Future devaluation is uncertain:** Yes, the longer we wait, the worse it gets for me. But, there's a chance Bob might panic and offer me a better deal if I hold out longer. It's a gamble, but I'm not accepting a bad deal just because he's trying to scare me.

I need to present a firm offer that reflects the real value, even with the devaluation."
