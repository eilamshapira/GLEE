"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers me 400,000$ (40%) and keeps 600,000$ (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means her 600,000$ would only be worth 540,000$ to her in the next round
5. I can leverage this to get a better deal by making a counter-offer
6. Since the money doesn't devalue for me, I maintain negotiating power

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, using Alice's time pressure to my advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her this round:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that the money is worth 10% less to you this round, this offer of $450,000 is actually worth more to you now than your original offer would be to you in this round ($540,000). Let's conclude this efficiently.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It gives me a better share (55%)
2. For Alice, $450,000 now is better than her original $600,000 devalued by 10% ($540,000)
3. The message emphasizes the time pressure on her side
4. It's still a reasonable offer that she might accept to avoid further devaluation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want this settled quickly. I'm adjusting my offer slightly for a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is money, and it's depreciating fast for me! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice offers me 450,000$ (45%) and keeps 550,000$ (55%)
2. Due to 19% inflation for Alice, her 550,000$ is only worth about 445,500$ to her
3. If I reject, I can make another offer next round
4. In the next round, Alice's money will be worth 29% less than the first round
5. I still have strong negotiating power since my money doesn't devalue
6. While this is better than her first offer, I can still push for more

Given that Alice is under increasing time pressure and my position remains strong, I'll reject this offer and make a more aggressive proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is now worth 29% less this round, I'll make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully, Alice. Due to the 29% devaluation on your side, $400,000 now is equivalent to about $568,000 from round 1 for you. If we continue further, the devaluation will only get worse. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I'm increasing my share to 60%, but presenting it in a way that shows it's rational given the devaluation
2. For Alice, $400,000 now is better than dealing with further 10% devaluations in future rounds
3. The message emphasizes the growing time pressure on her side
4. It's still a reasonable enough offer that she might accept to avoid further losses
5. I maintain my strong negotiating position since my money doesn't devalue"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This stalemate benefits no one. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances and avoids further losses for me due to the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this 50/50 offer:

1. Alice offers me 500,000$ (50%) - a significant improvement from her previous offers
2. Her 500,000$ is only worth about 328,000$ to her due to 34.39% devaluation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have 44.39% devaluation for Alice
   - I can make an even more aggressive offer
   - However, we risk entering a destructive cycle
4. This is a substantial concession from Alice
5. 500,000$ is a good outcome for me, considering we started with a 40% offer

While I could theoretically push for more, this seems like a fair and rational point to conclude. The offer is significantly better than where we started, and further rounds might lead to a less cooperative dynamic.
