Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's important to act fast with this inflation thing.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we adjust to a 55/45 split? It balances things more fairly considering the inflation impact on you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
