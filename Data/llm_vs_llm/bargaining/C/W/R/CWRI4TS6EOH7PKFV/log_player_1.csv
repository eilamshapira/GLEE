"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob in this money-dividing game.

Given the 10% inflation effect for me each round, I should aim for a fair but favorable offer that Bob would accept now. If he declines, I'll get less value in the next round even if I get the same nominal amount.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we divide the money with me receiving $5,500 and Bob receiving $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than moving to the next round where inflation will affect my gains."
