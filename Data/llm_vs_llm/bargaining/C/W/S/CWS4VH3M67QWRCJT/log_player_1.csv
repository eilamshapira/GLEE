"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob. Since this is the first round and I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount rather than risking inflation by extending the negotiation."
