"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the information, I need to calculate the value of the money to me, considering the 20% inflation.

In round 1, I was offered $60. Now I need to calculate how much is that worth, so:

$60 - (20% of $60) = $60 - $12 = $48

Then, I will decide based on the offer in Round 2.

Here's my decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me than in the previous round.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

First, let's calculate the value of the $40 offered to me in this round, considering the accumulated inflation (48.8% less than in Round 1).

Value of $100 in round 1: $100
Value of $40 in round 4: $40 - (48.8% of $40) = $40 - $19.52 = $20.48

So, I'm effectively getting $20.48 in value if I accept. I need to make a decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. Remember, the money is worth even less for me now due to continued inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```"
