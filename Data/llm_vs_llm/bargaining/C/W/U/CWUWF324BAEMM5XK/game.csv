50000.0,950000.0,"Hi Bob – I know we both lose value as rounds pass (I lose 10% per round, you 5%), so waiting won’t help either of us very much. In round 2 you’d be in the driver’s seat, but the best you can secure then is roughly what you’d get now – about $950000 in value. To avoid further depreciation, I propose we settle today: I take $50000 and you get $950000. I believe this offer exactly matches your continuation value if you waited one more round. Let me know your thoughts.",Alice,1,
