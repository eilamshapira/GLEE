"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I know we both lose value as rounds pass (I lose 10% per round, you 5%), so waiting won’t help either of us very much. In round 2 you’d be in the driver’s seat, but the best you can secure then is roughly what you’d get now – about $950000 in value. To avoid further depreciation, I propose we settle today: I take $50000 and you get $950000. I believe this offer exactly matches your continuation value if you waited one more round. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 950000 
# Alice gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's proposal carefully. 

She's offering me $950,000 and taking $50,000 for herself. She claims this matches what I'd get if I rejected and proposed in the next round.

Let me check this logic: If I reject, in round 2 I could propose a split. But the total pot would be worth 5% less to me (worth $950,000 to me) and 10% less to Alice. So even if I proposed taking everything in round 2, the maximum value I could get is $950,000.

Alice's current offer gives me exactly $950,000, which matches my best possible outcome if I waited. Given that any delay reduces our total value, and I can't improve my position by waiting, accepting now is rational.
