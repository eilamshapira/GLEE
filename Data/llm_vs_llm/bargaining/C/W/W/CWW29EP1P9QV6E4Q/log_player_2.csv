"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. For me, the money value stays the same
5. This means in the next round, the 1,000,000$ will only be worth 950,000$ to Alice
6. I can use this to negotiate a better deal for myself

I'll reject this offer since I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Alice's position is weaker due to the 5% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is now worth 5% less to Alice (so the total $1,000,000 is only worth $950,000 to her), I can use this to make a more favorable offer for myself while still making it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

If she rejects my offer, in the next round the money will be worth another 5% less to her (worth only $902,500), weakening her position further.

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than Alice's original offer while still being reasonable enough for her to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me more than the original 400,000$ while still giving Alice a substantial amount that's worth accepting now rather than risking further depreciation of value in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has slightly improved her offer to me (from 400,000$ to 420,000$)
2. For Alice, the 580,000$ she's asking for is actually only worth about 523,450$ (due to 9.75% depreciation)
3. If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - The money will be worth 14.75% less to Alice
   - The money will still be worth the same to me
4. Alice's bargaining position is getting weaker with each round
5. I can likely get a better deal in the next round

Since Alice's position continues to weaken and my position stays strong, I'll reject this offer and make a more aggressive proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is now worth 14.75% less to Alice, I'm in an even stronger negotiating position. From Alice's perspective, the total $1,000,000 is only worth about $852,500 to her now.

If she rejects this offer, in the next round the money will be worth nearly 20% less to her, making her position even weaker. She should be more motivated to accept a deal now rather than risk further depreciation.

I'll make a more aggressive offer that takes advantage of this situation:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000}

This offer gives me significantly more than previous offers, but for Alice, accepting $350,000 now is better than risking further depreciation in future rounds. Even though it's a smaller nominal amount, it's better for her to accept now than to continue negotiating while her purchasing power decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me 440,000$ (up from her previous 420,000$)
2. For Alice, her 560,000$ is only worth about 456,120$ (due to 18.55% depreciation)
3. If I reject, I get another round where:
   - The money will be worth about 23.55% less to Alice
   - My value stays the same
   - I can make another offer

However, I should also consider:
1. We've gone through several rounds already
2. Although Alice's value is decreasing, she's not making major concessions
3. This could potentially go on for many more rounds with small incremental changes
4. 440,000$ is a significant improvement from her first offer of 400,000$

While I could potentially get more by continuing, there's also a risk of this dragging on with diminishing returns. The 440,000$ offer is a reasonable compromise.
