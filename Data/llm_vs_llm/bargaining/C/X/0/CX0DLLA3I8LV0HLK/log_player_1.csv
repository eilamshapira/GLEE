"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, taking into account that the value of money stays the same for me but decreases by 10% each round for him.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose a slightly favorable split for myself, but still very reasonable for Bob. Since Bob faces a 10% reduction in value if we move to the next round, this offer should be attractive to him. It's close to an even split while giving me a small advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since it gives me less than what I initially proposed. Since I don't face any inflation penalty across rounds, I can make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account our negotiation dynamics and the inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 540000, 
""bob_gain"": 460000}

Since Bob rejected my initial offer and tried to claim more for himself, I'm slightly increasing my share compared to my first offer. This is still reasonable because the money is worth 19% less to Bob in the next round (due to compounding 10% inflation), so accepting this offer now is better for him than continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
