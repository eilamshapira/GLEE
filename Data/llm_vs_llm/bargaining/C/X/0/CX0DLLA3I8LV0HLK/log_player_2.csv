Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than half of the original amount, considering the devaluation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 19% devaluation, the $460,000 I would gain is actually worth $460,000 * 0.81 = $372,600 to me.

I'll think about whether this is a good deal for me...

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me after the first two rounds and now another 10% less after the third round (for a total of 29.1% less, or 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729), the total amount I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.729 = $729,000.
