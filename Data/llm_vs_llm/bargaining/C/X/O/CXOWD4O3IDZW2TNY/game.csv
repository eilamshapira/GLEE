4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand inflation affects you more, but that actually gives me more leverage in later rounds. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which still gives you $4500. This is fair considering the time pressure affects you more significantly. If we keep going back and forth, the total amount for both of us decreases substantially - especially for you with your 20% inflation rate. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, your offer is not acceptable. The inflation is affecting me more, but 55-45 is too much in your favor. I propose 52-48. This is a more reasonable compromise, acknowledging the inflation difference. Let's get this done now.",Alice,3,
