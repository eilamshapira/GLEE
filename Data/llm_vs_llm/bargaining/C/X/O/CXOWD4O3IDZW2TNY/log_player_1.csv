"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand inflation affects you more, but that actually gives me more leverage in later rounds. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which still gives you $4500. This is fair considering the time pressure affects you more significantly. If we keep going back and forth, the total amount for both of us decreases substantially - especially for you with your 20% inflation rate. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
