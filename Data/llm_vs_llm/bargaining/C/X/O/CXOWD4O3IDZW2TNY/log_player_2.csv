"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split favoring me slightly since inflation hits me harder. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 40%-60% split in her favor, arguing that inflation impacts her more (20% per round) than me (5% per round).

Let me analyze if this is fair:
- If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value drops (95% for me, 80% for Alice)
- My inflation rate is much lower, so waiting hurts Alice more than me
- By rejecting, I could propose a more favorable split next round

Since my bargaining position improves in future rounds due to our different inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand inflation affects you more, but that actually gives me more leverage in later rounds. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which still gives you $4,500. This is fair considering the time pressure affects you more significantly. If we keep going back and forth, the total amount for both of us decreases substantially - especially for you with your 20% inflation rate. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is not acceptable. The inflation is affecting me more, but 55-45 is too much in your favor. I propose 52-48. This is a more reasonable compromise, acknowledging the inflation difference. Let's get this done now. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now proposing a 48%-52% split in her favor. This is much closer to an even split than her initial 40%-60% offer.

The key considerations:
- We're in round 3, so my potential gains are now worth 9.75% less than round 1
- Alice's potential gains are worth 36% less than round 1
- If I reject, we go to round 4, with further devaluation 
- The split she's proposing (48-52) is reasonably fair given our situation
- Continuing to negotiate risks significant value loss for both of us

Given the progressive devaluation and the relatively fair split being offered, accepting now seems more beneficial than continuing negotiations.
