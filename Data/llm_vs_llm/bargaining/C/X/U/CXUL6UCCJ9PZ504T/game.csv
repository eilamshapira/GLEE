0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the full $100 and I get $0. If you decline, you'll be making the proposal next round and can secure $100 anyway, while my share would be worth 5% less per round of delay. Since waiting only harms my position without benefiting you, I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,1,

5.0,95.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'd like to secure some of it. You get $5 in this round, which will be worth less in future rounds due to the 5% inflation per round. Accepting this offer ensures you get something. Let's settle now.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I'll accept your offer. While my $5 in round 2 is discounted (worth about $4.75 in round‑1 value), it's still better than the alternative I face by rejecting and taking my turn in round 3, where strategic backward‐induction shows I’d be forced to concede nearly everything. So, let's settle with you receiving $95 and me $5 for this round.",Alice,2,accept
