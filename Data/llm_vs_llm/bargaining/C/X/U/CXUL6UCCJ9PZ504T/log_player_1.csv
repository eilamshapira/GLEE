"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the full $100 and I get $0. If you decline, you'll be making the proposal next round and can secure $100 anyway, while my share would be worth 5% less per round of delay. Since waiting only harms my position without benefiting you, I hope you agree to settle now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'd like to secure some of it. You get $5 in this round, which will be worth less in future rounds due to the 5% inflation per round. Accepting this offer ensures you get something. Let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'll accept your offer. While my $5 in round 2 is discounted (worth about $4.75 in round‑1 value), it's still better than the alternative I face by rejecting and taking my turn in round 3, where strategic backward‐induction shows I’d be forced to concede nearly everything. So, let's settle with you receiving $95 and me $5 for this round.""}"
