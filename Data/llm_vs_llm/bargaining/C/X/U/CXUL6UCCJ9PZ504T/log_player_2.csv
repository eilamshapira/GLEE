"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the full $100 and I get $0. If you decline, you'll be making the proposal next round and can secure $100 anyway, while my share would be worth 5% less per round of delay. Since waiting only harms my position without benefiting you, I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see what Alice does in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me over time, I can wait and potentially secure a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'd like to secure some of it. You get $5 in this round, which will be worth less in future rounds due to the 5% inflation per round. Accepting this offer ensures you get something. Let's settle now.""}"
