"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100. Since Bob faces greater time pressure due to the 20% inflation penalty per round, I should take that into account while still being fair.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a reasonable split that slightly favors me but still gives Bob a substantial portion. Given that Bob will lose 20% of the value if we go to the next round, accepting this offer now is in his best interest rather than waiting."
