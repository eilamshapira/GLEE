"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $45 out of $100, which is a reasonable split but not quite 50-50. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in the next round, the $100 would only be worth $80 to me.

If I were to get an even 50-50 split ($50) in the next round, it would actually be worth $40 to me due to the 20% inflation penalty. That's less than the $45 Alice is offering now.

Given the inflation penalty I face, this is actually a good offer for me.
