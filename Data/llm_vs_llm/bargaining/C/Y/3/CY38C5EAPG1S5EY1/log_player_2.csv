"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite heavily skewed in her favor. She's proposing to take 80% of the money while giving me only 20%. Given that inflation doesn't affect me but affects Alice by 20% per round, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty per round and I don't, I'll propose a more equitable split that still gives her incentive to accept rather than continuing to the next round where her share would be worth less.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Alice 400,000 dollars, which is a fair split considering the inflation penalty she faces. If she rejects and we go to round 3, her money will be worth 20% less, so this offer should be attractive to her while being much better for me than her initial proposal."
