"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'll take 60 and you take 40. How about it? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer given the different inflation rates.

If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, but only 5% less to Alice. This gives her a significant advantage if we delay agreement. By the final round, the money would be worth much less to me.

Given this asymmetry, a 40-60 split in round 1 is actually reasonable, considering my stronger pressure to reach an early agreement.
