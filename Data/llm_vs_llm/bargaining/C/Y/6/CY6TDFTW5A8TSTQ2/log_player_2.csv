Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as compensation for you trying to take a larger share last round. This is still very equitable, and we should agree now before inflation reduces our total value further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While I understand Alice wanting a slight advantage, the proposed split doesn't feel worthwhile considering the initial 50/50 offer was on the table.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a larger share without being greedy."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to be reasonable. This offer is a compromise between my previous proposal and your desire for a fairer split. Let's close the deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
