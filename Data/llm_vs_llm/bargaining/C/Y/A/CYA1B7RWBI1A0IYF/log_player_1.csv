"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer while considering that Bob loses more value than I do in later rounds (10% vs 5% depreciation).

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair split that slightly favors me. If we delay, your money will be worth less due to 10% depreciation per round. This is a good deal for both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Given the depreciation rates, it's in both our interests to agree sooner rather than later. This way, we both get a fair share without risking further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation in round 2:
- My $5000 would be worth $4750 (5% less)
- Bob's $5000 would be worth $4500 (10% less)

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
- Values will depreciate further
- Bob might reject again, leading to more losses

3. This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's a fair 50-50 split
- Even with depreciation, I'm getting $4750 in effective value
- Making another offer risks further depreciation
