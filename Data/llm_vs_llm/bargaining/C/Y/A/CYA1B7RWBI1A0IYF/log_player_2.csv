"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair split that slightly favors me. If we delay, your money will be worth less due to 10% depreciation per round. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's calculate the value of the money after the first round, considering the depreciation.

For me (Bob), the $4800 offered is worth $4800 in this round, but if I reject, its value will decrease by 10% in the next round. For Alice, the $5200 is worth $5200, and her decrease is 5% per round.

Given that the offer is $4800 for me and $5200 for Alice, and considering the depreciation rates, I should evaluate if making a counteroffer in the next round would be beneficial, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

However, since this is the first round and the depreciation hasn't affected the value yet, I should consider the immediate benefit of accepting $4800 versus the potential for a better offer later, which would be diminished by the 10% depreciation for me.

Considering these factors, I decide to reject the offer because I believe I can negotiate a better split in the next round, despite the risk of depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the depreciation, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Given that the money is worth 10% less for me after this round, I need to balance my offer to ensure I get a fair share while also considering Alice's 5% depreciation.

My offer will be:
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. Given the depreciation rates, it's in both our interests to agree sooner rather than later. This way, we both get a fair share without risking further value loss.""}

This offer splits the $10,000 evenly between us, which seems like a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the depreciation factor."
