"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the pace of depreciation—20% for me and 10% for you in every round—I’ve structured this proposal so you get exactly what you'd expect if you waited for your turn to propose next (approximately 0.9*(1-0.8)/(1-0.72) of the total). Accepting now gives you 7142.86 and me 2857.14 in nominal dollars, preserving our future value. Let's agree now before further value is lost. 
# Alice gain: 7142.86 
# Bob gain: 2857.14 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
