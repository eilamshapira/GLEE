Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2857.14, ""alice_gain"": 7142.86, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the pace of depreciation—20% for me and 10% for you in every round—I’ve structured this proposal so you get exactly what you'd expect if you waited for your turn to propose next (approximately 0.9*(1-0.8)/(1-0.72) of the total). Accepting now gives you 7,142.86 and me 2,857.14 in nominal dollars, preserving our future value. Let's agree now before further value is lost.""}"
