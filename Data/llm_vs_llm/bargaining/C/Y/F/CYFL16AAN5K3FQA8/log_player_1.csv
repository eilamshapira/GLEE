"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that Bob has the power to reject and make a counter-offer, but also taking into account that the money will be worth 10% less in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives both of us equal shares and avoids the risk of value loss due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
