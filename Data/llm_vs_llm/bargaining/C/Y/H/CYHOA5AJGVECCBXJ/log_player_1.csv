"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob loses value more quickly than I do (20% vs 5% per round). I want to be fair but also account for the time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4000 at 95% value = $3800 effective value
   * Bob gets $6000 at 80% value = $4800 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But values will decrease further (my 5%, Bob's 20%)
   * I still have negotiating leverage due to Bob's higher inflation rate

Given that Bob's money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), and that we still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer of 6000/4000, and I rejected his 4000/6000, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining my advantage due to the different inflation rates. At this point, Bob's money is worth 60% of original value (after two 20% drops), while mine is worth 90.25% (after two 5% drops).

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a more balanced offer that gives Bob a better deal than my first offer, while still recognizing my stronger position due to the inflation rates. If Bob rejects this, his next potential gains will be worth even less due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $3500 at 85.74% value = $3000.90 effective value
   * Bob gets $6500 at 51.2% value = $3328 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Values will decrease further (my additional 5%, Bob's additional 20%)
   * Bob's value loss is accelerating much faster than mine
   * The offer gives Bob more nominal money but due to his severe inflation, our effective values are already quite close

Given that Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine, and this offer would give me less effective value than him despite my stronger negotiating position, I will reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering our current situation. At this point:
1. Bob's money has lost almost 50% of its value
2. My money has lost about 15% of its value
3. Bob has rejected more balanced offers, but his negotiating position is weakening due to higher inflation

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is an even more favorable offer for Bob than my last one, while still maintaining my advantage. Given that Bob's money is rapidly losing value (his next round will be at ~40% value), this offer should be appealing to him as further delays will significantly hurt his position more than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $3000 at 77.38% value = $2,321.40 effective value
   * Bob gets $7000 at 32.77% value = $2,293.90 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * We're halfway through the rounds (6 of 12)
   * Bob's value is dropping drastically (will be below 30% next round)
   * My value is declining much more slowly

Even though Bob is offering a larger nominal amount for himself, due to his severe inflation, his effective value is actually slightly less than mine would be. However, this still gives me a worse position than I should have given my stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let's analyze the current situation:
1. Bob's money has lost ~67% of its value
2. My money has lost ~23% of its value
3. We're in round 7 of 12, so time pressure is building
4. Bob has consistently rejected fair offers despite his weakening position

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This might seem like I'm giving up ground, but consider:
* At current inflation rates, my $5000 is worth significantly more than Bob's $5000
* My $5000 at ~77% value = $3,850 effective value
* Bob's $5000 at ~33% value = $1,650 effective value
* If Bob rejects this perfectly equal nominal split, it shows he's not negotiating rationally, and his position will only worsen with further rounds

This offer appears completely fair on the surface while actually favoring me due to the inflation differences. Bob should seriously consider accepting as further delays will devastate his value even more."
