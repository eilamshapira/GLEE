"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, he has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a reasonable opening offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth 10% less in the next round, so this gives him something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $450,000 and keeps $550,000 for himself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. While my money value stays constant, Bob's money will be worth 10% less next round
4. Bob's $550,000 is already worth only $495,000 to him (due to 10% depreciation)
5. If we continue to next round, his money will be worth even less

While $450,000 is less than my initial offer, it's still a substantial amount. Given that we have 10 more rounds and Bob's value will keep decreasing, I could try to negotiate for more. However, there's also risk in prolonging negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round, as I believe I can get a better deal given Bob's time pressure from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him (due to two rounds of 10% depreciation), I'll make a strategic offer that takes this into account. Any amount Bob gets is now effectively worth only 80% of its nominal value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob than my first offer (600k/400k) but still better for me than his previous offer. This is because:
1. Bob's $450,000 is actually worth only $360,000 to him now due to inflation
2. He knows that if he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (30% depreciation)
3. This offer shows some willingness to compromise from my initial position
4. It's still better for me than his previous offer of $450,000

This offer balances my desire for a good deal with the need to reach an agreement before Bob's value depreciates too much."
