"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself. Since there's no inflation penalty for me but Alice faces 10% depreciation per round, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round when Alice's maximum potential gain will be worth less to her.

The depreciation schedule means that in the next round, $60 would only be worth $54 to Alice. This weakens her position and should make her more willing to accept a more favorable split for me.

Given this dynamic, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but not so extreme that she's likely to reject it. The money is now worth 90% of its original value to Alice, so I should account for that in my proposal.

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than her initial offer but gives me the larger share. This seems fair considering the depreciation factor, and Alice should recognize that delaying further will reduce her purchasing power.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45
2. For Alice, the $55 she's asking for is actually worth only $44.55 (81% of $55) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 4 where her money will be worth even less (29% depreciation)
4. I have no inflation penalty, so my $45 is still worth full value

While this is better than her first offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. As time passes, Alice's negotiating position weakens due to inflation. In the next round, I could propose a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice given her increasing inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 4, Alice's gains are worth 29% less than in round 1. This significantly weakens her negotiating position. 

If I propose giving her $50, it would only be worth $35.50 to her due to the 29% depreciation. Meanwhile, any amount I get maintains its full value. Given this situation, I can propose a split more in my favor while still being reasonable from Alice's perspective.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a split where I get $60 and Alice gets $40. For Alice, that $40 is actually worth $28.40 after depreciation, but waiting longer would only decrease her purchasing power further, so this should be a compelling offer for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $50, up from her previous offer of $45
2. For Alice, her $50 is actually worth only $32.80 (65.61% of $50) due to the 34.39% inflation
3. I still get full value of my $50 with no depreciation
4. If we continue to round 6, Alice's money will be worth even less

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- I get a clean $50 at full value
- Alice is already taking a significant hit on her portion due to inflation
- Further negotiations might lead to more rounds and risk reaching the 12-round limit
- Alice has shown she's willing to reject aggressive offers from me

Given these factors, I think this is a fair point to accept and end the negotiation.
