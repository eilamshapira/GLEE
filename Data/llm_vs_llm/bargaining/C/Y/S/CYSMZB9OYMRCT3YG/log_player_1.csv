"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob, keeping in mind that delays cost me more than they cost him due to our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we delay, we both lose money, but I lose more due to my higher inflation rate. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my position.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation rates, it's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer reflects a balance between our positions, considering the value decrease. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
