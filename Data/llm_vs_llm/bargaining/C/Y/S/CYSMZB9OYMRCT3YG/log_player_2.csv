"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we delay, we both lose money, but I lose more due to my higher inflation rate. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my position. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

The initial amount is $10,000. After one round, the value for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value and tries to find a mutually beneficial split.

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Given the inflation rates, it's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer reflects a balance between our positions, considering the value decrease.""}"
