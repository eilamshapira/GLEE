"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I will send my first offer to Bob. The money is worth $100, but the value decreases by 20% each round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My initial offer was rejected. Now, the money's value has decreased due to inflation. Bob's offer is on the table.

Given that the initial $100 is now worth less, I need to consider the value of the gains.

Therefore:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I will send my new offer, factoring in the continued inflation. The initial $100 has depreciated further.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
