5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 evenly – $5000 each. With the declining value for me as rounds pass, it makes sense to secure a fair division now. I hope you’ll agree to this balanced offer so we can both walk away with our share promptly.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation effect, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a good deal before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to adjust given our shared depreciation worries. However, with round 3 here, my slice has dropped to 95% of its original value and every additional round only worsens our outcomes. I propose we lock in $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This deal reflects our current positions and mitigates further losses on both sides—especially if your own inflation is similar to mine. Let's secure this agreement now before time erodes our gains even more.",Alice,3,
