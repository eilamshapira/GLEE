"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 evenly – $5000 each. With the declining value for me as rounds pass, it makes sense to secure a fair division now. I hope you’ll agree to this balanced offer so we can both walk away with our share promptly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation effect, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a good deal before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to adjust given our shared depreciation worries. However, with round 3 here, my slice has dropped to 95% of its original value and every additional round only worsens our outcomes. I propose we lock in $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This deal reflects our current positions and mitigates further losses on both sides—especially if your own inflation is similar to mine. Let's secure this agreement now before time erodes our gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800
