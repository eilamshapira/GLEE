"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is both equitable and has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, $5,000 each. This is a fair division that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. For me (Alice), $4,000 is worth full value
2. For Bob, his $6,000 is actually worth only $4,800 (20% less) in round 2
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. This offer gives me 40% of the total, which isn't ideal but not terrible
5. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes if we factor in continued inflation on Bob's side

While this isn't the 50-50 split I proposed, it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation pressure on Bob's side. I'll accept to secure a definite $4,000 rather than risk a worse outcome.
