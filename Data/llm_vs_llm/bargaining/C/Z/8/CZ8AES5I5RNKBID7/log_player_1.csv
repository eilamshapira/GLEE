This is a tough one, and feels risky, but I'm calling Bob's bluff. He's losing more to inflation than I am, so he's incentivized to make a deal. Accepting 50/50 now means I've lost a significant chunk of potential earnings due to his stalling.  I'm betting he'll be more desperate in the next round."
