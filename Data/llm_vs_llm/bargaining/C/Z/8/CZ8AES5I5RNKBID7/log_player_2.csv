Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet halfway. This is a slight improvement on my last offer and still ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4050 
# Alice gain: 5950 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her first offer. I'm willing to hold out longer to see if I can get a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4750,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a smaller increase than you to get this settled. We're running out of time, and inflation is only going to hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with the time limit and inflation, but this offer is still not acceptable.  A ""compromise"" shouldn't mean I get a worse deal than before. I need to remain firm."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Let's end this before we both lose out more to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my principles.  This offer is fair and recognizes that we're both losing out the longer this drags on. Let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is incredibly frustrating, but I'm running out of time. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge, and accepting this is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
