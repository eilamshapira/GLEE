"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the updated money value due to inflation. In round 2, $100 is now worth $95 because of the 5% inflation.

Bob's offer is:

*   Alice gain: $40 (worth 40 / 95 * 100 = 42.10% of initial value)
*   Bob gain: $60 (worth 60 / 95 * 100 = 63.15% of initial value)

My decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. The $100 is now worth less due to inflation (it's worth $90.25, but the amounts in my proposal will still add up to 100).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
