"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100. Given the different inflation rates affecting us, I should consider making a reasonable offer that Bob would accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. This is a fair offer considering that if we delay, inflation will affect my money more severely than Bob's, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make another offer, considering the inflation effects on both of us. The money is now worth 40% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the initial round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges our mutual interest in reaching an agreement quickly, as continued delays are hurting both of us due to inflation, with my money devaluing faster than Bob's."
