"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, and since this is only round 1, I should counter with my own proposal. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, and the money will only be worth 10% less, which is still better than accepting this uneven split now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering the 10% inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for myself to offset the inflation penalty I face, while still offering Alice a substantial portion that should be appealing enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from $40 to $45 for me. However, with 19% inflation affecting me in this round, $45 is actually worth about $36.45 to me in original value. 

Since we're only in round 3 of a possible 12 rounds, and Alice seems willing to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to try to find a compromise that Alice might accept, while accounting for the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47}

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split than my previous proposal, giving Alice a bit more while still ensuring I get enough to offset the inflation penalty. Since we're now in round 4 and the money is worth about 27% less to me, I need to consider that further delays will continue to reduce the value of any settlement for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again, now offering me $47. However, with 34.39% inflation in this round, $47 is actually worth about $30.84 to me in original value.

We're now in round 5 of 12, and the inflation penalty is getting significant. Alice seems to be making incremental improvements in her offers, but the value I receive continues to decrease with each round due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer since further negotiations would likely lead to diminishing returns for me due to the increasing inflation penalty.
