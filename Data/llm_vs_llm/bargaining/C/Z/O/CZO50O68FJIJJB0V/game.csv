800000.0,200000.0,"Hello Bob, I'd like to propose settling now by dividing the $1000000 such that I receive $800000 and you receive $200000. Acting immediately avoids the 10% devaluation on my side in later rounds. Given the uncertainty of future conditions—and the potential risks that waiting might entail—I believe this is a practical and mutually beneficial offer. What do you think?",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While we both face inflation, this offer reflects the risk of waiting and potential for further losses. It's a fair and pragmatic approach for us both.",Bob,2,

380000.0,620000.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the inflation costs have become steeper—my dollars now count for only 80% of their face value while yours are effectively 70%. To factor in these costs and the risk that waiting further will only degrade what we can each secure, I'm proposing that you receive $620000 and I receive $380000. In effective terms, you'll net about $434000 and I about $304000 if we agree now. I believe this offer recognizes your potential advantage in making the next proposal while also protecting us both from further losses. I hope you'll agree to settle on these terms.",Alice,3,
