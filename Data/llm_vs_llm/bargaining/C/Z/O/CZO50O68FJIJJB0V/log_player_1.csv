"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'd like to propose settling now by dividing the $1,000,000 such that I receive $800,000 and you receive $200,000. Acting immediately avoids the 10% devaluation on my side in later rounds. Given the uncertainty of future conditions—and the potential risks that waiting might entail—I believe this is a practical and mutually beneficial offer. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While we both face inflation, this offer reflects the risk of waiting and potential for further losses. It's a fair and pragmatic approach for us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 380000, ""bob_gain"": 620000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the inflation costs have become steeper—my dollars now count for only 80% of their face value while yours are effectively 70%. To factor in these costs and the risk that waiting further will only degrade what we can each secure, I'm proposing that you receive $620,000 and I receive $380,000. In effective terms, you'll net about $434,000 and I about $304,000 if we agree now. I believe this offer recognizes your potential advantage in making the next proposal while also protecting us both from further losses. I hope you'll agree to settle on these terms.""}"
