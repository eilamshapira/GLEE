"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. Accepting this offer immediately prevents further loss from inflation on my end. Let's avoid the risk of devaluation and agree today.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a fairer split would be $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This is closer to an even division and still allows us both to benefit significantly. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
