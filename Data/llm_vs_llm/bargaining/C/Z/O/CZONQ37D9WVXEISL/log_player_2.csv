"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. Accepting this offer immediately prevents further loss from inflation on my end. Let's avoid the risk of devaluation and agree today. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I believe a fairer split would be $525,000 for me and $475,000 for you. This is closer to an even division and still allows us both to benefit significantly. Let's agree on this and end the game.""
