"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $40 out of the $100 total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be reduced by 20% for me, meaning the $100 would only be worth $80 to me in the next round.

Let me evaluate: If I reject, I could propose a better split next round, but even if I got 100% of that (which Alice would likely reject), that would only be worth $80 to me. So getting $40 now is equivalent to 50% of the next round's total value to me.

This is a reasonable first offer, and considering the inflation penalty, I should accept.
