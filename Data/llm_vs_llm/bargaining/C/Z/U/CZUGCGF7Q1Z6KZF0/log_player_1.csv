"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split. I value our collaboration and believe this reflects our equal contribution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reason: While Bob's offer appears ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it detrimental for me. Accepting this offer means I lose a significant portion of the potential value compared to the first round. I need to push for a more advantageous split before inflation erodes too much of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this game. I understand your desire for an even split, but the declining value significantly impacts me. This offer still leans in your favor when considering the real value.""
