"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game early!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering a 50-50 split which is fair. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us - 20% for me and 10% for you. This means we both lose if we keep negotiating. A 50-50 split now maximizes our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 

However, considering Bob's message and the fact that a 50-50 split is indeed fair, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
