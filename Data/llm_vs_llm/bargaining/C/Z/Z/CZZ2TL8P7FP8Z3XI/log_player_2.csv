"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation rates.

If I reject, the money's value will decrease by 20% for me in the next round, making the $10,000 worth only $8,000 to me. Meanwhile, for Alice it will be worth $9,000.

Alice is offering me $4,000 now, which is 40% of the current value. If I make a counter-offer next round, I'd be dividing what's effectively $8,000 to me and $9,000 to Alice.

This doesn't seem like a fair split given that inflation hurts me more than Alice. A 60-40 split in Alice's favor means I get less than half the pot, and with the asymmetric inflation rates, I should reject and make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to consider the inflation factors carefully. Since we're now in round 2, the $10,000 is worth 20% less to me (so effectively $8,000) and 10% less to Alice (effectively $9,000).

I'll propose a fair division that accounts for this asymmetric inflation and try to convince Alice that accepting now is better than continuing to later rounds where both of us lose value.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a 50-50 split which is fair. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us - 20% for me and 10% for you. This means we both lose if we keep negotiating. A 50-50 split now maximizes our combined value.""}"
