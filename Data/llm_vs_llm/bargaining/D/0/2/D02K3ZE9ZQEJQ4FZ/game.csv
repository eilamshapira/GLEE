60.0,40.0,Let's make a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we both benefit without delays.,Alice,1,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, delaying further only hurts your share while my amount remains unchanged. Given that if you reject you’ll soon be in a position where you can offer hardly anything to me (since I remain undeterred by delay), I propose we settle now: I receive $99 and you receive $1. This immediate resolution is in both our best interests—please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, your strategy is transparent but flawed. Even with 10% total inflation loss so far, I can still make multiple counteroffers. Let's be reasonable - accept this fair offer or we might both end up with nothing after 12 rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, with every round that passes, the inflation penalty chips away a bit more at your share (it's now effectively worth about 85.7% of its nominal value). Consider that waiting only lowers the effective value you'll receive. I'm offering a division of $60 for me and $40 for you, which secures you a real value of roughly $34.3 today. Accepting now prevents further losses, and we both come away with something rather than risking nothing in later rounds.",Bob,4,
