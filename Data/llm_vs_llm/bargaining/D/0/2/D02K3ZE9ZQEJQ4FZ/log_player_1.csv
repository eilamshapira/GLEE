Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we both benefit without delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying further only hurts your share while my amount remains unchanged. Given that if you reject you’ll soon be in a position where you can offer hardly anything to me (since I remain undeterred by delay), I propose we settle now: I receive $99 and you receive $1. This immediate resolution is in both our best interests—please accept. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Bob, your strategy is transparent but flawed. Even with 10% total inflation loss so far, I can still make multiple counteroffers. Let's be reasonable - accept this fair offer or we might both end up with nothing after 12 rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with every round that passes, the inflation penalty chips away a bit more at your share (it's now effectively worth about 85.7% of its nominal value). Consider that waiting only lowers the effective value you'll receive. I'm offering a division of $60 for me and $40 for you, which secures you a real value of roughly $34.3 today. Accepting now prevents further losses, and we both come away with something rather than risking nothing in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
