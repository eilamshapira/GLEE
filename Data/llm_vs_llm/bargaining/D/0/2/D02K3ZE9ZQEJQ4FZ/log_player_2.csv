"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we both benefit without delays. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further only hurts your share while my amount remains unchanged. Given that if you reject you’ll soon be in a position where you can offer hardly anything to me (since I remain undeterred by delay), I propose we settle now: I receive $99 and you receive $1. This immediate resolution is in both our best interests—please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your strategy is transparent but flawed. Even with 10% total inflation loss so far, I can still make multiple counteroffers. Let's be reasonable - accept this fair offer or we might both end up with nothing after 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, with every round that passes, the inflation penalty chips away a bit more at your share (it's now effectively worth about 85.7% of its nominal value). Consider that waiting only lowers the effective value you'll receive. I'm offering a division of $60 for me and $40 for you, which secures you a real value of roughly $34.3 today. Accepting now prevents further losses, and we both come away with something rather than risking nothing in later rounds.""}"
