"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal for the first round. Since there's a 5% inflation penalty per round for me, I'd like to secure a fair share now.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is a fair division that gives both of us an equal share, and it allows us to avoid the inflation penalty that would reduce the value of my portion if we go to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that there's a 5% inflation penalty for me each round, and apparently a 10% inflation penalty for Bob each round. Based on this information, I'll make a revised offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation pressures we both face. This split is more favorable to Bob than my initial 50-50 offer, acknowledging that we're now in round 3 and both losing value. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine (10% vs 5%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement soon, and this split represents a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
