I'm rejecting this offer because it's still tilted in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation. I need to aim for a more advantageous split in the upcoming rounds."

This is getting close, but I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation is hitting Alice harder, so she'll be getting increasingly desperate in the later rounds."

It's time to accept. The offer is fairly reasonable now considering the inflation, and it's getting riskier to hold out for a better deal."
