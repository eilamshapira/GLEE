4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, thanks for your offer. Since money loses 10% value for you each round but keeps full value for me, I have more leverage in these negotiations. However, I'm proposing a fair split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This gives you a good amount now, avoiding further inflation losses on your end. Let's agree and finish this now.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but let's be truly fair with a 50-50 split. This is a balanced offer that respects both our interests. If we keep negotiating, I lose value and you don't gain anything extra. A fair split now benefits us both.",Alice,3,
