"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you a generous $4,500 while taking $5,500, considering I have more to lose due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. Since money loses 10% value for you each round but keeps full value for me, I have more leverage in these negotiations. However, I'm proposing a fair split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This gives you a good amount now, avoiding further inflation losses on your end. Let's agree and finish this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 10% inflation for me, $4000 is only worth $3600 to me now. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, even though it will be worth less to me. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal despite Bob's leverage point about inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but let's be truly fair with a 50-50 split. This is a balanced offer that respects both our interests. If we keep negotiating, I lose value and you don't gain anything extra. A fair split now benefits us both.""}"
