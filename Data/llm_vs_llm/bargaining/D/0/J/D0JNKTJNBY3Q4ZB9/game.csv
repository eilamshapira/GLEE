60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses 10% value each round, this is a good deal for you to accept now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering my loss due to inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Since your money is now worth about 20% less due to inflation, you should accept this offer. If we continue, your share will be worth even less to you in the next rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Even with inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 52-48 is still a better deal for you than my initial offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Your money has lost over 27% of its value now. If we continue, your share will be worth even less to you. This 30% now is worth more than a larger share in future rounds. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to split it evenly. This is my most generous offer yet, considering my losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Your money has lost 41% of its value now. This 25% offer is actually worth only about 15% to you in real value, but if we continue, any future amount will be worth even less to you. This is still better than continuing to negotiate.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
52.0,48.0,"I'm still trying to find a middle ground. Considering my losses, this is a reasonable offer. Don't push me to desperation.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
80.0,20.0,"We only have 4 rounds left, and your money has lost over 52% of its value. This 20 is worth about 10 in real value to you now, but any future amount will be worth even less. Don't risk getting nothing - this is your best option now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm running out of options, but I still think this is a fairer split than your last offer. Meet me halfway.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
85.0,15.0,"This is the second-to-last round. Your money has lost over 61% of value. This 15 is worth about 6 in real value to you, but it's better than risking getting nothing in the final round. Accept now to secure something.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
60.0,40.0,"This is my final offer. I've come full circle, back to a split similar to your first offer. If you reject this, we both get nothing. Is it really worth the risk?",Bob,12,
