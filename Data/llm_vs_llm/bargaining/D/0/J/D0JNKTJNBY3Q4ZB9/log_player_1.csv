"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses 10% value each round, this is a good deal for you to accept now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering my loss due to inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject because Bob's money loses value each round, which gives me more leverage. If we go to round 3, his 55 will be worth less to him, so he might be more willing to accept a better deal for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Since your money is now worth about 20% less due to inflation, you should accept this offer. If we continue, your share will be worth even less to you in the next rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Even with inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 52-48 is still a better deal for you than my initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Bob's position is weakening with each round due to inflation. His 52 is worth significantly less to him now, and will be worth even less next round. I can push for a better deal in the next round since time is on my side - my money maintains its value while his continues to depreciate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Your money has lost over 27% of its value now. If we continue, your share will be worth even less to you. This 30% now is worth more than a larger share in future rounds. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to split it evenly. This is my most generous offer yet, considering my losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Bob's 50 is now worth only about 30 in real value to him due to the 41% inflation. His negotiating position continues to weaken as his money loses value each round. I can push for an even better deal in the next round, as time pressure affects him much more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Your money has lost 41% of its value now. This 25% offer is actually worth only about 15% to you in real value, but if we continue, any future amount will be worth even less to you. This is still better than continuing to negotiate.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to find a middle ground. Considering my losses, this is a reasonable offer. Don't push me to desperation. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Bob's 48 is now worth less than 24 in real value to him due to the 52% inflation. We're entering the final rounds, and his position is very weak. His plea about ""desperation"" shows this. I can push for an even better deal as his money continues to rapidly lose value and we have only 4 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 80,
""bob_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""We only have 4 rounds left, and your money has lost over 52% of its value. This 20 is worth about 10 in real value to you now, but any future amount will be worth even less. Don't risk getting nothing - this is your best option now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm running out of options, but I still think this is a fairer split than your last offer. Meet me halfway. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With only 2 rounds left after this and Bob's money worth less than 39% of its original value, I can push for an even better deal. Bob's 45 is worth only about 17.4 in real value to him now. The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but Bob has more to lose at this point and should be more willing to accept a less favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""This is the second-to-last round. Your money has lost over 61% of value. This 15 is worth about 6 in real value to you, but it's better than risking getting nothing in the final round. Accept now to secure something.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I've come full circle, back to a split similar to your first offer. If you reject this, we both get nothing. Is it really worth the risk? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is the final round and I must accept to avoid both of us getting nothing. While I had stronger offers in previous rounds, 60 is still better than 0. Bob's final offer is actually quite reasonable given the circumstances, matching my initial proposal from round 1."
