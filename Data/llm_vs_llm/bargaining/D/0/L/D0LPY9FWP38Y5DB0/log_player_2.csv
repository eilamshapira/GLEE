"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's aim for a fair distribution. Considering the inflation impact, I propose a 60-40 split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   * The $100 will be worth 10% less for me ($90 total value)
   * The $100 will be worth 5% less for Alice ($95 total value)
   * I can make the next proposal

While the 60-40 split isn't ideal for me, I need to consider that waiting will reduce the total value significantly. Even if I propose a better split next round, I'll be working with a smaller effective amount due to inflation.

The current $40 is better than potentially getting $45-50 of next round's deflated value (which would effectively be worth around $40-45 of current value).
