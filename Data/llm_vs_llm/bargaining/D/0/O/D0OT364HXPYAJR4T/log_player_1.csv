"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a standard alternating‐offers analysis (similar to the Rubinstein bargaining model) where you (Alice) discount future dollars at 5% per round and Bob at 10% per round, the optimal equilibrium split when you get to move first is as follows:

• Alice’s share = (1 – Bob’s discount factor) / [1 – (Alice’s discount factor × Bob’s discount factor)]  
  = (1 – 0.90) / [1 – (0.95 × 0.90)]  
  = 0.10 / (1 – 0.855)  
  ≈ 0.10 / 0.145  
  ≈ 0.68966 (or about 68.97% of the pie)

• Bob’s share = 1 – Alice’s share  
  ≈ 0.31034 (or about 31.03% of the pie)

For a total of $1,000,000, this corresponds approximately to:
 • Alice: $689,660  
 • Bob: $310,340
