Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being very stubborn, offering me practically the same amount after two rounds.  While inflation is eating at the value of the money, it's affecting me more than her.  I need to incentivize her to take a deal.  Holding out for a slightly better offer now is unlikely to result in a significant gain later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to make it more tempting for Alice while still trying to secure a larger share.  The hope is that she sees the value in taking a decent offer now rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal later."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 310340 
# Alice gain: 689660 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game is clearly not working in my favor. Alice is sticking to her guns and offering essentially the same deal while inflation disproportionately eats into my potential gains. It's time to cut my losses and take what's offered before things get even worse."
