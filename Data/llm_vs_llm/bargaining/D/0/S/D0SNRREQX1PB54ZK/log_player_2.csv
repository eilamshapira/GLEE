"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it reasonably. This offer gives you a good portion while considering the value decrease over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, the total amount will be worth 10% less ($90 total)
4. This means my maximum potential gain in the next round would be from $90

While $40 isn't a perfectly equal split, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject and we continue negotiating, the decreasing value means we might both end up with less. Getting $40 now is better than potentially getting $45 (half of $90) in the next round.
