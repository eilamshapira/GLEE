"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair $4,000 now. Remember, if you reject, your money will be worth 20% less next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the money losing value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Due to the 20% inflation penalty for Bob, his $5000 is actually only worth $4000 to him in this round. Meanwhile, my $5000 would still be worth the full $5000.

However, if I reject and we go to round 3, Bob's money will depreciate another 20%. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round. Also, since I don't face any inflation penalty, I don't lose value by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 40% less in this round, I can leverage this to make an offer that still gives him meaningful value while maximizing my gain.

{""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Due to the 40% depreciation you're facing, this $3000 is actually worth only $1800 to you now. If you reject, it will be worth even less next round. This is your best option at this point.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the money is losing value, but I still believe a more even split is fair. Let's compromise and avoid any further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For Bob, the $4000 is actually worth only about $2048 (due to 48.8% depreciation) in this round. 
For me, the $6000 maintains its full value.

While I could reject and potentially get an even better deal in the next round (where Bob's money would be worth about 60% less), this is actually a quite favorable offer for me. If we continue, there's also a risk of both of us losing out if the negotiation drags on too long.

The $6000 offer is quite close to what I was trying to achieve in my previous proposal, and it's a good compromise.
