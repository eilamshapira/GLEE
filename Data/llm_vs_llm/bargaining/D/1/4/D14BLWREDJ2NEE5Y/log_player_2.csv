"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $100 equallyâ€”$50 each. Accepting now ensures that I don't lose value to inflation in later rounds, and I hope you see the fairness in resolving this quickly. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, accepting Alice's 50-50 split now would be a reasonable choice. If I reject and wait for the next round, my purchasing power will decrease.
