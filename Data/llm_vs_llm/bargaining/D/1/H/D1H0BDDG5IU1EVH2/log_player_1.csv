"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make an offer for the first round. Since I'm aware of the inflation factor (10% less value for me in each round), I'll propose a fair split that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you, Bob. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for the fact that if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
