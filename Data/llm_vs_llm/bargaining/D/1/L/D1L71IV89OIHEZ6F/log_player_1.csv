"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further rounds of negotiation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us feels disadvantaged, and we can avoid the risk of losing value over time due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. For me, the value is still $500,000 as I'm not affected by inflation
3. For Bob, due to 5% inflation, his $500,000 is actually worth $475,000
4. This is less than what I offered in round 1
5. If I reject, I can make another offer in the next round, but Bob's inflation will increase further
6. There's still a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given that this is a fair offer and we're early in the negotiation, I'll accept to ensure we both get a good outcome rather than risking further inflation or potential failure to reach an agreement.
