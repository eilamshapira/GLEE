"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the impact of inflation on my share, I propose a 55/45 split. This is more balanced considering the decreasing value of money for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while his share is decreasing in value, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45 in his favor, and considering the inflation affecting his share, I'll try to negotiate a better split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's adjust the split to reflect the changing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, now worth 27% less, I propose an equal split of 50/50. This is fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Bob's share is now worth 27.1% less than the original amount, and he's proposing an equal split, I think this is a reasonable offer. Accepting this proposal would give me a significant advantage in terms of the actual value of the money.
