"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 5% value loss per round for Bob while being fair enough to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, showing good faith
2. Bob should consider that if he rejects, his share will be worth 5% less next round
3. It gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous for me"
