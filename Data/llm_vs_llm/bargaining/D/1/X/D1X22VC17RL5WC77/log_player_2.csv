"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
* 4500$ now is better than 4500$ * 0.95 = 4275$ next round
* The offer is relatively fair, giving me 45% of the total

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty means I risk getting less value if negotiations drag on.
