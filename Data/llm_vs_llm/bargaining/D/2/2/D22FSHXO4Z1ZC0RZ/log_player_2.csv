"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is a very unfair split where Alice is trying to take advantage by claiming 90% is ""fair."" Since there's no inflation penalty for me and we have plenty of rounds left, I can make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I suggest a truly fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with equal shares, which is the most equitable solution.""}

Rationale (not shown to human): I'm proposing a perfectly equal split because:
1. It's genuinely fair and harder to argue against
2. Since I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to negotiate firmly
3. Starting with 50-50 gives room for negotiation if needed in future rounds
4. It sets a strong anchor point for future negotiations
5. It clearly contrasts with Alice's unfair initial offer and shows I won't be easily taken advantage of"
