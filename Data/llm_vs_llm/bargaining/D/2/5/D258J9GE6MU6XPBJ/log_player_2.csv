"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, which means she's keeping $60. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round. I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject it too, leading to further devaluation.

Given that this is the first round and I still have room to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round and just declined Alice's offer, I'm proposing a split that gives me a bit more than half. This is reasonable considering I'm losing value with each round, and it still leaves Alice with a substantial portion. This balanced approach should be acceptable to Alice while protecting my interests against the inflation effect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully. 

Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $42, but now I'm facing 36% inflation compared to the first round. This means that the $42 is actually worth $42 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $26.88 in terms of round 1 value.

In round 1, I rejected $40, which would have been worth the full $40 to me. 

If I reject this offer, inflation will increase to roughly 49% in the next round (20% more loss), making the money even less valuable to me.

Alice doesn't seem to be affected by inflation based on the information provided, so she can afford to wait more than I can.

Given the declining value and Alice's minimal improvement in her offer, I should accept this offer now before inflation erodes my value further.
