Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While this might seem like a big shift, consider the decreasing value of the money for you with each round. A quick agreement benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 60-40 split in Bob's favor is too extreme. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I'm better off making a counter-offer. I'd lose more by accepting this unbalanced split than I would from one round of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical and fair - a 50-50 split. If we continue negotiating, the declining value for me means we both lose out. This is the most equitable solution, and it's better for both of us to conclude now rather than let inflation erode the value further.""
