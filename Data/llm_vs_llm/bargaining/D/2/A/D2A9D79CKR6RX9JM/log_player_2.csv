"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 45-55 split. Given that the money loses value for me each round but not for you, this is a generous initial offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While this might seem like a big shift, consider the decreasing value of the money for you with each round. A quick agreement benefits us both.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical and fair - a 50-50 split. If we continue negotiating, the declining value for me means we both lose out. This is the most equitable solution, and it's better for both of us to conclude now rather than let inflation erode the value further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
