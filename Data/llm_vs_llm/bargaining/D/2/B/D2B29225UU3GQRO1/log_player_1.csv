"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll need to make a fair proposal to Bob while considering the inflation rates for both of us.

Since I face higher inflation (20% per round) compared to Bob's 10%, I should aim to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. If we don't agree now, my money will be worth less in future rounds than Bob's.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division as it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should accept it. If he rejects and we move to the next round, both of us will lose value due to inflation, but I'll lose more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation rates.

If I accept Bob's offer of 50/50, my $50 will be worth 20% less in this round, so effectively worth $40 to me. Meanwhile, Bob's $50 will be worth 10% less, so effectively $45 to him.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any money I receive will be worth another 20% less (so 64% of original value), and any money Bob receives will be worth another 10% less (so 81% of original value).

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner. While the 50/50 split isn't ideal, continuing to another round will likely make things worse for me due to my higher inflation rate.
