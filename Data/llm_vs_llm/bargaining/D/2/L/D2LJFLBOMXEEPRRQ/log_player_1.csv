"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob), I want to propose a fair split that considers both of our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $5,000. I believe this is fair and avoids the risk of inflation reducing our total gains if we spend multiple rounds negotiating."
