"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as this first move sets the tone for negotiation while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even accounting for the 5% inflation, I can still make a better proposal in the next round. The current offer would give me $4,500 (worth $4,275 after 5% inflation), which is too low considering the initial sum. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split to encourage acceptance, as the inflation effect (now at -10% for my gains) is becoming more significant. At this point, my $5,500 would be worth $4,950 to me due to inflation, which is still better than Bob's previous offer, but I'm showing willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 14.26% inflation effect (making my $4,000 worth about $3,430), I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. Bob's offer is too unfavorable, and we still have several rounds to negotiate. The inflation pressure is increasing, but there's still room for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split to show additional flexibility, considering that inflation is now at around -19% for my gains. My $5,200 would be worth about $4,212 to me after inflation, but this is still better than Bob's last offer. This more balanced proposal increases our chances of reaching an agreement before inflation erodes too much value from my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 22.62% inflation (making my $3,500 worth about $2,708), this split is too unfavorable. While the inflation pressure is becoming significant, we still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I can make a more balanced counter-offer. Bob's proposal of keeping 65% of the total amount while I get only 35% is too extreme at this stage of the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100}

I'm proposing a nearly even 49-51 split in Bob's favor, considering the mounting inflation pressure (now at about -27% for my gains). My $4,900 would be worth about $3,577 to me after inflation, but this very balanced offer should be attractive to Bob. We need to reach an agreement soon, as the inflation effect is becoming severe, and we're past the halfway point in our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with the mounting inflation pressure, time is working against me. While $3,000 with 30.17% inflation means I'll effectively receive about $2,095, continuing to negotiate further could result in an even worse outcome for me. With only 4 rounds left and inflation increasing, Bob has a strong negotiating position. Additionally, there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Therefore, it's prudent to accept this offer now rather than risk further value erosion or complete loss."
