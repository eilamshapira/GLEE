"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation factor here. Every round that passes makes the money less valuable to me, but not to Bob. This gives him an incentive to reject offers and make his own proposals, since delayed money doesn't lose value for him.

For my first offer, I'll propose a fair split while acknowledging this asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally. Given that inflation affects only my side, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us."
