"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for this division. Since I'm Alice and there's 20% inflation for me per round, I need to consider that the longer we negotiate, the less valuable the money becomes for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, which is slightly less than half. This is fair considering that if we go to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on whatever amount we agree to, while you won't face any inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic given the inflation pressure on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

Bob, I'm offering you $480,000, which is almost half of the total. Consider that if we continue to the next round, my position weakens due to the 20% inflation I face. This is a fair offer that gives you a significant portion while still allowing me to receive a reasonable amount given the inflation I've already incurred. Let's conclude this now so we both benefit substantially."
