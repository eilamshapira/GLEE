"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that will kick in later. To maximize my potential gain while also giving Bob enough to accept, I'll propose a slightly more generous split than I might otherwise.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and now it's my turn to decide. He's offering me $450,000, but it's worth 5% less than in round 1. Let's calculate the actual value of his offer to me:

$450,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500

If I reject this, and we go to round 3, the money will be worth even less to me. I need to consider if I think I can get a significantly better offer from Bob in a future round, taking into account the increasing inflation. While $427,500 isn't ideal, it's a decent amount to secure right now. Given the constraints and the potential for further losses, I will accept.

""decision"": ""accept""
}
