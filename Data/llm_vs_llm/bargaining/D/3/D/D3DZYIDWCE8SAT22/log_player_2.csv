"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair deal now. If we delay, inflation will hurt both of us, especially you with your 20% loss per round. This split gives you a good portion while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The $100 will be worth 20% less for me ($80 effective)
   * The $100 will be worth 10% less for Alice ($90 effective)
   * Even if I propose a better split for myself, the total value will be significantly less

3. Alice's reasoning is correct - inflation hurts me more than her

4. $45 now is better than a larger percentage of a smaller pie later

Given these factors, while the split isn't exactly 50-50, it's reasonable considering our different inflation rates, and delaying would hurt my interests more than accepting this offer.
