"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation, meaning $100 becomes worth $80 for me
3. I could counter-offer in the next round, but Alice might reject
4. The 60-40 split isn't terrible considering the inflation risk

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 40-60 split is reasonable enough considering the inflation risk. If I reject and we go back and forth even a few rounds, the total value will decrease significantly. Better to secure $40 now than risk getting less later."
