"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation penalty for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose value with each round (I lose 20% and you lose 10%), it's best we agree now. I'm offering a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face higher inflation costs. Let's avoid losing value and finalize this deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the different rates of inflation we're facing. Let's settle on this to minimize our losses and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
