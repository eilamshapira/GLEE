"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose value with each round (I lose 20% and you lose 10%), it's best we agree now. I'm offering a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face higher inflation costs. Let's avoid losing value and finalize this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
