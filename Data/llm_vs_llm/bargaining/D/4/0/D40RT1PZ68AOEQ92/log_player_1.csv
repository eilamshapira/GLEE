"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob.  Slightly more for me since I risk inflation in later rounds.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** Starting with a near-even split emphasizes fairness and might make Bob more agreeable.
* **Inflation Factor:** Alice acknowledges the inflation risk and builds in a slight advantage for herself to compensate. 
* **Early Agreement Incentive:**  By offering a reasonable deal upfront, Alice increases the chances of a quick resolution, avoiding the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, equal risk, slightly more for me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has essentially mirrored Alice's opening offer, but with the advantage now on his side.  Accepting this would put Alice at a disadvantage compared to her initial proposal. By rejecting, Alice signals she's willing to negotiate but won't accept unfavorable terms.  There's still time to reach a fairer agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle, Bob? This accounts for some inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Alice concedes slightly from her Round 1 offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Inflation Factor:**  The offer still takes into account the 5% inflation Alice experienced in Round 2.
* **Middle Ground:**  By proposing a split closer to the middle, Alice aims for a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Urgency:** With each round, the stakes increase. A slightly more generous offer might encourage Bob to settle sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still early, I'm being generous considering inflation affects you more 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer this goes on, the more Alice loses due to inflation. Waiting for a better offer is getting increasingly risky.
* **Bob's ""Generosity"":**  While Bob is trying to frame his offer as generous, it's only slightly better than Alice's previous offer after factoring in the additional inflation hit.
* **Time Pressure:** With 8 rounds remaining, there's still time for things to go wrong. Accepting a reasonable offer now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses and secures Alice a reasonable portion of the money."
