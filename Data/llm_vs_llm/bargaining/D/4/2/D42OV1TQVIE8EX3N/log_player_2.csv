Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

Even with inflation, getting 43% of the pot is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. It's not ideal, but it's the most logical choice at this point."
