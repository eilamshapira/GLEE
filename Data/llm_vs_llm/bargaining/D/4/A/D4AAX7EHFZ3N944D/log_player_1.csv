Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To avoid further delays (and the corresponding drop in value on my end), I'm proposing that you receive $7000 and I receive $3000. I believe this offers us both a timely resolution and a fair division under the circumstances. I hope you'll agree to settle now rather than risk further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
