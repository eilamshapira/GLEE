Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To avoid further delays (and the corresponding drop in value on my end), I'm proposing that you receive $7,000 and I receive $3,000. I believe this offers us both a timely resolution and a fair division under the circumstances. I hope you'll agree to settle now rather than risk further losses for both of us.""}"
