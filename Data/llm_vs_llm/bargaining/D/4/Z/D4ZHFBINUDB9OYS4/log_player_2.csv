"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll need to carefully consider this offer given the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round, but the total value will be reduced by 5%. So the $1,000,000 becomes worth $950,000 to me, and my maximum potential gain would be less.

Alice's current offer gives me $450,000, which is 45% of the total. While not an even split, it's a substantial amount, and accepting now avoids the inflation penalty.

If I reject and we go back and forth for multiple rounds, the total value keeps decreasing for me, which could leave both of us worse off.
