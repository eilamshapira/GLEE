55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher allocation for me at $55 since I face a 20% depreciation penalty each round. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, so this deal benefits us both. You get a substantial $45 share without any waiting penalty.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 20% depreciation you face. However, consider that even with that depreciation, $40 now is better than waiting another round where your $55 from the previous offer would only be worth $44 to you (after another 20% depreciation). This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your time pressure while giving me a better share.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and reasonable despite my 20% depreciation penalty. If you reject this and we go another round, my position weakens further while yours doesn't. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate and losing value. Let's conclude this equitably.",Alice,3,
