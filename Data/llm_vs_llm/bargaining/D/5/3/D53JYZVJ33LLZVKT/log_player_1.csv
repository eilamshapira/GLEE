"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher allocation for me at $55 since I face a 20% depreciation penalty each round. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, so this deal benefits us both. You get a substantial $45 share without any waiting penalty.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 20% depreciation you face. However, consider that even with that depreciation, $40 now is better than waiting another round where your $55 from the previous offer would only be worth $44 to you (after another 20% depreciation). This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your time pressure while giving me a better share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and reasonable despite my 20% depreciation penalty. If you reject this and we go another round, my position weakens further while yours doesn't. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate and losing value. Let's conclude this equitably.""}"
