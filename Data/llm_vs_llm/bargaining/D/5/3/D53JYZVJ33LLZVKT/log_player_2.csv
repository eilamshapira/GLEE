"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher allocation for me at $55 since I face a 20% depreciation penalty each round. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, so this deal benefits us both. You get a substantial $45 share without any waiting penalty. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the game's conditions. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55, justifying the uneven split based on her 20% depreciation penalty.

This is actually a reasonable argument. If I reject this offer:
- I'll get to make a counteroffer next round
- But the total value for Alice will drop by 20% (to equivalent of $80)
- While my value stays the same (no depreciation for me)

If I want Alice to eventually accept my offer, I need to consider her depreciation. Rejecting now could lead to a better deal for me in the next round, as Alice will be facing increased pressure from the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for Alice's depreciation while being more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 20% depreciation you face. However, consider that even with that depreciation, $40 now is better than waiting another round where your $55 from the previous offer would only be worth $44 to you (after another 20% depreciation). This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your time pressure while giving me a better share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and reasonable despite my 20% depreciation penalty. If you reject this and we go another round, my position weakens further while yours doesn't. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate and losing value. Let's conclude this equitably. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of a 50-50 split in light of the game dynamics.

Alice now faces a 36% depreciation compared to round 1, which puts her in a weaker negotiating position. She's offering me $50, which is better than her initial offer of $45.

If I reject:
- I'll get to make another offer next round
- Alice's money will depreciate further (to about 49% less than round 1)
- My value stays the same

While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, a 50-50 split is generally considered fair. Also, continuing to negotiate risks reaching an impasse where we both end up with less.

Given that Alice has moved from her initial position and is now offering an equal split, I'll accept.
