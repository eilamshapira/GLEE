"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the different inflation rates.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a significant amount. Hopefully, it's enough for him to accept in the first round, avoiding inflation eating into both our potential gains. I'm prioritizing a higher share for myself since I'm making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering $5,000 to each of us. Given the 5% inflation hit I've already taken, that $5,000 is worth less than it was in round 1. I need to decide if it's better to accept this, or risk further inflation in the next round if I reject.

Let's calculate the present value of Bob's offer to me:

*   Offer: $5,000
*   Inflation: 5%

Value to me: $5000 * (1 - 0.05) = $4750 if i accepted his offer in round 1.

The value of $6000 in round one, is now $6000 * (1 - 0.05) = $5700.

If I believe Bob will offer me less than $4750 (in equivalent round 1 dollars) in the next round, I should accept. Given that the inflation hits Bob harder, it's likely he will offer less next round in an attempt to compensate.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
