800000.0,200000.0,"Hi Bob, let's keep this simple and efficient. I propose $800000 for me and $200000 for you so we can both leave with a good amount. Accepting this now avoids the risk of getting less due to inflation in the next rounds. What do you think?",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I think a fairer split would be $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This way, we both get a substantial amount before the value decreases further. What do you say?",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, given the inflation and our previous offers, I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest option. We both secure an equal amount, maximizing our potential gain before the value decreases further. Let's seal the deal!",Alice,3,
