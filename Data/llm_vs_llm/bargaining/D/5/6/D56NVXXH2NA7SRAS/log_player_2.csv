"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's keep this simple and efficient. I propose $800000 for me and $200000 for you so we can both leave with a good amount. Accepting this now avoids the risk of getting less due to inflation in the next rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I think a fairer split would be $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This way, we both get a substantial amount before the value decreases further. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the inflation and our previous offers, I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest option. We both secure an equal amount, maximizing our potential gain before the value decreases further. Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
