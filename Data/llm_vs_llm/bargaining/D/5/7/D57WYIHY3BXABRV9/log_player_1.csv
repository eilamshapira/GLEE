"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. The offer is 45$ for me and 55$ for Bob
2. Due to 5% inflation, my 45$ is actually worth 42.75$
3. While the initial 60-40 split I proposed would now be worth 57$ for me (after 5% inflation)
4. There's risk in rejecting as the money will be worth even less next round

Given that the difference between what I could get now (42.75$) vs. what I proposed initially (57$ after inflation) is significant, and considering that future rounds will reduce value further, I'll reject this offer and try one more time.
