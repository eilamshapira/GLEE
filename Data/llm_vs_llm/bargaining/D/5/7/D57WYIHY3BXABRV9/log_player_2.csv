Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. Further delays will only reduce the value for both of us due to inflation. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth actually 45 * 0.64 = 28.8 (since it's 36% less than the original value).
