5500.0,4500.0,"Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation. This is a balanced offer that gives us both a good outcome.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take a slightly bigger share this round - 60/40. Consider this a counter to your previous offers. If we don't agree soon we will lose more.,Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Look, we're both losing significantly to inflation. I'm offering a reasonable 52-48 split that favors me slightly but gives you a solid $4800. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less value. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now.",Alice,5,
