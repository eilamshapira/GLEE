"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fairer split, 55-45 in my favor. It's early, and we both benefit from agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 10% inflation for me, $4500 is actually worth $4050. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation. While Bob is experiencing 20% inflation, that doesn't affect my decision as much as getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation. This is a balanced offer that gives us both a good outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take a slightly bigger share this round - 60/40. Consider this a counter to your previous offers. If we don't agree soon we will lose more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Even with 27.1% inflation affecting my share, getting $4000 would be worth only about $2916 in original value. I can still make a better counter-offer, even though inflation is increasing. Bob's share is being hit harder by inflation (48.8%), which might make him more willing to accept a reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Look, we're both losing significantly to inflation. I'm offering a reasonable 52-48 split that favors me slightly but gives you a solid $4800. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less value. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now.""}"
