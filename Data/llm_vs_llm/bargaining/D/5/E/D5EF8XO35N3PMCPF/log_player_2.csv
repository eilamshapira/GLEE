"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair and equal split of the money. Since there's no inflation for me, and we don't know your inflation rate, a 50-50 split seems like the most equitable solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, my $500,000 will be worth less in future rounds (10% less per round)
3. If I reject, my next proposal would be at 90% value
4. A fair even split is a reasonable starting point
5. Waiting for better offers could result in significant value loss for me

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round and the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, accepting a 50-50 split in the first round seems like a rational choice. The inflation risk outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for a slightly better deal.
