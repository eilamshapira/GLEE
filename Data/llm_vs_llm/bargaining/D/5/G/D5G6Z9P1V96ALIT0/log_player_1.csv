"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair 50-50 split. Since we face inflation (I lose 10% value each round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division seems fair and efficient. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think it's fair for me to get a bit more since the money loses value for me as well. Let's settle for this and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
