"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair 50-50 split. Since we face inflation (I lose 10% value each round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division seems fair and efficient. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think it's fair for me to get a bit more since the money loses value for me as well. Let's settle for this and avoid further devaluation.""}"
