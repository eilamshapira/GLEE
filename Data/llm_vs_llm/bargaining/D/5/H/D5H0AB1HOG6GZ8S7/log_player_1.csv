"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial proposal, but I believe a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. This way, we equally share the benefits and risks. Letâ€™s both walk away with an even $500000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. This is a fair proposal, and accepting now means we avoid further losses from inflation. Taking the deal now means we both get $500,000, which is better than risking further rounds where the money would be worth less."
