"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unfavorable to me, giving me only $10 while she takes $90. Given that money loses value more slowly for me (5% per round) than for Alice (20% per round), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since money devalues faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges this difference in inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money more fairly. I'll take $55, and you get $45. This is reasonable considering that waiting another round would cost you more than it costs me due to our different inflation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer has improved significantly from her first offer. She's now offering me $40 instead of $10. Let me consider this carefully:

1. If I reject this offer, the money would devalue another 5% for me (total 14.75% devaluation).
2. For Alice, her money would devalue another 20% (total 56% devaluation).
3. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round.
4. However, $40 is a substantial improvement from the initial $10 offer.

Since Alice is now offering a reasonable amount and we're already in Round 3 with some devaluation occurring, I'll accept this offer.
