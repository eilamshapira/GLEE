"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my $40 would become $38 in the next round
4. There's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice
5. I have bargaining power, but the inflation penalty makes time costly for me

While 40/60 isn't an equal split, the inflation penalty makes delaying costly. If I reject and counter-offer, Alice might reject too, and we'd both lose value. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
