"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing $60 for me and $40 for you. I think this is fair considering future rounds will devalue the total amount for me. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, delaying is more costly for you than for me. I'm proposing $55 for myself and $45 for you. This is a fair split considering your time pressure is greater than mine. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less to you due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
