"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing $60 for me and $40 for you. I think this is fair considering future rounds will devalue the total amount for me. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing $60 for herself and $40 for me.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round. Since I don't experience any inflation (money is worth 0% less for me each round), my $40 would still be worth $40 to me in future rounds. However, Alice faces 10% inflation per round, so her $60 would be worth less to her if we delay.

This gives me some negotiating leverage. If I reject, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round since Alice has more incentive to settle quickly.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for our different positions regarding inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, delaying is more costly for you than for me. I'm proposing $55 for myself and $45 for you. This is a fair split considering your time pressure is greater than mine. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less to you due to inflation.""}"
