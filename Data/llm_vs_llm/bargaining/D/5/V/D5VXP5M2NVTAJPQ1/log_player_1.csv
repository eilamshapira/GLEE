"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the dwindling value of the money due to inflation. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance in the early rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 50/50. Considering the inflation is affecting me but not him, this offer is less appealing than it seems. However, rejecting means further inflation for me, and I only have 12 rounds.

Let's calculate the value:

*   My value of $55 in round 1 is equivalent to $55.
*   My value of $50 in round 2 is equivalent to $50 * 0.8 = $40.

Since $40 is much lower than the $55 I initially proposed for myself, I'm hesitant. However, if I reject, the next round's inflation will hurt me further. I need to factor in the probability of Bob offering me even less next round. Since he started with 50/50, he might try to squeeze me further.

I will accept to lock in the 50/50 split.
