"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split it 50/50.
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $3500, but its value to me is reduced by 36% due to the two rounds that have passed. So, the effective value to me is $3500 * (1 - 0.36) = $2240.

On the other hand, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.

Given the options, I think it's better to accept this offer.
