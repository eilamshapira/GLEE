7378.56,2621.44,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7378.56 and you receive $2621.44. If you reject, you’d be in position to propose next round—but given that every round lowers your take by 20%, your best alternative would yield roughly $2621.44 in present value. I believe this division is fair given our discounting factors, so let’s agree now.",Alice,1,

7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split would be $3000 for me and $7000 for you. Considering the rapid decrease in value for me each round, I think this offer still reflects a fair compromise. Let's settle on this and end the game.",Bob,2,
