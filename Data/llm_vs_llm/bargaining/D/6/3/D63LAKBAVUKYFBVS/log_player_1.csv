"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7378.56, ""bob_gain"": 2621.44, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7,378.56 and you receive $2,621.44. If you reject, you’d be in position to propose next round—but given that every round lowers your take by 20%, your best alternative would yield roughly $2,621.44 in present value. I believe this division is fair given our discounting factors, so let’s agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split would be $3000 for me and $7000 for you. Considering the rapid decrease in value for me each round, I think this offer still reflects a fair compromise. Let's settle on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
