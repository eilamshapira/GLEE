"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7378.56 and you receive $2621.44. If you reject, you’d be in position to propose next round—but given that every round lowers your take by 20%, your best alternative would yield roughly $2621.44 in present value. I believe this division is fair given our discounting factors, so let’s agree now. 
# Bob gain: 2621.44 
# Alice gain: 7378.56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split would be $3000 for me and $7000 for you. Considering the rapid decrease in value for me each round, I think this offer still reflects a fair compromise. Let's settle on this and end the game.""
