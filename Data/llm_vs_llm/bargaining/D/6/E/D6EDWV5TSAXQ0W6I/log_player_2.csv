"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount. However, since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I'll try to negotiate for a fairer distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving a slight advantage to Alice to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

This offer is more balanced than Alice's initial proposal, moving closer to a 50-50 split while still giving Alice a small advantage. This shows I'm willing to be reasonable and fair, while also standing up for my interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting - Alice has moved closer to an equal split by matching my previous offer. This shows she's willing to negotiate and is being more reasonable. Given that:
1. We're already in round 3
2. The offer is fairly close to a 50-50 split
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. Alice has shown willingness to compromise by improving her offer

I'll accept this offer.
