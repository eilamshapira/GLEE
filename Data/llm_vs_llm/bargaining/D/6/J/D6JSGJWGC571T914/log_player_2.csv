"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which is fair. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me. So even if I get a larger percentage in the next round, it might not be optimal.

Given that a fair split now is better than risking a potentially worse outcome after inflation, I'll accept this offer.
