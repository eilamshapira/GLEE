"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering future inflation will affect us both, and we can avoid losing value through negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a 50-50 split. It's fair for both of us and ensures we share the impact of inflation evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

For me, $50 with 5% inflation is worth $47.50
For Bob, $50 with 10% inflation is worth $45

This isn't a bad offer considering:
1. If I reject, we'll lose even more value in the next round
2. It's a balanced split
3. Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes for both
