"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering inflation. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in round 2, but my money will be worth 10% less, while Alice's will be worth 5% less.

If I accept now, I get $400,000.

If I reject and propose in round 2:
- For me, the $1,000,000 is worth 10% less ($900,000)
- For Alice, the $1,000,000 is worth 5% less ($950,000)

I could propose a better split in round 2, but Alice might reject and make another offer in round 3, where inflation would reduce the value further.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
