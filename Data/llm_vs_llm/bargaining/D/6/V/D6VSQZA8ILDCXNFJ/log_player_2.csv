"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round, so her $60 would only be worth $48 in purchasing power
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal
5. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to negotiate

Based on this analysis, I'll reject this offer because I can likely get a better deal in the next round, given Alice's time pressure from inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that:
1. Alice faces 20% depreciation each round
2. She just showed she's willing to accept $60
3. Her $60 from last round would only be worth $48 to her now
4. I face no depreciation penalty

I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because Alice will realize that delaying further will cost her more due to inflation, and $40 now is worth more to her than potentially getting more in a future round when it's worth less due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice offered me $45, which is better than her initial $40 offer
2. Her $55 is now worth only $35.20 to her (64% of $55) due to compounding inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
4. She's showing willingness to negotiate up from her initial offer
5. However, I still have significant leverage because:
   - I face no inflation penalty
   - She's under more time pressure
   - We have 9 rounds left

Given these factors, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting. The inflation penalty on her side gives me stronger negotiating power for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me strategize:

1. Alice's previous offers were $60 and $55 for herself
2. Due to inflation, any money Alice gets is now worth 48.8% less than round 1
3. So if I offer her $50 now, it's only worth about $25.60 to her
4. She's shown some flexibility by increasing my share from $40 to $45
5. She's under increasing time pressure due to inflation
6. But I need to make sure the offer is good enough that she'll accept, as we don't want to risk getting nothing

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

This offer gives me a better deal while still giving Alice enough that it might be worth accepting rather than risking further depreciation of her share. Her $35 now is worth more to her than a larger amount in future rounds due to the compounding inflation effect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me $50, up from her previous offers of $40 and $45
2. Her $50 is worth only $20.48 to her (40.96% of $50) due to compounding inflation
3. She's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, moving to a 50-50 split
4. We're at round 5 of 12, so there's still time, but the risk is increasing
5. I still have strong leverage because:
   - I face no inflation penalty
   - Her money continues to devalue rapidly
   - Each round her negotiating position weakens significantly

Given that her position continues to weaken and she's showing willingness to increase my share, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting. The severe inflation penalty on her side gives me stronger negotiating power for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has shown increasing flexibility (offered me $40, $45, then $50)
2. Due to inflation, any money Alice gets is now worth 67.23% less than round 1
3. The inflation effect is becoming very severe for her
4. She's demonstrating she wants to reach an agreement
5. I need to propose something that she's likely to accept while maximizing my gain
6. We're at round 6 of 12, so we're halfway through

Given these factors, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This offer makes sense because:
- Her $30 now (worth about $9.83 to her due to inflation) is better than getting a larger amount in future rounds with even worse inflation
- The trend of our negotiations has been moving in my favor
- She should recognize that delaying further will only weaken her position more
- It's still a reasonable enough offer that she might accept to avoid further losses"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $55, continuing the upward trend from $40, $45, $50
2. Her $45 is now worth only $11.80 to her (26.21% of $45) due to severe inflation
3. We're at round 7 of 12 - time is becoming a concern
4. While my leverage is still strong (no inflation for me), we need to be mindful of:
   - The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12
   - Alice might be reaching her limit of concessions
5. Her continuing to increase my share shows she's serious about reaching a deal

However, given that:
- Her money is losing value so rapidly
- She's already shown willingness to move up significantly
- I still have 5 rounds to negotiate
- I face no inflation penalty

I will reject this offer, but we're getting closer to a point where accepting might make sense.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has steadily increased my share ($40→$45→$50→$55)
2. Due to inflation, any money Alice gets is now worth 79.03% less than round 1
3. We have 4 rounds remaining after this one
4. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant
5. Alice has shown she's rational and willing to negotiate

Given these factors, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

This offer makes sense because:
- Her $25 now (worth about $5.24 to her due to inflation) is still better than getting more later with even worse inflation
- The consistent upward trend in my share suggests this isn't too far from what she might accept
- The threat of further rounds with even worse inflation should make this more appealing
- It's not so extreme as to seem unfair given the inflation circumstances
- We need to move towards a conclusion to avoid the risk of both getting nothing"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this significant development:

1. Alice has now offered me $70 - a major increase from her previous offers
2. Her $30 would only be worth $5.03 to her (16.78% of $30) due to severe inflation
3. We're at round 9 of 12 - only 3 rounds remain
4. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real
5. Alice has made a substantial concession, showing she's very serious about reaching a deal
6. This is actually equal to what I offered two rounds ago

Given:
- The substantial improvement in my share
- The limited remaining rounds
- The risk of getting nothing
- Alice's clear willingness to make major concessions
- The fact that any further delay makes Alice's position even worse

I think this is now a good deal to accept. While I might theoretically get more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing everything is becoming too high to justify it.
