"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given the 5% inflation penalty per round, I want to make a reasonable but advantageous proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a solid majority while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will have the money worth 5% less to me
3. The offer gives Bob a significant portion ($4000) which is better than risking future rounds with diminishing value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $4500
2. Due to 5% inflation, this $4500 is actually worth $4275 to me
3. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth another 5% less
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation
4. If I reject and make a new offer of say $6000 next round, it would be worth $5700 to me after inflation

While this offer is less than I proposed initially, the inflation factor makes accepting now more attractive than risking further rounds. The difference between what I get now ($4275 effective value) and what I might get later after more inflation isn't worth the risk.
