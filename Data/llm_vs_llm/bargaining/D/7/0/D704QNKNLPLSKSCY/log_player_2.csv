"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$
2. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 20% less
4. 4000$ is less than half, but it's still a significant amount

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the risk of inflation and potential further negotiations might lead to both of us getting less. 4000$ is a reasonable offer, even though it's not a 50-50 split.
