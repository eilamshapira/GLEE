5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us. While I experience 10% inflation per round, I'm willing to accept an equal division now rather than continuing to negotiate where we both might end up with less value overall. This gives us both a substantial amount without further delay.",Bob,2,
