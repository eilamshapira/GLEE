"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I propose splitting the amount with a slight advantage for me to account for inflation. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us. While I experience 10% inflation per round, I'm willing to accept an equal division now rather than continuing to negotiate where we both might end up with less value overall. This gives us both a substantial amount without further delay. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
