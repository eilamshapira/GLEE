"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose splitting the amount with a slight advantage for me to account for inflation. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500, citing inflation as the reason for the uneven split.

If I reject and proceed to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, meaning the $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to me. My next offer would need to account for this decreased value.

Since I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round (even accounting for the 10% inflation), and Alice's justification for taking more doesn't necessarily benefit me, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of $5,000 each. This is fair for both of us. While I experience 10% inflation per round, I'm willing to accept an equal division now rather than continuing to negotiate where we both might end up with less value overall. This gives us both a substantial amount without further delay.""}"
