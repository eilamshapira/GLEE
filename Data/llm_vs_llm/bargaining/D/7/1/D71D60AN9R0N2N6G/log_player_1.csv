"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without dragging out negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor. This reflects my position as the proposer in this round, but still leaves you with a significant share. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $480,000 (worth full value)
   * Bob gets $520,000 (worth only 90% = $468,000 to him)

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * But Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation
   * This might make future negotiations more difficult
   * I also risk getting a worse offer in later rounds

The current offer gives me a substantial amount, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's side, this deal is actually quite balanced in real value. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk and time cost might not be worth it.
