"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. While not exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable first offer
3. Inflation doesn't affect me, so there's no pressure from that angle
4. However, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer
5. There's still plenty of rounds left to negotiate

I'll reject this offer to try for a more equal split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the negotiation quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but considering the inflation risk for me, I need to secure a bit more. This offer is still fair and benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice slightly improved my offer from $4,500 to $4,600
2. I now know inflation is affecting Alice's gains (19% less value for her)
3. Her $5,400 is actually worth less to her due to inflation
4. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $4,600 maintains full value
5. Given the inflation pressure on Alice, this is actually becoming a more reasonable offer
6. If I reject, the inflation will continue to affect Alice's position
7. There's a risk of getting a worse deal if negotiations continue

Given these factors, especially knowing that inflation is affecting Alice but not me, this offer is becoming more favorable. I'll accept.
