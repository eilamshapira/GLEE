"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Let me explain my proposal: I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face depreciation with each passing round (10% for me and 20% for Bob), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that I have a slight advantage in the negotiation structure due to the different depreciation rates."
