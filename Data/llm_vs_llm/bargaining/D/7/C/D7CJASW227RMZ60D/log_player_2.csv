"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer to see if it's fair. She's proposing I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000.

Since inflation affects us differently (20% for me vs 10% for Alice per round), rejecting now means the total value decreases more for me than for her. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to me but $900,000 to Alice.

With only 12 rounds available and steep inflation, it may be better to accept a reasonable offer early rather than holding out for more. The $400,000 now is better than potentially nothing if we can't reach agreement.
