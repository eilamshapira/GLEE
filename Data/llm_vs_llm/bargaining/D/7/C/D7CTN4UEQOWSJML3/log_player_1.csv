"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let me explain my reasoning for this first offer:
1. I want a favorable split since I know the money will be worth less to me in future rounds due to 10% inflation
2. A 60-40 split is assertive but not overly greedy
3. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects, while still being a reasonable offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I reject and we continue to later rounds, my gains will be worth even less
2. While I get less than my initial proposal, 45$ in round 2 (worth 40.5$ after inflation) is better than risking further devaluation
3. The split is reasonably fair, close to 50-50
4. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement would result in zero gain"
