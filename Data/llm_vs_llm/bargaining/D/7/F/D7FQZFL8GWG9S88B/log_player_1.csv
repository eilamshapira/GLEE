"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as I'm making the first move. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor since I'm taking on the risk in this round. This ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- If I accept now, I'll get 450,000 × 0.8 = 360,000 (due to 20% inflation)
- I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- While there's risk in continuing, Bob's offer gives me less than what I originally proposed for him, so I'll try to negotiate for a better deal"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, with inflation affecting us both, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you 400k to close this deal now, which is still a substantial amount. Let's not risk further devaluation of the total sum.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's be reasonable and split this 50/50 before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- If I accept now, I'll get 500,000 × 0.512 = 256,000 (due to 48.8% inflation)
- If I reject and continue, next round my gains will be worth even less
- Bob is offering a fair 50/50 split
- The inflation is significantly impacting both of us, and continuing to negotiate will only reduce our eventual gains
- Better to secure a decent amount now than risk further devaluation"
