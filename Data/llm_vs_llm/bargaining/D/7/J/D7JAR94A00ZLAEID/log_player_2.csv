Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the total amount I consider is 10,000 * 0.8 = 8,000. For Alice, it's worth 10,000 * 0.9 = 9,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original amount and split it 50-50, but taking into account the decreased value for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the loss""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 4200 * 0.64 (since it's 36% less than the original) = 2688, and the actual value Alice would get is 5800 * 0.81 (since it's 19% less than the original) = 4698.

Given this, I'll evaluate the offer.
