10000.0,0.0,"Bob, I’m offering to settle immediately. Given that every extra round cuts 20% off your money while mine remain intact, waiting would only hurt you. Accepting this now is the most rational move for both of us—let’s close this deal without delay.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on my side, but starting with an offer of 0 for me was too one-sided. Let's split it evenly at 5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can end this quickly before the value drops further for me.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer. However, by rejecting this round, I can propose a more favorable division in the next round where, due to the fact that my money is not affected by inflation, I’ll be in a better bargaining position. I’m not willing to settle on an even split when I believe a more advantageous outcome is attainable in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
9999.0,1.0,"Bob, consider this: if you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 where, due to the severe inflation on your side (only 40% value remaining), you'll be forced to offer me nearly everything to get my acceptance. Essentially, your fallback is nothing. So I'm offering you $1 in nominal terms this round—which, even though it's only $0.60 in real value for you, is strictly better than the alternative. Accept this offer and let's wrap this up quickly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I rejected your last offer because it was far too low, considering the inflation effect on my side. Now, with only 40% of the original value left for me, I'm proposing 2000 for me and 8000 for you. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's still better for me than any offer I might accept from you in the next round. Let's end this now before it gets worse for me.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your offer gives me $8000, I believe that if we continue to the next round, I can leverage the worsening inflation on your side to secure an even more favorable split. Waiting further is to my advantage, so I'm rejecting this offer.",Alice,4,reject
9700.0,300.0,"Bob, consider the harsh reality: every new round continues to erode the value of your share even further. If you reject this offer, you'll have to face an even steeper depreciation when you become the proposer in round 6. Right now, I'm offering you $300—a small nominal amount that, in real terms, is far more valuable than what you'll manage to secure after further losses. Accept this offer and spare yourself additional devaluation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Alice, the value of the money for me has dropped significantly, now worth only about 40.96% of its original value. I'm offering 1000 for me and 9000 for you. This is my last reasonable offer before the value becomes nearly negligible for me. Let's settle this now before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, while your offer gives me $9000, I my turn in the next round will allow me to claim nearly the entire amount due to the further depreciation you'll face. By rejecting now, I can propose a much more favorable division for myself. Therefore, I reject your offer.",Alice,6,reject
3880.0,6120.0,"Bob, I know you’re hoping for a better outcome if we continue. But if you reject this offer, you'll be proposing in Round 8—by then, further inflation will crush the value of your share (down to roughly 20% of its nominal value). Accepting now guarantees you a nominal 6120, which at the current inflation rate gives you an effective value just over what you could expect if you waited. This is the most rational move to preserve your value. Please accept.",Alice,7,
