"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I’m offering to settle immediately. Given that every extra round cuts 20% off your money while mine remain intact, waiting would only hurt you. Accepting this now is the most rational move for both of us—let’s close this deal without delay. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on my side, but starting with an offer of 0 for me was too one-sided. Let's split it evenly at 5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can end this quickly before the value drops further for me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4 where, due to the severe inflation on your side (only 40% value remaining), you'll be forced to offer me nearly everything to get my acceptance. Essentially, your fallback is nothing. So I'm offering you $1 in nominal terms this round—which, even though it's only $0.60 in real value for you, is strictly better than the alternative. Accept this offer and let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I rejected your last offer because it was far too low, considering the inflation effect on my side. Now, with only 40% of the original value left for me, I'm proposing 2000 for me and 8000 for you. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's still better for me than any offer I might accept from you in the next round. Let's end this now before it gets worse for me.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider the harsh reality: every new round continues to erode the value of your share even further. If you reject this offer, you'll have to face an even steeper depreciation when you become the proposer in round 6. Right now, I'm offering you $300—a small nominal amount that, in real terms, is far more valuable than what you'll manage to secure after further losses. Accept this offer and spare yourself additional devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 300 
# Alice gain: 9700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money for me has dropped significantly, now worth only about 40.96% of its original value. I'm offering 1000 for me and 9000 for you. This is my last reasonable offer before the value becomes nearly negligible for me. Let's settle this now before it's too late.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you’re hoping for a better outcome if we continue. But if you reject this offer, you'll be proposing in Round 8—by then, further inflation will crush the value of your share (down to roughly 20% of its nominal value). Accepting now guarantees you a nominal 6120, which at the current inflation rate gives you an effective value just over what you could expect if you waited. This is the most rational move to preserve your value. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 6120 
# Alice gain: 3880
