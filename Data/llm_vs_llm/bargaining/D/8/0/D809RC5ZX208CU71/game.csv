1.0,9999.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be forced to make the next proposal where, by backward induction, you end up with nothing. I'm offering you a token $1 nowâ€”it's strictly better than the alternative. Let's settle today and secure our outcomes.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, your attempt at intimidation with game theory won't work. I'm proposing a more equitable 55-45 split, which is still slightly in my favor but fairer than before.
