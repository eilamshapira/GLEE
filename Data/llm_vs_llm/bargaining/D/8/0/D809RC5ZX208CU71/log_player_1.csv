Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be forced to make the next proposal where, by backward induction, you end up with nothing. I'm offering you a token $1 nowâ€”it's strictly better than the alternative. Let's settle today and secure our outcomes.

# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

We still have many rounds left, and it's better to reach a reasonable agreement than continue this back-and-forth.""}"
