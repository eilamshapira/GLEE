"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be forced to make the next proposal where, by backward induction, you end up with nothing. I'm offering you a token $1 nowâ€”it's strictly better than the alternative. Let's settle today and secure our outcomes.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your attempt at intimidation with game theory won't work. I'm proposing a more equitable 55-45 split, which is still slightly in my favor but fairer than before. We still have many rounds left, and it's better to reach a reasonable agreement than continue this back-and-forth. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
