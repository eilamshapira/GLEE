55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 this round with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since the value of the money deteriorates with each round (20% for me and 10% for you), accepting this deal now ensures that we both secure a higher value compared to waiting. Let me know if you agree!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, let's split the $100 evenly at $50 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and it's a better deal for you considering the rapid devaluation of money on your end. Let me know if you agree!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I agree. Given the rapid devaluation—20% per round for me and 10% per round for you—splitting the $100 evenly now is a fair and practical solution. Let's finalize this deal and secure our respective shares before further rounds erode their value.",Alice,2,accept
