"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 this round with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since the value of the money deteriorates with each round (20% for me and 10% for you), accepting this deal now ensures that we both secure a higher value compared to waiting. Let me know if you agree!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the $100 evenly at $50 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and it's a better deal for you considering the rapid devaluation of money on your end. Let me know if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I agree. Given the rapid devaluation—20% per round for me and 10% per round for you—splitting the $100 evenly now is a fair and practical solution. Let's finalize this deal and secure our respective shares before further rounds erode their value.""}"
