"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 this round with $55 for me and $45 for you. Since the value of the money deteriorates with each round (20% for me and 10% for you), accepting this deal now ensures that we both secure a higher value compared to waiting. Let me know if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
