"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider both the offer and the inflation factor. With a 50-50 split, I would get $5,000. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount would be worth 5% less to me, meaning the full $10,000 would be worth $9,500 from my perspective.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, it seems reasonable to accept this offer now rather than risk a potentially worse outcome after inflation.
