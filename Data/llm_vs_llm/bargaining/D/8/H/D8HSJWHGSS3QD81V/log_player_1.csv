"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from prolonged negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that we're now in round 2, I believe this is a fair adjustment considering the time spent negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4500, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $4275 to me
   * Bob gets $5500 at full value

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * I might get a higher nominal amount, but it would be worth even less
   * Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

Given that my portion is already devalued by 5% and waiting another round would cost me another 5%, I should accept this offer rather than risk further inflation penalties.
