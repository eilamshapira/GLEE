"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Seems like a good deal to me! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn! I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable, considering the game's dynamics.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try again. I'm proposing a 50/50 split now. It's the fairest way to end this game, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $5000 * 0.9025 = $4512.50. 
Still, a 50/50 split seems fair, and I don't know how the inflation affects Alice's perception of the value.
