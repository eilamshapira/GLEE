"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and square with an equal split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a completely fair and equal division
3. It's the first round, and we have 12 rounds total
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of getting less in future rounds
5. A 50-50 split is a common and reasonable solution in such games

Given that this is a fair offer right from the start, and considering that trying to get more might lead to worse outcomes or even both of us getting nothing, I'll accept this offer.
