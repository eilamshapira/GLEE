"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the 5% inflation means the total will be worth less to me.

Let me analyze: If I reject, the $100 is worth only $95 to me in the next round. Even if I propose a 50/50 split, I'd get $47.50 (50% of $95). If Alice rejects that, and we continue, the value keeps decreasing for me.

Given this is the first round and we have a limit of 12 rounds, I'll reject this offer since I believe I can get a better deal, and the inflation hasn't impacted the amount significantly yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me. Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's more favorable to me but still reasonable for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is slightly in my favor but still fair, especially considering that if we continue to future rounds, inflation will reduce the value for me more significantly. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect carefully here. The money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1, but worth the same to Alice. This reveals that inflation only affects me, not Alice.

If I reject this offer, the next round will have about 15% inflation for me, making the $100 pot effectively worth only $85 to me. Even if I proposed a 60/40 split in my favor in the next round, I'd get $51 (60% of $85).

Alice has improved her offer from round 1 (from $40 to $45 for me), which shows she's willing to negotiate. Given the inflation penalty I face and the fact that this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances, I'll accept.
