I propose to take $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000.  This is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing we split the money more evenly this time. With the inflation, my previous offer is worth less to me, so I'm adjusting it slightly.  I think this is fair, considering Bob's offer was also adjusted due to inflation."
