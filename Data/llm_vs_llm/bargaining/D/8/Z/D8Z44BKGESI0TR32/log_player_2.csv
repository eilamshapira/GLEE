"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for herself. If I reject this offer:
- I can make a counter-proposal in the next round
- However, the money will be worth 5% less to me (so $10,000 becomes worth $9,500)
- For Alice, it will be worth 20% less (so $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 to her)

Given that Alice will lose value much faster than me (20% vs 5%), I have negotiating leverage. If I reject, I can propose a better split in the next round, and Alice will be more likely to accept since the money is devaluing faster for her.

The current offer of $4,000 is less than half, and I believe I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money has already depreciated (worth 95% to me and 80% to Alice), I should propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being acceptable to Alice.

Since Alice faces higher depreciation (20% per round), she has more incentive to accept now rather than continue negotiating. If she rejects, in the next round the money will only be worth 60% to her, while still worth 90% to me.

I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This gives me a slight majority while still being fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting rather than letting the money depreciate further for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $4,500 (a $500 increase from her first offer)
2. Due to inflation:
   - For me, the money is worth 90.25% of original value
   - For Alice, it's only worth 64% of original value
3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 85.5% to me
   - For Alice, it will drop to just 44% of original value

While $4,500 isn't ideal, considering:
1. The rapid depreciation Alice faces (20% per round vs my 5%)
2. The improvement from the initial offer
3. The fact that my purchasing power is still relatively strong
4. The risk of further negotiations leading to mutual loss

I think it's reasonable to accept this offer. The effective value gap has narrowed due to the differential inflation rates.
