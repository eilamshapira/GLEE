"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $50 for me, $50 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round value for me: $45 (10% less than $50)
   * Next round value for Alice: $47.50 (5% less than $50)
   * I would need to offer Alice more than $47.50 to get her to accept
   * This means I couldn't get more than $52.50 in the next round

The even split is actually a good offer since inflation will hurt my position more than Alice's if we continue. Any delay reduces my purchasing power more significantly than hers.
