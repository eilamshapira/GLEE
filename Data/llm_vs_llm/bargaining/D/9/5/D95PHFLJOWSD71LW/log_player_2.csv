"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my thought process:

*   **Alice's offer:** I get $400,000 and Alice gets $600,000.
*   **Inflation:** Since it's round 1, the money is worth 20% less to me if I reject. If I reject, my $400,000 becomes worth $320,000 if I accept a future offer of $400,000.
*   **Is $400,000 good enough?:** $400,000 is a substantial amount of money, and it's a good starting offer. It's better to accept this now rather than risk getting less in a future round due to inflation.
