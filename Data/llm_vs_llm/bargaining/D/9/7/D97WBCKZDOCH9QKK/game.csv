473684.0,526316.0,"Alice, I know waiting only loses us value—my share suffers by 10% each round. Assuming we both face time‐related devaluation, I’m proposing a division based on our mutual discounting (about 52.6% for me and 47.4% for you). Let’s finalize this deal now so that neither of us loses out even more. Please accept.",Bob,2,

,,"Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer and the extra share you've given me. Considering the inflation penalty I face each round, locking in 420000 (even though it's effectively worth about 81% of round-one dollars) is better than risking a further decrease. Let’s wrap this up now.",Bob,3,accept
