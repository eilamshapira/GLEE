Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know waiting only loses us value—my share suffers by 10% each round. Assuming we both face time‐related devaluation, I’m proposing a division based on our mutual discounting (about 52.6% for me and 47.4% for you). Let’s finalize this deal now so that neither of us loses out even more. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 473684 
# Bob gain: 526316
