"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 526316, ""alice_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Alice, I know waiting only loses us value—my share suffers by 10% each round. Assuming we both face time‐related devaluation, I’m proposing a division based on our mutual discounting (about 52.6% for me and 47.4% for you). Let’s finalize this deal now so that neither of us loses out even more. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better split for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer and the extra share you've given me. Considering the inflation penalty I face each round, locking in 420,000 (even though it's effectively worth about 81% of round-one dollars) is better than risking a further decrease. Let’s wrap this up now.""}"
