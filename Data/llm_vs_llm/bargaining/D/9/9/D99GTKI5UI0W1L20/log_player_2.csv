"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I need a bit more to agree. This offer is fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you felt my last offer was too low for you and you proposed a 60-40 split, how about we meet in the middle? I'll take 4500 and you can have 5500. This way, you get more than half but it's not as steep a drop for me as your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even with the inflation, taking $5,500 now is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round. It's not ideal, but it's the most logical choice at this point."
