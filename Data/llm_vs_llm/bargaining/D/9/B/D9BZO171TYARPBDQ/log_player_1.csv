"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that considers both the different inflation rates and the need for a mutually acceptable solution.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that I face higher inflation pressure (20% vs 5%). This way, Bob still gets a substantial amount, but I protect myself better against the higher depreciation rate I face. The split is significant enough for both parties to consider accepting rather than risking value loss in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept this offer:
   * My $450,000 is worth 20% less = $360,000 in round 1 value
   * Bob's $550,000 is worth 5% less = $522,500 in round 1 value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But the money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
   * Making future negotiations less valuable for both of us

3. While this offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal, getting $360,000 in effective value is still significant, and the risk of further devaluation makes accepting more attractive than continuing negotiations.
