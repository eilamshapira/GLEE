45.0,55.0,"Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm proposing a slightly better split for myself. I'm offering you $45, which is still a good portion. Remember that if you reject, we'll face another 10% inflation in the next round, making the total worth less for both of us. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away satisfied without further loss of value.",Bob,2,
