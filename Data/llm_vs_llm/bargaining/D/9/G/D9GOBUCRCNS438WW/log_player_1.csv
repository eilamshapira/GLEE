"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm proposing a slightly better split for myself. I'm offering you $45, which is still a good portion. Remember that if you reject, we'll face another 10% inflation in the next round, making the total worth less for both of us. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away satisfied without further loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
