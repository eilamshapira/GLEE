"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly! I'm offering you $40, which is a good deal. Let's avoid the risks of further rounds and potential inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll make an offer, but the total value will be 10% less due to inflation (so the total pot would effectively be worth $90 to me).

While a perfectly equal split would be $50 each, getting $40 now might be better than risking further negotiation with decreasing value. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the time value of money.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm proposing a slightly better split for myself. I'm offering you $45, which is still a good portion. Remember that if you reject, we'll face another 10% inflation in the next round, making the total worth less for both of us. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away satisfied without further loss of value.""}"
