"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I (Alice) face higher inflation pressure per round.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I face higher inflation (20%) than you (10%) in future rounds. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the higher inflation rate you're facing, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still acknowledges your higher rate of value loss but also considers the value I'm losing with each round. Let's settle this fairly before our shares diminish further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. In Round 1, my offered $600,000 was worth full value
2. In Round 2, Bob's offered $450,000 is worth 80% of original value = $360,000 effective value
3. If I reject and we go to Round 3, any amount will be worth only 64% of original value
4. Bob's offer, while lower nominally, still gives me a significant amount considering inflation

Given the rapid deterioration of value (20% per round for me), and that my next counter-offer would be worth even less to Bob (potentially leading to another rejection), I should accept this offer now rather than risk further value loss.
