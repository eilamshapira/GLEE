"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I face higher inflation (20%) than you (10%) in future rounds. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Given the higher inflation rate you're facing, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still acknowledges your higher rate of value loss but also considers the value I'm losing with each round. Let's settle this fairly before our shares diminish further.""
