"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $4,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the total amount will be worth only $8,000 in the next round
4. In that case, even if I proposed a more favorable split, my maximum gain would be less than $4,000
5. Alice's reasoning about taking initiative is debatable, but the numbers favor accepting now

Given this analysis, it's better to accept the current offer of $4,000 rather than risk getting less in subsequent rounds due to inflation.
