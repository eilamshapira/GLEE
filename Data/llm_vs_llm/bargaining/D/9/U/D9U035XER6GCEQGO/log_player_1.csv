"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be fair. I'm proposing a slight advantage for myself since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, while you may not have the same constraint. This is a reasonable offer that allows us both to walk away with significant amounts. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
