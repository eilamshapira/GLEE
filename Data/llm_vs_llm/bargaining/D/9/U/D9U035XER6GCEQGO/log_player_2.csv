"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer rationally considering the inflation effect on my potential returns.

Alice is offering me $100,000 while taking $900,000 for herself. This is only 10% of the total amount.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 20% less. However, I could potentially secure a much larger share than just 10%.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and I'm facing 20% inflation per round, it's better to negotiate for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be fair. I'm proposing a slight advantage for myself since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, while you may not have the same constraint. This is a reasonable offer that allows us both to walk away with significant amounts.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're facing a 20% inflation penalty each round, while I only face a 10% penalty. I'm proposing a fair split that considers this difference. Let's not let greed get in the way of a good outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the revealed inflation rates.

Alice has now offered me $400,000 (40% of the total) while taking $600,000 (60%) for herself. She's also revealed that she faces 10% inflation per round, while I face 20% per round.

With the current inflation, my $400,000 is worth only 64% of its original value (a 36% reduction), making it equivalent to about $256,000 of the original value.

If I reject and we continue negotiating, my money will be worth even less in future rounds. Since Alice faces lower inflation, she has less urgency to conclude the deal.

Given that Alice has significantly improved her offer from the first round (from 10% to 40% of the total), and considering our different inflation rates, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
