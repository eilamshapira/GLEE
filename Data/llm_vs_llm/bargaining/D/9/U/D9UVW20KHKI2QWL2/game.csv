510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), it's in both our interests to settle quickly. This split gives you just under half and is fair given our situation. I hope we can agree now and both walk away with substantial value.",Alice,1,
