"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I want to make a fair offer to Bob that considers our differing inflation rates:

{""alice_gain"": 510000, 
""bob_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), it's in both our interests to settle quickly. This split gives you just under half and is fair given our situation. I hope we can agree now and both walk away with substantial value.""}"
