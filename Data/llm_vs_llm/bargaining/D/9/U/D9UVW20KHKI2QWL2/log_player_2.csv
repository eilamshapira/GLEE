"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), it's in both our interests to settle quickly. This split gives you just under half and is fair given our situation. I hope we can agree now and both walk away with substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
