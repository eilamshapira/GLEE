"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but is still reasonable. I want to establish a starting point where I get a bit more, accounting for the inflation that will affect me in later rounds. I am hoping Bob will accept this to avoid the risk of losing value with each round."
