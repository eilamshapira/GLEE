"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $40, which is less than half
2. By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less
3. $40 now is better than $45 in the next round due to the 10% inflation
4. We have 12 rounds total, so there's room to negotiate, but waiting too long is risky
5. It's a reasonable first offer, though not ideal

While I could reject and counter with a higher offer, the inflation penalty makes accepting this decent offer more attractive than risking further negotiations.
