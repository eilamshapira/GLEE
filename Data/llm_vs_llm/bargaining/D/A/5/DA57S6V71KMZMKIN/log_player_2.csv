"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money after inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and this is the first round, I haven't lost any value yet. However, I need to think about future rounds.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $40 and her $60, and considering that the value of money decreases more significantly for me than for Alice, I should evaluate if negotiating further would be beneficial, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money.

However, since this is the first round and I haven't lost any value yet, and considering Alice's offer, I should decide based on the immediate gain versus the potential for a better offer in the future, which comes with the risk of decreased value due to inflation.

Given these considerations, my decision for this round is:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates, I want to maximize my gain while still making the offer attractive enough for Alice to consider accepting, given that the value of money decreases less for her.

For me, the money is worth 20% less with each round, so in this round, the $100 is effectively worth $80 for me (100 * 0.8). For Alice, it's worth 5% less, so $95 (100 * 0.95).

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of the original $100, considering the inflation impact.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, a fair start""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, considering our losses 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less, I need to calculate the effective value of Alice's offer to me.

The original $100, after two rounds of inflation for me, is worth 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64. For Alice, after two rounds, it's worth 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $90.25.

Alice's offer gives me $43 and her $57. Considering the inflation, the $43 I would get is effectively worth $43 * (100/64) = $67.19 in the original value, and the $57 Alice would get is effectively worth $57 * (100/90.25) = $63.12 in the original value.

Given this calculation and considering that the value of money continues to decrease, especially significantly for me, I should weigh the immediate gain against the potential for further negotiation, which risks even greater devaluation of the money.

My decision for this round is:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
