"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I think an equal split is the fairest way to divide the money. We both walk away with the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of an equal 50-50 split of the $100.

This is a fair offer that gives each of us an equal amount. In bargaining situations, equal splits are often seen as the default fair solution. If I reject this offer, I would need to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but Alice could then reject my offer as well.
