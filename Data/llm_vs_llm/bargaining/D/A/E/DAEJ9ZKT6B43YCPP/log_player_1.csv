Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, let's make it a bit more even, shall we? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This offer is beneficial for both of us. Let's close the deal.""
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a slightly better deal while recognizing the time constraint and the effect of inflation.  I'm hoping the message will encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the money devaluing further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is kicking in, let's make a deal that favors me before it's too late 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. While inflation is a concern, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's stop wasting time and walk away with something before inflation eats it all away.""
}
```

I'm going for a strong message with this offer.  Bob needs to understand the urgency of the situation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and holding out for more might leave us both with nothing."
