"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly 50-50. This way we both win and avoid further losses from inflation. It's the most equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
