"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this division is fair given the total amount. Letâ€™s not let inflation eat away our gains. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a highly unfair division where Alice takes 90% of the money. Now that I reject, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. Even with 10% inflation, making a more equitable offer would be better for both parties."
