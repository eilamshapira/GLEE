"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair. I'll take $550000 and you'll get $450000, considering that the reduction in value affects you more. This will ensure a win-win for both of us without losing value. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is proposing a 55-45 split in her favor, arguing it's fair due to my higher inflation rate.

If I reject:
- Next round I can make a counter-offer
- But my money will be worth 10% less (vs 5% less for Alice)
- Starting position would be 900,000 for me, 950,000 for Alice

Current offer value for me: $450,000
If I reject and propose 600k next round: $540,000 (after 10% reduction)

The current offer is not great but given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying might make things worse. Better to secure a decent amount now than risk ending up with less.
