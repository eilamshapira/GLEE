9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, as the more patient party I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9999 for myself. Accepting now avoids the 5% devaluation you’d incur if we delay. I hope you agree to settle this round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your advantage, but let's be fair. I'm offering to split the money equally. This way, we both get a fair share. If you reject this we will play again, but remember that my share is worth 5% less with every round.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but by holding out I get to propose next round without any loss on my side. I can secure almost the entire sum in round 3, while your share will only worsen due to the discount. So I'll have to reject your equal split offer.",Alice,2,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll take $500 and you get $9500. Remember, if you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4, but any money you receive then will suffer an extra 5% devaluation (bringing your effective payoff down to around $8573.75). Accepting my offer now gives you an effective value equivalent to what you'd expect later, while avoiding further discounting. Let's settle now.",Alice,3,
