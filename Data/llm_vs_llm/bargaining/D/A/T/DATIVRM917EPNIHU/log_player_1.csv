"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as the more patient party I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9,999 for myself. Accepting now avoids the 5% devaluation you’d incur if we delay. I hope you agree to settle this round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your advantage, but let's be fair. I'm offering to split the money equally. This way, we both get a fair share. If you reject this we will play again, but remember that my share is worth 5% less with every round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but by holding out I get to propose next round without any loss on my side. I can secure almost the entire sum in round 3, while your share will only worsen due to the discount. So I'll have to reject your equal split offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500, ""bob_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll take $500 and you get $9,500. Remember, if you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4, but any money you receive then will suffer an extra 5% devaluation (bringing your effective payoff down to around $8,573.75). Accepting my offer now gives you an effective value equivalent to what you'd expect later, while avoiding further discounting. Let's settle now.""}"
