"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as the more patient party I’m offering you $1 and keeping $9999 for myself. Accepting now avoids the 5% devaluation you’d incur if we delay. I hope you agree to settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your advantage, but let's be fair. I'm offering to split the money equally. This way, we both get a fair share. If you reject this we will play again, but remember that my share is worth 5% less with every round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I'll take $500 and you get $9500. Remember, if you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 4, but any money you receive then will suffer an extra 5% devaluation (bringing your effective payoff down to around $8573.75). Accepting my offer now gives you an effective value equivalent to what you'd expect later, while avoiding further discounting. Let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 9500 
# Alice gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
