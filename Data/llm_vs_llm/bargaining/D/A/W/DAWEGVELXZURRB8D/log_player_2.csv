"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 10% to $9,000
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation
4. A fair split in the first round avoids the risk of losing value
