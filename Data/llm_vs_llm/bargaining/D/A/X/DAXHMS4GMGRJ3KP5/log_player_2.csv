"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $5,000. This is a perfectly fair division of the money. I don't face any inflation costs, so the money's value won't decrease for me if I move to another round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Since this is a completely fair split and I don't lose anything by accepting now, I'll take it.
