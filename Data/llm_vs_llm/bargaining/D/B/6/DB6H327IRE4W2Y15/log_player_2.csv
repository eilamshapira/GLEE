"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. The offer gives me $4000, which is 40% of the total
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
4. 4000$ now is better than 4400$ in the next round (due to 10% inflation)
5. There's risk in prolonging negotiations as we only have 12 rounds

While 40% isn't ideal, it's a reasonable first offer, and the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive than risking a counter-offer.
