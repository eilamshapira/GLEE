I propose a 900,000$ share for myself and 100,000$ for Bob.  This ensures I get the lion's share while still offering Bob a decent amount.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm lowering my offer to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  This is still a significant amount for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's previous rejection and the ongoing inflation."
