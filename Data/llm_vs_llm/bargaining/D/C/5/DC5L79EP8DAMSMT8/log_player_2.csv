"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer to split the money equally, giving each of us $50.

While the 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, while Alice doesn't face this penalty. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%.

Given this inflation penalty that only affects me, accepting a fair split now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal in a future round when the money would be worth less to me.
