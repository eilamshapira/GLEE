6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly. I think this is a reasonable offer. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude this quickly before inflation reduces the value further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Okay, the value is dropping. I'm going to adjust a bit to reflect that.  Let's get this done!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be practical here. Due to the different inflation rates affecting us (29% for me, 46% for you), this split actually results in a more equitable real value for both of us. We should agree now before further inflation hurts us both.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6700.0,3300.0,"Okay, this is getting tense. Let's get this over with. I think this split is fair given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Look at the real values: with current inflation rates, my $6000 is worth $3336 in original value to me, while your $4000 is worth $1238 in original value to you. This is actually quite fair given our different inflation rates. We need to conclude this soon or we'll both lose significantly more value.",Bob,6,

6800.0,3200.0,Final offer. Let's end this.,Alice,7,
