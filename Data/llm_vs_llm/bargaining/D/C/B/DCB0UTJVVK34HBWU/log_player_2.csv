"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think this is a reasonable offer. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. That's not an even split. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 10% less for me then (so the total value for me would be $9,000).

Since this is the first round and I have bargaining power with many rounds left, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this uneven split and making a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that the total value has decreased to $9,000 for me due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude this quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, the value is dropping. I'm going to adjust a bit to reflect that.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The money is now worth 19% less to me, so $3,600 now is equivalent to about $2,916 in original value
2. Alice is actually offering me less than before (previously $4,000, now $3,600)
3. She's taking an even larger share for herself ($6,400)
4. If I reject, we move to round 4 where the money will be worth 29% less for me

Given that Alice knows the inflation is affecting her more severely (36% vs my 19%), yet she's still proposing an even more uneven split in her favor, this doesn't seem like a good faith negotiation.

However, with rapidly increasing inflation, I need to be careful about prolonging this too much. Still, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is now worth 29% less to me and 46% less to Alice, I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the differential inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. Due to the different inflation rates affecting us (29% for me, 46% for you), this split actually results in a more equitable real value for both of us. We should agree now before further inflation hurts us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, this is getting tense. Let's get this over with. I think this split is fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Alice is offering even less than before ($3,300 vs previous $3,600)
2. With 34.39% inflation for me, the $3,300 is worth only about $2,165 in original value
3. With 59.04% inflation for Alice, her $6,700 is worth about $2,744 in original value
4. Alice is still trying to take a larger nominal amount despite being affected by higher inflation

This offer is actually worse than her previous ones. Even considering the increasing inflation pressure, this isn't a fair proposal. If I reject, we'll move to round 6, but I still have several rounds to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that inflation is significantly affecting both of us (I'm losing 44.39% and Alice is losing 69.04%), I'll propose a split that actually creates more equal real value for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Look at the real values: with current inflation rates, my $6000 is worth $3336 in original value to me, while your $4000 is worth $1238 in original value to you. This is actually quite fair given our different inflation rates. We need to conclude this soon or we'll both lose significantly more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Final offer. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critically:

1. With 46.86% inflation for me, $3,200 is worth about $1,700 in original value
2. With 73.79% inflation for Alice, her $6,800 is worth about $1,782 in original value
3. Alice's ""final offer"" is actually giving us somewhat similar real values, even though the nominal amounts look very different
4. If I reject, inflation will continue to eat away at both our potential gains
5. We've already gone through 7 rounds, and we only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing

Given that the real values are actually quite close due to the differential inflation rates, and considering the risk of continued negotiation, this might be the time to accept.
