"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, which is 40%. If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 2, the value will be 10% less for me due to inflation. So if we settled on an even 50/50 split in Round 2, I'd get $500,000 but it would be worth only $450,000 to me because of the 10% inflation penalty.

Given that $400,000 now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that would be worth less to me after inflation, and considering we only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, I'll accept this offer.
