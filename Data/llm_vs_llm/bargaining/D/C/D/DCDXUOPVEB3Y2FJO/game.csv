60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, you're better off accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation effect.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, let's be a bit fairer. I understand the inflation pressure, how about a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is truly fair considering the inflation affects you but not me. If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose value each round while I don't. This proposal maximizes our combined outcome - if you accept now, you get $45 at only 10% inflation rather than risking further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this back and forth is pointless. We both know a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just agree to this and both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm offering a very reasonable 52-48 split. Let's be realistic about the situation - with each round, inflation reduces your money's value by 5%. We're now in round 5, so you've already lost nearly 20% of value. If we continue this standoff, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $48 now, which is better than potentially getting $50 several rounds later when it's worth much less to you. This is my final fair offer considering our situation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome here.  You're exploiting the inflation mechanism, but I'm willing to accept a deal that benefits us both equally. Let's be reasonable and end this.",Bob,6,
