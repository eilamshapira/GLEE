"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, you're better off accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation effect.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be a bit fairer. I understand the inflation pressure, how about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is truly fair considering the inflation affects you but not me. If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose value each round while I don't. This proposal maximizes our combined outcome - if you accept now, you get $45 at only 10% inflation rather than risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. We both know a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just agree to this and both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a very reasonable 52-48 split. Let's be realistic about the situation - with each round, inflation reduces your money's value by 5%. We're now in round 5, so you've already lost nearly 20% of value. If we continue this standoff, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $48 now, which is better than potentially getting $50 several rounds later when it's worth much less to you. This is my final fair offer considering our situation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome here.  You're exploiting the inflation mechanism, but I'm willing to accept a deal that benefits us both equally. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
