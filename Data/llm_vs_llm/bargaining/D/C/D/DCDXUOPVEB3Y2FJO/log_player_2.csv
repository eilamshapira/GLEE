"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, you're better off accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's be a bit fairer. I understand the inflation pressure, how about a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is truly fair considering the inflation affects you but not me. If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose value each round while I don't. This proposal maximizes our combined outcome - if you accept now, you get $45 at only 10% inflation rather than risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. We both know a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just agree to this and both walk away with a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a very reasonable 52-48 split. Let's be realistic about the situation - with each round, inflation reduces your money's value by 5%. We're now in round 5, so you've already lost nearly 20% of value. If we continue this standoff, you'll lose even more. This offer gives you $48 now, which is better than potentially getting $50 several rounds later when it's worth much less to you. This is my final fair offer considering our situation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome here.  You're exploiting the inflation mechanism, but I'm willing to accept a deal that benefits us both equally. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}"
