"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split this equally. We both face inflation pressure, and this 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. If you reject, your share will be worth less in the next round due to your 10% inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
