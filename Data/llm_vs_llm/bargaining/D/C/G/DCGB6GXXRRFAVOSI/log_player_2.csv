"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division reflects the urgency for you to reach an agreement quickly due to the higher inflation rate you face. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000 and keeping $700,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. This means if I want to get the same value in the next round, I'd need to secure $375,000 ($300,000 รท 0.8)
4. Alice's money only devalues by 10%, so she has less pressure to agree

While $300,000 is a significant amount, given that we're splitting $1,000,000, and considering I have the next move if I reject, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation pressure is concerning, but I think I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split this equally. We both face inflation pressure, and this 50-50 split is the most equitable solution. If you reject, your share will be worth less in the next round due to your 10% inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's depreciating faster for you than for me. I'm proposing a revised offer that still allows you a decent share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our ends.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Due to 36% inflation on my end, this $350,000 is effectively worth about $224,000 of original value to me
2. If I reject, the next round will have my money worth 48.8% less than original value
3. Alice has increased her offer from $300,000 to $350,000, showing some willingness to negotiate
4. If I reject and propose a better split next round, Alice's 29% inflation (next round) might make her even less likely to accept
5. The trend suggests that further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns for both of us

Given the accelerating inflation rate affecting me more severely, and the modest improvement in Alice's offer, it's becoming too risky to continue negotiating.
