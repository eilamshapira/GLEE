"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a balanced split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer. This gives Bob a fair portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and you get $45 - a fair split that respects both our interests."
