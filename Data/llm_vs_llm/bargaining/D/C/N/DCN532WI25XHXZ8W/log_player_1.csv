"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that I believe is fair considering the asymmetric depreciation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because I face much higher inflation (20% vs your 5%). If we delay, I lose value much faster than you, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. This gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as much as I value reaching an agreement, delaying further will cost you significantly more due to the steep 20% loss per round. Accepting this offer now gives you 420000, preserving more of your value than if you risk waiting until round 3. Let's settle now before the devaluation hits us both any harder. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 530000, 
""bob_gain"": 470000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the split still needs to be more favorable to me given our different inflation rates. If we both reject each other's offers, I'll lose much more value than you will. I'm being reasonable by asking for 53% - this accounts for my higher inflation rate while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further rounds of devaluation and come to an agreement now.""}"
