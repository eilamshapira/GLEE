"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because I face much higher inflation (20% vs your 5%). If we delay, I lose value much faster than you, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. This gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, as much as I value reaching an agreement, delaying further will cost you significantly more due to the steep 20% loss per round. Accepting this offer now gives you 420,000, preserving more of your value than if you risk waiting until round 3. Let's settle now before the devaluation hits us both any harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the split still needs to be more favorable to me given our different inflation rates. If we both reject each other's offers, I'll lose much more value than you will. I'm being reasonable by asking for 53% - this accounts for my higher inflation rate while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further rounds of devaluation and come to an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000
