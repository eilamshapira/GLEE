"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because each round of delay will cost me 10% in value due to inflation. If we agree now, we both walk away with a good amount. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution, and we both get a good share. No need for further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
