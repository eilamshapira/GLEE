Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, considering the adjusted value of the money:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less. Effectively, for me, the money is worth $800,000.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 10% less. Effectively, for him, the money is worth $900,000.

Considering that Bob rejected my initial offer and his offer was very unfair, I will try to get as much as I can now.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 5, considering the adjusted value of the money. We can calculate the money worth from round 1 and round 4 to assess the offer:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 48.8% less. So for me, the money is worth $512,000.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The original $1,000,000 is now worth 27.1% less. So for him, the money is worth $729,000.

Considering that Bob rejected my offers and the inflation, I should offer Bob a more attractive offer to avoid further inflation.

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
