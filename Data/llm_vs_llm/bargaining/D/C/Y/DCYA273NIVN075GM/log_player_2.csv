"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 
$40 is less than half, but if I reject, the next round will already have 20% inflation, meaning my $40 would become worth $32 effectively.

If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to even more rounds and more value loss. And if we keep going back and forth, we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.

While $40 isn't ideal, securing it now is better than risking getting less due to inflation or nothing at all.
