"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer.

First, let's calculate the impact of inflation on my perspective. My initial $1,000,000 is now worth 5% less, meaning the real value of the total pot is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $950,000.

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets $300,000
*   Bob gets $700,000

From my perspective, the offer is:

*   Alice gets $300,000 (which is less than what I offered)
*   Bob gets $700,000

Considering that I've already lost 5% of the value due to inflation, I should reject this offer as it offers me less than I asked for.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I need to make a new offer for round 3. Since I rejected Bob's offer in the previous round, it's now my turn to propose again.

Remembering the 5% inflation, the value of the money *to me* continues to decrease. The current value is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.05) = $902,500.

Knowing that I'm losing value with each round, I'll try to be a bit more generous this time while still aiming for a reasonable split, compared to my initial proposal.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in round 4, taking into account the inflation effect.

*   The initial amount was $1,000,000.
*   The inflation for Alice is 14.26% less, meaning the effective value of the $1,000,000 is now $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $857,400.

Bob's offer is:

*   Alice gets $200,000
*   Bob gets $800,000

Comparing what I would get to what the initial pot of money is worth to me now, I would be making a loss if I accept this offer. It would be better to reject it and try to negotiate for more in the next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again in round 5. The value of the money to me has further decreased due to inflation.

*   The initial amount was $1,000,000.
*   The inflation for Alice is now more than 14.26%, but I am not provided this value to calculate the exact amount. I will assume the inflation is 5% per round.
*   Round 1: $1,000,000
*   Round 2: $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000
*   Round 3: $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500
*   Round 4: $902,500 * 0.95 = $857,375
*   Round 5: $857,375 * 0.95 = $814,506.25

Knowing that the value of the money continues to diminish with each passing round, I will make a similar offer to the one in Round 3.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 180000 
# Bob gain: 820000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in round 6, considering the inflation.

*   The initial amount was $1,000,000.
*   Inflation for Alice is 22.62% less, so the effective value of $1,000,000 is now $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $773,800.

Bob's offer is:

*   Alice gets $180,000
*   Bob gets $820,000

Given my perspective, the money's value has decreased significantly. The offer of $180,000 is a small fraction of the initial value. Since the offers will only become more unfavorable in the future, I should reject this offer, and hopefully I will get a better deal in future rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, time for my offer in round 7. The inflation continues to erode the value of the money for me.

Let's calculate my money value:
*   $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.2262) * (1 - 0.05) = $735,110

Knowing that the value of the money continues to diminish with each passing round, I will make a similar offer to the one in Round 5.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 170000 
# Bob gain: 830000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break down Bob's offer in round 8:

*   Initial amount: $1,000,000
*   Alice's inflation: 30.17% loss, meaning the effective value of the money *to me* is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.3017) = $698,300

Bob's offer is:

*   Alice gets $170,000
*   Bob gets $830,000

Considering my diminished perspective on the money's value and Bob's offer, I should decline this. I would gain a small fraction of the initial amount and I should reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, here's my offer for round 9. The inflation continues to take its toll.

Let's analyze my money value:
*   $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.3017) * (1 - 0.05) = $663,385

Knowing that the value of the money continues to diminish with each passing round, I will make a similar offer to the one in Round 7.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 160000 
# Bob gain: 840000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in round 10:

*   Initial amount: $1,000,000
*   Alice's inflation: 36.98% loss, meaning the effective value of the money *to me* is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.3698) = $630,200

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets $160,000
*   Bob gets $840,000

The offer I am given is a very small fraction of the value of the total money. Given how close we are to the end of the game, I will have to accept the offer, because if I reject it, I will get nothing.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, it's round 11, and the pressure is on! We're running out of time.

Let's figure out the value of the money for me after the inflation:

*   Initial amount: $1,000,000
*   Let's estimate that the inflation keeps decreasing by 5% round by round.
*   Round 10: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.3698) = $630,200
*   Round 11: $630,200 * (1 - 0.05) = $598,690

With so little time left, I'll make a more conservative offer to maximize my chances of getting something. I'll aim for a smaller percentage for myself, hoping Bob will accept to not end up with nothing.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is the final round. Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   Initial amount: $1,000,000
*   Alice's inflation: 43.12% loss, meaning the effective value of the money *to me* is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.4312) = $568,800

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets $150,000
*   Bob gets $850,000

Considering that this is the last round and if I reject, I get nothing, even though the offer is not great, it is better than nothing. I accept the offer.
