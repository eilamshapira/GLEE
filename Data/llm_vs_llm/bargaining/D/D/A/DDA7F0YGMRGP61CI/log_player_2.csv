"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than $44.44 in the next round (because $44.44 after 10% inflation is worth $40)

While the split isn't entirely fair (40/60), accepting now guarantees me $40 in real value. If I reject, I would need to secure significantly more than $44.44 in the next round just to break even, which might be risky as Alice could reject my counter-offer.
