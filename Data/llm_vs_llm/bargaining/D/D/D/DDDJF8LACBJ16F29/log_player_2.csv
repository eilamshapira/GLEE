"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing an equal split of $500,000 each. Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), there's no financial pressure for me to accept immediately. However, there's no guarantee that rejecting and making a counter-offer would lead to a better outcome, as Alice might reject my counter-offer.

A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and I have no information suggesting I should receive more than half. Without knowing Alice's inflation rate, I can't strategically use that information either.
