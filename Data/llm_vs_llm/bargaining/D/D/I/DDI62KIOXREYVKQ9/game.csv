6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, this is reasonable. If we delay, both our shares will be worth less. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hey Alice, let's go for an even 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid further loss from inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I notice our inflation rates are different - mine is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. Since I lose value much faster, a 55-45 split is fair. This gives us both good value compared to waiting longer. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes our gains further.",Alice,3,
