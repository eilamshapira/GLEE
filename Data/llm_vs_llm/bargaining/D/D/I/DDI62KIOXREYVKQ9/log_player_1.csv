"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, this is reasonable. If we delay, both our shares will be worth less. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, let's go for an even 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid further loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I notice our inflation rates are different - mine is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. Since I lose value much faster, a 55-45 split is fair. This gives us both good value compared to waiting longer. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes our gains further.""}"
