"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, this is reasonable. If we delay, both our shares will be worth less. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hey Alice, let's go for an even 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid further loss from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice our inflation rates are different - mine is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. Since I lose value much faster, a 55-45 split is fair. This gives us both good value compared to waiting longer. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
