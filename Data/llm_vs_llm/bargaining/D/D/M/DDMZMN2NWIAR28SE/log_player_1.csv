"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2649.08, ""bob_gain"": 7350.92, ""message"": ""Dear Bob,\n\nI propose that you receive $7,350.92 and I receive $2,649.08. Here’s my reasoning in brief: If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in Round 2—but every round you wait costs you 5% in value. In the subgame‐perfect equilibrium (working backwards from Round 12), your best attainable outcome by waiting is effectively worth about $7,350.92 in today’s dollars. Accepting this offer now saves you that loss, and it avoids needless delay.\n\nI believe this proposal is strategically fair given our different discount rates and helps us wrap up the game efficiently.\n\nBest,\nAlice""}"
