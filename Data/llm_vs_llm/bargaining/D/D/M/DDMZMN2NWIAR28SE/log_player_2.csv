Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I propose that you receive $7350.92 and I receive $2649.08. Here’s my reasoning in brief: If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in Round 2—but every round you wait costs you 5% in value. In the subgame‐perfect equilibrium (working backwards from Round 12), your best attainable outcome by waiting is effectively worth about $7350.92 in today’s dollars. Accepting this offer now saves you that loss, and it avoids needless delay.

I believe this proposal is strategically fair given our different discount rates and helps us wrap up the game efficiently.

Best,
Alice 
# Bob gain: 7350.92 
# Alice gain: 2649.08
