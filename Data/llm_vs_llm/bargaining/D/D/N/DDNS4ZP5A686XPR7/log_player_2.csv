"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so the total amount I consider is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make a fair offer, considering the reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less, so if I accept Alice's offer, the $43 I gain would be equivalent to $43 * 0.81 = $34.83 in the original value.

I'll accept this offer since it's a relatively fair division, and further inflation would reduce my gain even more.
