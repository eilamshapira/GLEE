"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is a tough negotiation with the inflation factor! I need to think strategically. Since this is round 1 and I'm Alice, I should make a reasonable offer to avoid rejection and wasted rounds. I'll aim for a split that gives me a slight advantage, acknowledging the pressure on me due to inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Inflation Awareness:** I understand that waiting will cost me money due to inflation.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob has no inflation penalty, so I need to offer him enough to make it worthwhile to accept now rather than risk future offers.
*   **Starting Point:** A 55/45 split is a relatively reasonable starting point, giving me a slight edge while still providing Bob with a significant amount.
*   **Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for some negotiation in future rounds if Bob rejects it. I can adjust my offer slightly in Bob's favor in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is driving a hard bargain. A 60/40 split in his favor is quite aggressive, especially considering the inflation I'm facing. Let's calculate the actual value for me:

*   Bob's offer: $400,000
*   Inflation: 20% decrease
*   Effective value for me: $400,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $320,000

$320,000 is a significantly low amount. While the inflation is hurting me, rejecting gives me a chance to propose a better deal for myself next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, it's my turn again. Inflation is biting, so I need to be strategic but also more aggressive. Another rejection means even less value for me next round. I'll aim for a split that's more palatable to me but still reasonable enough for Bob to consider.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Inflation Impact:** The money is now worth 40% less to me than at the start ($20% per round passed)
*   **Bob's Rejection:** Bob rejected 55/45 in my favor and then offered me 40/60. I am now offering the opposite, a 60/40 split to me and a 40/60 split to him, which should be more beneficial to me due to inflation.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** I am willing to risk another round if Bob rejects this, but the cost of inflation is becoming significant. I need to get closer to a deal.
*   **Bob's Position:** Bob knows that if we reach round 12 without an agreement, we both get nothing. This gives me some leverage, as he won't want to reach that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting serious. Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and the inflation is devastating me. Let's calculate the value:

*   Bob's offer to me: $300,000
*   Inflation discount: 48.8%
*   Effective value: $300,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $300,000 * 0.512 = $153,600

$153,600 is terrible. I have to reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, time to try a different approach. Bob is clearly trying to squeeze me. I will give him a ""take it or leave it"" kind of offer. It gives me less than I initially wanted, but it's still a good chunk and better than what he's offering, especially considering the dwindling value of money for me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **The clock is ticking**: Inflation is killing my gains with each passing round.
*   **Fairness as a strategy**: Offering a 50/50 split is a universally understandable concept of fairness. Bob may be more inclined to accept this due to the perception of it being an even deal.
*   **Avoid zero**: If we reach round 12 without an agreement, we both get nothing. Therefore, the alternative to not agreeing, is to get $0. This plays into my advantage to propose this new offer.

I hope Bob is reasonable now."
