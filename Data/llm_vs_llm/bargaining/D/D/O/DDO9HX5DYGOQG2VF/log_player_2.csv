"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $450,000 while keeping $550,000 for herself. 

Given that:
1. Alice's money loses 20% value each round
2. My money keeps its value
3. We have 12 rounds maximum
4. If we don't agree, we both get nothing

Since Alice's money will be worth less each round, I have leverage to potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer. In the next round, I can propose a split that takes into account the 20% devaluation for Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, her $550,000 from the previous offer would now only be worth $440,000 to her. I can use this to propose a more favorable split for myself while still being attractive to Alice given the depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because $400,000 for Alice now is actually worth more than waiting another round where her share would lose another 20% value. This should incentivize her to accept while giving me a better deal than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (which maintains its full value)
2. She wants $600,000, but for her it's only worth $384,000 (due to 36% depreciation)
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, where her money will be worth even less (likely 48% less)
4. She's actually offering me less than in round 1, despite her money being worth less to her

This is not a good offer. Since her money continues to lose value each round, I have stronger negotiating power. I should reject this and make a counter-offer that gives me more, as time is on my side.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money is now worth 48% less to her (in the next round), I should propose a split that takes this into account. Her previous desired $600,000 would only be worth $312,000 to her in this round. I can propose a split that gives me more while still being attractive to her given the rapid depreciation of value she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This split gives me $700,000 (full value) and gives her $300,000 (which is still worth more to her now than waiting for a potentially larger sum in future rounds that would be heavily depreciated). This should be attractive to her as further delays will only decrease the value of her share more significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $500,000 (which maintains its full value)
2. She wants $500,000, but for her it's only worth $204,800 (due to 59.04% depreciation)
3. If I reject, we move to round 6, where her money will be worth even less (around 67% less)
4. This is actually a better offer than her previous ones from my perspective
5. We're already in round 5 of 12, and the value for Alice keeps decreasing rapidly

While I might get a better deal by waiting, there's also risk in pushing too hard. This is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms, and I'm getting more real value than Alice due to her depreciation. I think this is a reasonable point to accept.
