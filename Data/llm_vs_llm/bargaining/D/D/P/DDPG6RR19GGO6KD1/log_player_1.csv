"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I'm playing as Alice and there's 20% inflation for me each round, I should aim for a fair agreement early on.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us each $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests and allows us to reach an agreement in the first round, avoiding any value loss due to inflation."
