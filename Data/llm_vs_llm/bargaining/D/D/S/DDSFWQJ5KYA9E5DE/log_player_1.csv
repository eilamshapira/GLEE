"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for dividing the $10,000 in JSON format, keeping in mind the inflation impacting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm asking for a slightly larger share (60%) to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing each round. This hopefully makes it more palatable to Bob to accept now, avoiding further devaluation for me.
*   Bob still receives a significant $4000, which should be a worthwhile amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's calculate the effective value for me:

*   Bob's offer: Alice gains $5500, Bob gains $4500.
*   My inflation: Money is worth 5% less than in round 1.

Therefore, the $5500 is effectively worth $5500 * (1 - 0.05) = $5500 * 0.95 = $5225 to me.

Considering the risk of further devaluation in the next round, I will accept this offer.
