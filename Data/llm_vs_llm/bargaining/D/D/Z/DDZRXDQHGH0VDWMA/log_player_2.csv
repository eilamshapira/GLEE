"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $450,000 would effectively become worth $360,000 in the next round
5. Therefore, rejecting would mean I need to secure significantly more than $450,000 next round just to break even
6. The current offer is fairly close to a 50-50 split (45-55)

Given the significant inflation penalty and the relatively fair initial offer, I should accept.
