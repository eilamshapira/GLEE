"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a reasonable opening offer that gives both of us a good share while acknowledging my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30.86 
# Bob gain: 69.14 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unbalanced in Bob's favor. Even accounting for the 10% inflation, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering we've already lost 20% to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm reducing my initial request to show willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a fair distribution. This split, even after the 20% inflation loss, would give us both a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonably fair split, and with inflation continuing to reduce the value by 10% each round, it's better to agree now than risk further losses. Bob has moved significantly from their previous offer to a more balanced proposal."
