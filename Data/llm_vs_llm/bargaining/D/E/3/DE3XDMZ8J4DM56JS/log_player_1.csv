"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split of $50 each, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the effects of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight lead to account for potential future inflation.  We can still both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $40 would be worth $36 in real value (since it's 10% less than the original value).

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and this is the second round with inflation (20% less than the original value), I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own losses.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation hit we're both taking""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of $45 for me and $55 for Bob, hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer and avoiding further inflation losses."
