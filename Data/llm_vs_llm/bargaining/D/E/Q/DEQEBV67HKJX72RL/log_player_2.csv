"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's both take an equal share. Fair and square, 50/50 for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a fair and equal division
3. I could reject and try to get more in the next round, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice would accept a less favorable offer
   - The money doesn't lose value for me, but I don't know about Alice
   - Getting $5000 now is a solid outcome

Given that this is a fair offer and accepting it guarantees me a good amount without risk, I'll accept.
