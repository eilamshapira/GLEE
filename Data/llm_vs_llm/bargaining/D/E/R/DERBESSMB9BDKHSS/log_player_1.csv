"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing $100.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation factor - each round reduces the value of my gain by 10%, so I should adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This slightly higher amount for me helps offset the inflation effect I'm experiencing, while still offering Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
