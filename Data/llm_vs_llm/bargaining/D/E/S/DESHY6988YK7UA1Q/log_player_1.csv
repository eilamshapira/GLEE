"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Given that inflation affects my earnings by 10% each round but doesn't affect Bob's earnings, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob would likely accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer considering that if we go to the next round, any money I get will be worth 10% less to me, while your money retains its full value."
