4000.0,6000.0,"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  How about we adjust the split a bit to reflect the fact that I lose more with each round? This offer gives me a slight edge.",Bob,2,
,,"I understand your point, Bob, but I think a 60-40 split is too steep considering we started at 50-50. Let's find a more balanced solution.",Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Given the inflation rates, how about we compromise at 4500 for me and 5500 for you? This way, we both get a fair share considering the losses.",Alice,3,

3800.0,6200.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose with every round.  I'm proposing a slightly better split for me to account for the rapid devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I see your point about the devaluation, but a 3800-6200 split is still too unbalanced. Let's keep negotiating for a more equitable solution.",Alice,4,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Bob, considering the rapid devaluation for both of us, how about we settle at 4200 for me and 5800 for you? This should be fair given our current situation.",Alice,5,
