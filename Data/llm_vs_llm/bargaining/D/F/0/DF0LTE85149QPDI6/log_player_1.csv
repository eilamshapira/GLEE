Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fair negotiations. I'm offering you a generous 55%, which is much more reasonable than the previous 90-10 split. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's make this deal and avoid further devaluation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
