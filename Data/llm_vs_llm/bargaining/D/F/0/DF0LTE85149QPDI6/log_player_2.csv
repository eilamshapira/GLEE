"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering you a generous 10%. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is just 10%. If I reject, I'll have a chance to make my own proposal next round, though the money will be worth 5% less. Still, I could propose a much fairer split.

$100,000 is too low for an equal negotiation - a more equitable split would be closer to 50-50. By rejecting this, I can counter with a better offer in the next round. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I have room to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to encourage acceptance. Since we're in round 2, I need to consider that the money is worth 5% less to me, but I still want a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I believe in fair negotiations. I'm offering you a generous 55%, which is much more reasonable than the previous 90-10 split. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's make this deal and avoid further devaluation of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split it 55/45. We both get a decent sum, and we can end this now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which is actually worth $406,125 to me due to the 9.75% inflation
2. This is the same split I proposed last round, but now it's worth less to me due to inflation
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (around 15% from original value)
4. We've seen Alice is willing to negotiate and has moved significantly from her initial 90/10 offer
5. Further rounds might lead to diminishing returns due to increasing inflation

Given that Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and that waiting longer will only decrease the value for me, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
