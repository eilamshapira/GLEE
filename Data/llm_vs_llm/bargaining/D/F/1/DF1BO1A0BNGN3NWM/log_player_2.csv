"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The $100 will be worth 20% less to me (effectively $80)
   * It will be worth 90% to Alice (effectively $90)
   * I can make the next proposal
3. Given this asymmetric inflation, if I reject, I'll be negotiating over a smaller effective amount
4. A 50-50 split in the first round gives me $50, which is better than trying to get a larger share of a depreciated amount

The 50-50 split is actually a good offer considering the inflation penalty. I should take it.
