"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept early.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, Bob gets a slightly larger share, which might motivate him to accept the offer and end the game early, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
