4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, I’m offering you $5500 and taking $4500 for myself. With each passing round the money loses value for me, so it’s in both our interests to settle now. I believe this is a fair split considering the discounting effect and our mutual desire to avoid further loss. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
