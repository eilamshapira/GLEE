600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400000 which is a fair split considering time preferences. Since money loses value for you each round (20%), accepting now gives you maximum value. If we delay, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation hurting our gains.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I need to update my offer based on game dynamics. The money loses 20% value for you each round, meaning your $500000 in round 2 is only worth $400000 to you now in round 3. I'm offering you $350000 which is still substantial value considering inflation. We need to reach agreement soon or we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,3,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't accept a deal where I get less than 40% of the money.  We both need to work together to get something from this game.",Bob,4,
