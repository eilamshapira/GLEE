"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic offer to Bob, considering our different discount rates.

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400,000 which is a fair split considering time preferences. Since money loses value for you each round (20%), accepting now gives you maximum value. If we delay, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.""

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation hurting our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I need to update my offer based on game dynamics. The money loses 20% value for you each round, meaning your $500,000 in round 2 is only worth $400,000 to you now in round 3. I'm offering you $350,000 which is still substantial value considering inflation. We need to reach agreement soon or we both risk getting nothing.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't accept a deal where I get less than 40% of the money.  We both need to work together to get something from this game. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
