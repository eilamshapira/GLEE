"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400000 which is a fair split considering time preferences. Since money loses value for you each round (20%), accepting now gives you maximum value. If we delay, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to update my offer based on game dynamics. The money loses 20% value for you each round, meaning your $500000 in round 2 is only worth $400000 to you now in round 3. I'm offering you $350000 which is still substantial value considering inflation. We need to reach agreement soon or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
