"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6223.32 
# Alice gain: 3776.68 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of future rounds, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

However, since this is the first round and the money has not yet decreased in value, I'll evaluate the offer based on its face value.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $6,223.32 and her $3,776.68, I am getting more than 60% of the $10,000, which seems like a favorable split for me.

Considering the risk of inflation reducing the total amount in future rounds and the fact that I have a significant advantage in this initial offer, I decide to accept it to secure the higher value now rather than risking a potentially lower amount later.
