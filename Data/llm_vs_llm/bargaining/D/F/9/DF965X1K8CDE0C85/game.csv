5100.0,4900.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering that any delay hurts me more than you due to the 5% inflation that only affects my share. This offer gives us both close to half, and we can both walk away happy without losing value to negotiations.",Alice,1,

4900.0,5100.0,"I understand your point about inflation affecting your share, Alice. But I think we can find a solution that's fairer to both of us.  This offer gives you a bit less, but still keeps you ahead of the inflation, and I'll still be taking on a little risk with the delay. Let's see if we can make this work.",Bob,2,

5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, I had to reject your offer because inflation is already affecting my share. With each round, I lose 5% of my value while you lose nothing. I'm offering you $4750 which is still very close to half, but accounts for the fact that I've already lost value due to inflation. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for my continued losses. Let's settle this now.",Alice,3,
