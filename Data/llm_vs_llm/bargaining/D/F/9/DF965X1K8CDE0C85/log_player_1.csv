"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation factor that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, 
""bob_gain"": 4900, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering that any delay hurts me more than you due to the 5% inflation that only affects my share. This offer gives us both close to half, and we can both walk away happy without losing value to negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation affecting your share, Alice. But I think we can find a solution that's fairer to both of us.  This offer gives you a bit less, but still keeps you ahead of the inflation, and I'll still be taking on a little risk with the delay. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Bob, I had to reject your offer because inflation is already affecting my share. With each round, I lose 5% of my value while you lose nothing. I'm offering you $4,750 which is still very close to half, but accounts for the fact that I've already lost value due to inflation. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for my continued losses. Let's settle this now.""}"
