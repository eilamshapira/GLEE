"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering that any delay hurts me more than you due to the 5% inflation that only affects my share. This offer gives us both close to half, and we can both walk away happy without losing value to negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I understand your point about inflation affecting your share, Alice. But I think we can find a solution that's fairer to both of us.  This offer gives you a bit less, but still keeps you ahead of the inflation, and I'll still be taking on a little risk with the delay. Let's see if we can make this work.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I had to reject your offer because inflation is already affecting my share. With each round, I lose 5% of my value while you lose nothing. I'm offering you $4750 which is still very close to half, but accounts for the fact that I've already lost value due to inflation. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for my continued losses. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
