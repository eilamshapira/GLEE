"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become $380,000 in purchasing power next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes this a risky move. $400,000 right now is better than potentially getting slightly more that's worth less due to inflation.
