Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair! I propose I get $6000 and you get $4000. This is a generous offer given the inflation I'll face later.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation you'll face, I think a 5500-4500 split in my favor is fair. This way, you still get a significant amount despite the upcoming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
