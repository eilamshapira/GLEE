"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces steeper inflation (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early offers.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting offer that gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
For me: $45 at 95% value = $42.75
For Bob: $55 at 80% value = $44

This is not a great offer for me. Given that I know Bob faces much steeper inflation penalties (20% per round vs my 5%), I have more bargaining power in later rounds. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where the money will be worth even less to Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're in round 3:
- For me, money is worth 90% of original value
- For Bob, money is worth 60% of original value

Bob's declining utility due to higher inflation should make him more receptive to accepting a deal that favors me slightly more.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. For Bob, $35 at 60% value is $21, which is still better than risking further rounds where his money will be worth even less. For me, $65 at 90% value is $58.50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
For me: $42 at 85.74% value = $36.01
For Bob: $58 at 51.2% value = $29.70

This offer isn't great for me. Bob's money is rapidly losing value (almost 50% already), while mine is only down about 14%. With each passing round, Bob's position weakens more significantly than mine due to the higher inflation rate. I can afford to wait for a better offer or make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","At round 5:
- My money is worth about 81% of original value
- Bob's money is worth about 41% of original value

Given Bob's rapidly diminishing returns (his money has lost nearly 60% of its value), he should be more motivated to accept a deal now rather than risk further devaluation.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. For Bob, $30 at 41% value is about $12.30, which is still better than risking further rounds where his money will be worth even less. For me, $70 at 81% value is $56.70, which is reasonably good considering the inflation.

This offer puts pressure on Bob to accept, as waiting further rounds will significantly reduce his buying power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
For me: $40 at 77.38% value = $30.95
For Bob: $60 at 32.77% value = $19.66

This is a poor offer for me. Bob's money has lost over two-thirds of its value, while mine has only lost about a quarter. The difference in our inflation rates (20% vs 5%) continues to strengthen my bargaining position with each round. Bob is in an increasingly worse position to demand such a large share, as his utility is rapidly diminishing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll wait to make a more aggressive counter-offer in the next round, as Bob's deteriorating position should make him more willing to accept a deal that favors me more heavily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","At round 7:
- My money is worth about 73.5% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only about 26.2% of original value

Bob's money has lost nearly 74% of its value, while mine has only lost about 26.5%. His bargaining position is very weak now.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose I get $75 and Bob gets $25. Let's look at the actual values:
- For me: $75 × 73.5% = $55.13
- For Bob: $25 × 26.2% = $6.55

While this might seem aggressive, Bob should seriously consider accepting because:
1. His money is losing value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round)
2. If we continue several more rounds, his share will be worth almost nothing
3. We only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing
4. This is still better than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
For me: $38 at 69.83% value = $26.54
For Bob: $62 at 20.97% value = $13.00

This is a very poor offer considering the current situation. Bob's money has lost almost 80% of its value, yet he's still asking for a larger share (62%). This makes no economic sense:
1. His $62 is only worth $13 to him due to severe inflation
2. My bargaining position is much stronger as my money retains more value
3. We have 4 rounds left, and his position will only get worse
4. He's demonstrating either poor strategy or hoping I'll make a mistake

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and make a more aggressive counter-offer next round. Bob needs to understand that due to the asymmetric inflation rates, he should be accepting a smaller nominal amount now rather than holding out for a larger amount that will be worth even less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","At round 9:
- My money is worth about 66.3% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only about 16.8% of original value

Bob's money has lost over 83% of its value, while mine has only lost about 34%. His position is extremely weak now, and we only have 3 rounds left before we both get nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I propose I get $85 and Bob gets $15. Let's analyze the real values:
- For me: $85 × 66.3% = $56.36
- For Bob: $15 × 16.8% = $2.52

While this might seem very aggressive, it's actually rational because:
1. Bob's money is almost worthless now due to the 20% per round inflation
2. We only have 3 rounds left before we both get zero
3. Even a small amount now is better for Bob than a larger amount later, due to his severe inflation
4. If we reach round 12 with no agreement, we both get nothing

Bob should accept this offer as any further delays will make his position even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
For me: $35 at 63.02% value = $22.06
For Bob: $65 at 13.42% value = $8.72

This offer is completely irrational:
1. Bob's money has lost 86.58% of its value, yet he's still demanding 65%
2. His $65 is only worth $8.72 to him due to extreme inflation
3. We only have 2 rounds left before we both get nothing
4. His position will be even worse next round (money worth ~10.7% of original value)

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this poor offer. In the next round, I'll make an even more aggressive offer since we're approaching the deadline and Bob's money is becoming nearly worthless. He needs to understand that the high inflation rate on his side means he should be accepting smaller nominal amounts earlier rather than holding out for larger worthless amounts."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","At round 11 (second-to-last round):
- My money is worth about 59.9% of original value
- Bob's money is worth only about 10.7% of original value

This is the second-to-last round. If we don't reach an agreement in this round or the next, we BOTH get zero. Bob's money has lost almost 90% of its value.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose I get $90 and Bob gets $10. Let's analyze the real values:
- For me: $90 × 59.9% = $53.91
- For Bob: $10 × 10.7% = $1.07

This is a very aggressive offer, but it's completely rational because:
1. We have only one round left after this before we both get zero
2. Bob's money has lost almost 90% of its value
3. Even a small amount now is better than a larger amount next round
4. Bob's alternative is either:
   - Accept this offer and get something
   - Make a final offer next round (where his money will be worth only ~8.6% of original value)
   - Get nothing if we don't agree by round 12

Bob should accept this offer as it's better than risking getting nothing, and any money he gets next round will be worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this final round offer:
For me: $30 at 56.88% value = $17.06
For Bob: $70 at 8.59% value = $6.01

This is the final round - if I reject, we both get zero. However, Bob's offer is still highly irrational: he's demanding 70% of the nominal amount even though it's worth only $6.01 to him due to the extreme inflation he faces.

However, since this is the final round, I have to compare my options:
1. Accept and get $17.06 in real value
2. Reject and get $0

Even though this is a poor offer, something is better than nothing.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because it's better than both of us getting zero, but Bob has played this game very poorly by not understanding how the asymmetric inflation rates should have influenced his decisions in earlier rounds."
