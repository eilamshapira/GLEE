"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable split considering that waiting will hurt Bob more than me due to the higher inflation rate he faces. If he rejects this offer, his money will be worth 20% less in the next round, while mine will only lose 5% value."
