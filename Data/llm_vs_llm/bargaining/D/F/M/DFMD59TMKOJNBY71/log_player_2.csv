"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer carefully.

Currently being offered $400,000 out of $1,000,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me
- Only 5% less to Alice
- This significant difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds

While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying might leave me worse off. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 next round, while Alice's portion would only drop to $570,000.
