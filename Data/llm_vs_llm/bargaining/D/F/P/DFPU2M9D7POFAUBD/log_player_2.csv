"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's get this done quickly. I propose we split the $100 as 60/40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 60/40 split, I (Bob) would get $40. If I reject and wait for the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so my next proposal would need to be significantly better to make up for this loss.

$40 right now is better than potentially getting $50 in the next round (which would only be worth $40 to me due to inflation). Also, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable split in the next round.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
