"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. However, I should keep in mind that if I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of the money by 20% for me and 10% for Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value would be:
- Worth $800,000 to me (20% less)
- Worth $900,000 to Alice (10% less)

Since I would be making the proposal next round, I could potentially get a better deal than 50-50, but I'd be working with a reduced total value.

A 50-50 split of $1,000,000 gives me $500,000 now, which is quite substantial. If I reject, even if I propose a 60-40 split next round, I'd get 60% of $800,000 = $480,000, which is less than the current offer.
