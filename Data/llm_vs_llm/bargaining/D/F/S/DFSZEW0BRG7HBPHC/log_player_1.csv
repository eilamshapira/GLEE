"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 95,
""bob_gain"": 5
}
```

My reasoning is that this is the first round, and I want to start with an offer that heavily favors me, but isn't so outrageous that Bob will immediately reject it. I am prioritizing securing a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

My reasoning: While 50/50 seems fair, I have 10 rounds left to make a better deal considering inflation is only affecting Bob for now. I'll aim for a more favorable split in the next round when it's my turn to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 80,
""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

My reasoning: I'm still trying to secure a larger portion, but recognizing that Bob rejected a 50/50 split, I'm increasing his share significantly from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still prioritizing my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

My reasoning: While Bob is starting to feel the effects of inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 8 rounds left, and the inflation pressure on Bob will only increase. 55/45 is not enough of an incentive to accept at this stage. I'll aim for a better split when it's my turn again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

My reasoning: I'm continuing to offer Bob a larger share than my initial offer, acknowledging the increasing pressure of inflation on his side. I'm hoping this offer of 70/30 will be tempting enough for him to accept, as it's a significant improvement over my first offer, and I still get a good portion of the money. I'm also aware we're approaching the halfway point, so a compromise is increasingly important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

My reasoning: Inflation is definitely hitting Bob harder now. While 58/42 is a slight improvement, I still think I can leverage the inflation dynamic to get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to 65/35 or even 60/40 in the next few rounds. It's worth the risk to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

My reasoning: I'm continuing to move towards a more balanced split, recognizing that we are now past the halfway point. The inflation is increasingly impacting Bob's potential gains, and I want to present an offer that is attractive enough for him to accept, while still securing a majority for myself. This offer of 65/35 feels like a reasonable compromise at this stage of the game. I am hoping Bob will accept it before the impact of inflation becomes too severe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

My reasoning: With only 4 rounds left and Bob's money worth significantly less due to inflation, 60/40 is a reasonable offer. Pushing for more at this stage could risk both of us getting nothing. Securing $60 now is better than potentially getting nothing later. The inflation penalty is now quite significant for Bob, and I don't want to push him too far and risk losing the deal altogether."
