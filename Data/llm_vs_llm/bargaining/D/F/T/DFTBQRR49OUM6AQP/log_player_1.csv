"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us each round. I want to make a fair offer that Bob will accept to avoid further losses due to inflation.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I am offering Bob $4500, which is a significant amount. I am hoping this will entice him to accept it in the first round to avoid any losses due to inflation. I am keeping slightly more for myself, $5500, but hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting a guaranteed $4500 now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has made an offer. Let's analyze it carefully:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4800, Bob gets $5200.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less. Bob's money is worth 10% less.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me: $4800 * (1 - 0.05) = $4560.

If I reject and move to round 3, my money will be worth another 5% less, so my money will be worth 10% less than in the first round. Bob will be in the same situation.

I'll accept this offer.
