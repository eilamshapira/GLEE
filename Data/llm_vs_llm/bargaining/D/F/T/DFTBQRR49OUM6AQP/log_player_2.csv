"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $10,000 and adjust my share accordingly.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800}"
