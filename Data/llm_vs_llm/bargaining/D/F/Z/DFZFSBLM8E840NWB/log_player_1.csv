"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's adjust for inflation, 55 for me and 45 for you is fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $45, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $45 * 0.9 = $40.5.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value for me was 90%, and for Bob, it was 95%.
Now, in Round 3, the value for me is 90% * 0.9 = 81%, and for Bob, it's 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%.

Considering this, I'll make an offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, don't let inflation eat away our money""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation in mind for both of us, let's split it 53 for me and 47 for you. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering inflation.

For me, the money is worth 81% * 0.9 = 72.9% of the original value (from Round 3 to Round 4).
So, if I accept this offer, I'll get $47, but it's worth $47 * 0.729 = $34.23.

For Bob, the money is worth 90.25% * 0.95 = 85.74% of the original value (from Round 3 to Round 4).
So, Bob will get $53, which is worth $53 * 0.8574 = $45.42.

Considering the significant decrease in value for me, I think I should accept this offer to minimize further losses.
