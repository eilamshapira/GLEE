"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But due to 5% inflation, if I reject, any amount I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject and propose say 6000 for me next round, it would actually be worth 5700 due to inflation
5. There's also a risk Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given this analysis, a guaranteed 5000 now is better than risking inflation and potential rejection for a marginally better deal.
