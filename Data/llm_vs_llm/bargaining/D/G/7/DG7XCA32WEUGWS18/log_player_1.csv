"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but also considers the inflation effect I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in later rounds. If we can agree now, we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further inflation."
