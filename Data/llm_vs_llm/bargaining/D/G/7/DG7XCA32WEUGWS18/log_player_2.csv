"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500. With 20% inflation per round for me, if I reject this and we continue negotiating, the total value will decrease for me. If I counter-offer in round 2, the $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Given that:
1. This is a reasonable first offer (45% for me)
2. The inflation penalty is significant
3. We have limited rounds, but many opportunities for the deal to fail
4. Getting something is better than risking getting nothing
