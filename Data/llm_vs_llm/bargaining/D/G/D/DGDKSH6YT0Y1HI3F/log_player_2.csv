Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about I take 55 and you take 45? This is closer to what you proposed, but still gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
