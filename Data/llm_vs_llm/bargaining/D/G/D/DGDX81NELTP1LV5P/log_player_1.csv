"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation affecting my gains while Bob's remain constant. Here's my offer for round 1, aiming for a slightly larger share considering my disadvantage in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** $40 for me, $60 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 10% less. So, the $40 is effectively worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 in round 1 terms.

Considering the inflation, this isn't a great offer. I'll reject and hope to get a better offer next round when I'm making the proposal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 3. My money is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less than round 2). I need to keep that in mind. To compensate, I need to offer Bob a bit more to ensure he accepts, but still try to grab as much as I can.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break down Bob's offer and my situation:

*   **Bob's offer:** $45 for me, $55 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 27.1% less. Therefore, $45 is effectively worth $45 * (1 - 0.271) = $45 * 0.729 = $32.805 in round 1 terms.

This is getting pretty bad. The effective value of the money I'd receive is dropping significantly. While I'd prefer more, I need to consider that rejecting this could lead to an even worse outcome if I'm forced to offer Bob even more in the next round due to my continuing inflation disadvantage. I'll accept this to salvage something.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
