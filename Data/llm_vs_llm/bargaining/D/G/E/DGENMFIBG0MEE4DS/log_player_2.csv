"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. Alice faces 20% inflation, so she's under more pressure to reach a deal

The offer isn't terrible at 45% of the total, and given that I face 5% inflation per round, getting $4,500 now is better than potentially getting a bit more in future rounds after inflation.
