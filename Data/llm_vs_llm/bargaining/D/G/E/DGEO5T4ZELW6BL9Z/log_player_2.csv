"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a pretty fair offer from Alice - almost a 50-50 split. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, I need to consider:

1. The 5% inflation penalty per round means my $49 would be worth less if I wait
2. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
3. The risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds

Given these factors, a nearly equal split in the first round is quite reasonable.
