"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for the division of $1,000,000. Since we both lose value with each passing round (me at 5% and Bob at 10%), I should propose a fair split that considers these different discount rates.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself, but this is still an excellent deal for Bob. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for Bob. At Bob's 10% discount rate, delaying would cost him more than accepting this reasonable offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

Bob is offering me $525,000, which after the 5% inflation in this round is equivalent to $525,000 Ã— 0.95 = $498,750 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, the total pot will face another round of inflation, and I'll need to make a new offer. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), I do have some negotiating leverage.

However, the current offer gives me a reasonable share, and the diminishing returns from further negotiations might not be worth the risk. Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation effects, and I'm getting more than half of the total amount.
