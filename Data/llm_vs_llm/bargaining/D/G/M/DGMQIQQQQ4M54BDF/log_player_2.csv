"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully given the inflation risk.

Alice is offering me $1,000 out of $10,000, which is only 10% of the total. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me).

This seems quite unfair, as Alice is taking 90% of the pot. Even with inflation, I should be able to secure a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a more balanced proposal. I need to consider that the money is already worth 20% less to me in this round, and if Alice rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth even less to me.

I'll propose a fair division that gives Alice a good incentive to accept while ensuring I get a reasonable share.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both a significant amount. Since Alice only offered me 10% in the first round, this represents a much better deal for me while still being equitable for Alice."
