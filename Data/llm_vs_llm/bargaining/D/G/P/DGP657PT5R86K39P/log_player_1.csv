"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split.  We can adjust in later rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
This is a good offer to accept because:
1. The money is already worth less due to inflation (I would only get 450,000 in effective value due to 10% inflation)
2. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation
3. A 50-50 split is fair, and getting a significantly better deal would be difficult
4. Bob could retaliate with worse offers if I reject this reasonable one
5. Early agreement maximizes value for both parties"
