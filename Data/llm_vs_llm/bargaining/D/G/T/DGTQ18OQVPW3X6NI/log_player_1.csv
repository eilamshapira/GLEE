"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of $1,000,000 where I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. Since my share loses 20% of its value with every round we delay, I believe settling now is our best mutual interest. Letâ€™s agree and avoid unnecessary devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about devaluation. However, I think a fair split would be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's settle for an equal division of $500000 each. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
