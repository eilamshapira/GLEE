"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of $1000000 where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. Since my share loses 20% of its value with every round we delay, I believe settling now is our best mutual interest. Letâ€™s agree and avoid unnecessary devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
