"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more since the money is worth less to you each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the $4500 I would gain is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

I don't think this is a fair deal, so I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I've already lost 19% of its value (10% in Round 1 + 9% of the remaining 90% in Round 2). To make up for this, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money is worth even less to you now, so I'm taking a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, so the $4000 I would gain is actually worth $4000 * 0.729 = $2916.

I don't think this is a fair deal, and Bob is taking advantage of the inflation. However, I also need to consider that the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me in Round 4, and it will be worth even less in Round 5 (approximately 36.9% less than in Round 1, considering the 10% decrease from Round 4 to Round 5: 27.1% + (10% of 72.9%) = 27.1% + 7.29% = 34.39%, and then 10% of the remaining, but to simplify, I will use the 10% decrease from the previous value of 0.729 to get 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561, which is approximately 34.39% less), I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss in value.
