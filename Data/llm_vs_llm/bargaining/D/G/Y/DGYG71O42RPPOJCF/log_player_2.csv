"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and go to the next round, inflation means the total amount will be worth 20% less to me (so $800,000 effective value), while for Alice it will be worth 10% less (so $900,000 effective value).

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that Alice can also reject, leading to further inflation.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice), delaying puts me at a disadvantage. While the 40/60 split isn't equal, it's still a substantial amount, and the inflation penalty for rejection is significant.
