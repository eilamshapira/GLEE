"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob while considering the inflation effect on my own gains. Since the money is worth 20% less to me each round, I should try to secure a reasonable amount now.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally. A fair 50-50 split should be acceptable to both of us, and this way we can avoid the negative effects of inflation by concluding the game now."
