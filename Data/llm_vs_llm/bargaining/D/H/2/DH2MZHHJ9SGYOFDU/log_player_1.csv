I propose a 99:1 split in my favor. I figure this will be a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept.  I am confident I can get a better deal later if needed."

I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still want a majority of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."

I'm  lowering my demand a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a significant share. This is getting a bit risky, but I'm hoping Bob will realize the value of negotiating sooner rather than later."

I'm getting nervous about the inflation rate. While I'd prefer a higher share, I'm worried the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I'll end up with nothing. I'll accept this offer."
