"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A reasonable starting point. Slightly more for me considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation effect, I'm being generous with this offer. Accept now to avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both.  A fair 50/50 split is the best option now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my side is more severe (19% less) than on Alice's side (9.75% less), and the fact that the offer is a 50/50 split, I think it's a relatively fair proposal given the current situation.
