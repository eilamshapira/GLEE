"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I receive $40 while she keeps $60 from the $100 total. This isn't an equal split, but it's also not extremely unfair. 

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer, and we could potentially go back and forth.

Given that I'm receiving a substantial portion (40%) and avoiding a potentially lengthy negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
