"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal. With each round, the value of the money decreases for me, making it riskier to hold out for a larger share."
