Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation, the $100 is now worth 64% of its original value to me. To account for this, I will propose a division that reflects this loss in value.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

Alice's offer, taking into account the 59.04% reduction in value due to inflation, would be worth approximately $19.6 now, while Alice would effectively gain $81.9. I will accept this offer as further rounds would only decrease the value of the money further for me."
