"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me
   - I could propose something better, but Alice would need to accept
   - My maximum potential in next round would be less than $900,000 (due to 10% depreciation)
   - Alice's counter-proposal would be worth even less due to further depreciation

While 40% isn't ideal, getting $400,000 now is better than risking depreciation and potential further negotiation. The difference between 40% and 50% ($100,000) could be lost in just one round of depreciation.
