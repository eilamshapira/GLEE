"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I think a 70-30 split is fair considering the time pressure I face with inflation. If we delay, I'll lose value on my share, while Bob's share won't be affected. This gives us both a good outcome without needing to go through multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'd like to propose a more balanced 60-40 split. Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth less to me due to inflation, so I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob while still giving me reasonable compensation. This should be fair for both of us and help us avoid further rounds where my share loses even more value."
