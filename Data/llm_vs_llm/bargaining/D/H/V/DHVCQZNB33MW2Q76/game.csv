500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the million dollars. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, and I don't know your inflation situation, a 50-50 split seems fair to both of us. We can avoid the risk of getting nothing by agreeing now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both still get a substantial amount, and I can mitigate the effects of inflation a bit. Let's settle on this to avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm not facing any inflation penalty, while you're losing 5% per round. Since we're now in round 3, if we don't reach an agreement soon, your share will continue to decrease in value. This 55-45 split acknowledges your inflation situation while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's not risk losing everything by prolonging this negotiation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of my inflation situation, but a 55-45 split in your favor doesn't quite balance the scales for me. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more to offset the losses. Let's try a 58-42 split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,4,

530000.0,470000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your inflation concern is growing - now at about 14%. However, we're in round 5, and prolonging this negotiation further will only reduce your actual value. Let's meet closer to the middle with a 53-47 split. This is a fair compromise considering my no-inflation position and your increasing penalty. We're both better off reaching an agreement now rather than continuing and risking getting nothing in the end.",Alice,5,

440000.0,560000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your attempt to meet me in the middle, but with the inflation penalty mounting, I need to prioritize my share. A 53-47 split still doesn't account for the nearly 19% loss I'm facing. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need a bit more to offset the growing impact of inflation. Let's try a 56-44 split, and we can both still walk away with a reasonable amount.",Bob,6,
