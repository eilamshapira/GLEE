"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the million dollars. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, and I don't know your inflation situation, a 50-50 split seems fair to both of us. We can avoid the risk of getting nothing by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both still get a substantial amount, and I can mitigate the effects of inflation a bit. Let's settle on this to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm not facing any inflation penalty, while you're losing 5% per round. Since we're now in round 3, if we don't reach an agreement soon, your share will continue to decrease in value. This 55-45 split acknowledges your inflation situation while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's not risk losing everything by prolonging this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of my inflation situation, but a 55-45 split in your favor doesn't quite balance the scales for me. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more to offset the losses. Let's try a 58-42 split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your inflation concern is growing - now at about 14%. However, we're in round 5, and prolonging this negotiation further will only reduce your actual value. Let's meet closer to the middle with a 53-47 split. This is a fair compromise considering my no-inflation position and your increasing penalty. We're both better off reaching an agreement now rather than continuing and risking getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000

""alice_gain"": 440000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your attempt to meet me in the middle, but with the inflation penalty mounting, I need to prioritize my share. A 53-47 split still doesn't account for the nearly 19% loss I'm facing. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need a bit more to offset the growing impact of inflation. Let's try a 56-44 split, and we can both still walk away with a reasonable amount.""}"
