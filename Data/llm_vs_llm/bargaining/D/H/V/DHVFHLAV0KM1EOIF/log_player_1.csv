Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a split of $7000 for me and $3000 for you. This deal benefits us both immediately, avoiding any further loss in value from inflation. I believe it's a fair offer to wrap up the division quickly. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split would be fairer. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is closer to an equal division while still giving you a significant portion. Let's avoid further rounds and potential value loss by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
