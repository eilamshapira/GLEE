"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a split of $7000 for me and $3000 for you. This deal benefits us both immediately, avoiding any further loss in value from inflation. I believe it's a fair offer to wrap up the division quickly. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $3000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less for me
   * Maximum I could get in next round if Alice accepts: $9000, but worth $8100 due to inflation
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss

$3000 right now is quite low (only 30% of the total), and even with inflation risk, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Alice's opening with a 70-30 split in their favor suggests room for negotiation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while acknowledging the inflation risk for both parties:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split would be fairer. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is closer to an equal division while still giving you a significant portion. Let's avoid further rounds and potential value loss by agreeing now.""}"
