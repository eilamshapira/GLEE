"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial proposal to divide the $10,000. Since Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, I should offer him a fair amount that would incentivize him to accept now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure Bob faces while still securing a good portion for myself."
