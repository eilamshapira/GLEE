"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. This is round 1, so there's no inflation penalty yet
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but my money will be worth 10% less in the next round
4. $4,500 now is better than $5,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $4,500 after 10% inflation)
5. This is actually a pretty fair offer, considering Alice has the first-mover advantage

Given these factors, I'll accept. While it's not a 50-50 split, it's reasonable enough, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
