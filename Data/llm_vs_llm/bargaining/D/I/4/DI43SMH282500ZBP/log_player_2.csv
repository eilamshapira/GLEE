"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 79.05 
# Alice gain: 20.95 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the inflation rates for both me and Alice.

Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice with each passing round, I should evaluate if the initial split of $79.05 for me and $20.95 for Alice is favorable enough to accept immediately.

Since this is the first round, the full $100 is still available, and no depreciation has occurred yet. The offer gives me 79.05% of the total amount, which is a significant majority.

Considering the depreciation rates, if I reject this offer, the total value of the money will decrease, but the decrease affects Alice more significantly than me. However, I also need to consider that if the game goes on for too many rounds, the value could decrease substantially for both of us.

Given that this is a very favorable offer for me and considering the risk of losing value over time, I decide to accept this offer to secure the majority of the funds immediately.
