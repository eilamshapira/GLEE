Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split to ensure we both get an equal share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair split, and accepting it ensures that we both get an equal share of the money. There's no guarantee that future offers will be better, and there's no advantage to waiting since inflation does not affect me."
