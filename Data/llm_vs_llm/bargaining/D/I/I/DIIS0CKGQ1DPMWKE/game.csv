5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and neither of us loses value to inflation. Let's make this simple and mutually beneficial.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer! How about we try a 60/40 split? It gives me a slight edge considering the inflation risk, and we both still get a good deal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I need to ask for a slightly higher share because of the inflation penalty affecting me. At 20% inflation per round, my $5000 from round 1 would now only be worth $4000 to me. With this 55/45 split, we both still get a fair deal considering the inflation I'm facing, and we can avoid further devaluation by agreeing now.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation concerns. Let's meet halfway â€“ 58/42. This considers the inflation impact while still being a reasonable agreement for both of us. We're getting close to the deadline, so it's in our best interest to settle soon.",Bob,4,
