"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and neither of us loses value to inflation. Let's make this simple and mutually beneficial.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer! How about we try a 60/40 split? It gives me a slight edge considering the inflation risk, and we both still get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I need to ask for a slightly higher share because of the inflation penalty affecting me. At 20% inflation per round, my $5000 from round 1 would now only be worth $4000 to me. With this 55/45 split, we both still get a fair deal considering the inflation I'm facing, and we can avoid further devaluation by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation concerns. Let's meet halfway â€“ 58/42. This considers the inflation impact while still being a reasonable agreement for both of us. We're getting close to the deadline, so it's in our best interest to settle soon. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800
