"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and neither of us loses value to inflation. Let's make this simple and mutually beneficial. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to ask for a slightly higher share because of the inflation penalty affecting me. At 20% inflation per round, my $5000 from round 1 would now only be worth $4000 to me. With this 55/45 split, we both still get a fair deal considering the inflation I'm facing, and we can avoid further devaluation by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is arguing her side and the impact of inflation, it's still beneficial for me to try and secure a better deal.  A 55/45 split in her favor is already leaning significantly towards her, and it's worth seeing if she'll budge a bit more before accepting."
