Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a split of 5500 for me and 4500 for you is fair considering we're now in round 2. Let's settle this and avoid further rounds. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
