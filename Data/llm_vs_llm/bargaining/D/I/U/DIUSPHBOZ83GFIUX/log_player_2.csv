"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $2000 out of the $10,000, which means she would get $8000. This is a very lopsided split in her favor (20% for me, 80% for her).

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider that the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. So instead of $10,000, we'd be splitting what is effectively $9,500 from my perspective.

I think I can propose a fairer split, even accounting for the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the 5% inflation I've already incurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750}

I'm offering a split where I get $5,250 and Alice gets $4,750. This is a much more fair distribution than Alice's initial offer. I'm asking for slightly more than half to compensate for the 5% inflation penalty I've already taken, but I'm still leaving Alice with a substantial portion to make it attractive for her to accept rather than move to another round where we both lose value."
