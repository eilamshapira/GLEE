Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this fails. I'm proposing 58/42 - it's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still keeps things fair considering the time pressure.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, 52.5/47.5 seems like a reasonable middle ground. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I would prefer a slightly larger share, Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, and the longer this goes on, the more we both lose to inflation.  It's time to be pragmatic and secure a win, even if it's not perfect."
