"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates for me and Bob. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but loses 20% value for Bob each round, I should propose a division that gives Bob enough to accept now rather than waiting for the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, 
""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 now, which is better than what he would effectively get if we moved to another round where the money would be worth 20% less to him. This is a fair offer given our different situations with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer in round 3.

Bob has offered me $550,000 and would take $450,000 for himself. If I reject and we go to round 3, Bob would face another 20% inflation on his value. This means in round 3, each dollar would be worth only 64% of the original value to Bob (80% of 80%).

Given that Bob is facing significant inflation penalties while I face none, I can likely make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round. However, I should also consider that we might end up in a cycle of rejections that could reduce the total value of the agreement.

Since I can likely get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's worsening position from inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob is facing even more pressure from inflation. Each dollar is now worth only 64% of its original value to him (after two 20% reductions). I can use this to propose a more favorable division for myself while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept rather than face another round of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 850000, 
""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm offering Bob $150,000, which is worth about $96,000 in his perceived value due to inflation. If he rejects and we go to another round, any money he gets would be worth even less to him. This offer is designed to be more favorable to me while still being rational for Bob to accept given the inflation pressure he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer considering our current position in round 4.

Bob has offered me $700,000 and would take $300,000 for himself. At this point, Bob's money is worth only 51.2% of its original value to him (after three rounds of 20% inflation). So his $300,000 is actually worth about $153,600 in his perceived value.

If I reject and we go to round 5, Bob would face another 20% inflation, making each dollar worth only about 41% of the original value to him. This would strengthen my negotiating position further.

Given that I have no inflation penalty and Bob's position continues to weaken with each round, I can likely get a better offer in the next round. The current offer of $700,000 for me is better than previous offers, but I believe I can get more by continuing the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now we're in round 5, and Bob's inflation penalty is even more severe. Each dollar is now worth only about 41% of its original value to him (after four rounds of 20% reductions). This gives me significant leverage to propose a division that's more favorable to me while still being rational for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, 
""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is worth about $41,000 in his perceived value due to inflation. If he rejects and we go to another round, any money he gets would be worth even less to him. At this point, Bob should be motivated to accept rather than continue negotiating as his position continues to weaken with each round. This offer maximizes my gain while still giving Bob a reason to end the negotiation."
