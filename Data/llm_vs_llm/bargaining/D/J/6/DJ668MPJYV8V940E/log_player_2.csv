"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $800,000. I'll make a proposal to divide this amount.

""alice_gain"": 550000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I were to receive $150,000, its actual value to me would be 64% of $150,000, which is $96,000. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less (or 64% of the original value) for me after the first two rounds of rejection and then another round, and now another, the effective amount is $640,000 * 0.8 = $512,000 (48% of the original $1,000,000, or 64% * 0.8 = 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512). I'll make a proposal to divide this amount, but keeping in mind the actual values.

To make it simple, I will offer:
{""bob_gain"": 300000, 
""alice_gain"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I were to receive $100,000, its actual value to me would be 40.96% of $100,000, which is $40,960.

Given this significant decrease in value, I should consider accepting the offer to get at least some value.
