"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 
- It's a 50-50 split which seems fair at first glance
- However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
- The money will be worth 5% less next round though
- If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'll lose another 5% value
- A fair split now is better than risking further devaluation
