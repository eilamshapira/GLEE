"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":90,""bob_gain"":10,""message"":""Let's keep it simple. You get $10, and I take $90. It's a lot, but it's better than nothing!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more equitable split of $60 for me and $40 for you. This is fair because if we go to another round, the money will be worth 10% less to you. Let's settle now with this balanced offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
