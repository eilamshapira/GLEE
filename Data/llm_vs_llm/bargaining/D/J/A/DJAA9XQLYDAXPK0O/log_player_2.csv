"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple. You get $10, and I take $90. It's a lot, but it's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $10 and gives her $90. While I understand Alice wants a larger share, this division is very uneven.

Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $10 now
- If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
- The money doesn't lose value for me between rounds
- The money loses 10% value for Alice each round

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to reject this offer and make a more balanced proposal in the next round. Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty, so she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the inflation dynamics.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more equitable split of $60 for me and $40 for you. This is fair because if we go to another round, the money will be worth 10% less to you. Let's settle now with this balanced offer.""}"
