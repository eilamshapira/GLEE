"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that I believe is fair for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, which gives each of us $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally. Since there's no inflation affecting me across rounds, I'm happy to start with this balanced offer."
