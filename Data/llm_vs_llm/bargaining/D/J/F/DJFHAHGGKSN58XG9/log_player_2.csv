"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to the 10% inflation effect for me, the money will be worth less - the total $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I proposed to take all $1,000,000 (which Alice would likely reject), it would only be worth $900,000 to me.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that $400,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
