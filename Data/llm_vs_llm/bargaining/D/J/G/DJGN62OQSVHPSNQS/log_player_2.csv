"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50/50 split: $50 each
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round my share would be worth 5% less
4. If I got $50 next round, it would only be worth $47.50 to me
5. This is a fair initial offer, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky
