"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. Due to 5% inflation per round, the $5000 will be worth $4750 next round for me
4. Alice might reject my next offer, leading to further inflation losses
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk and the fact that it's a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
