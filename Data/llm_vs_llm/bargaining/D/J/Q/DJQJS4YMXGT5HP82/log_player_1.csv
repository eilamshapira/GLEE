"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to start with, keeping in mind that inflation will affect me if we go to additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a reasonable amount without risking the money losing value through inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation effects carefully. Since I know the money loses 10% value for me each round and 5% for Bob each round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm proposing a slight adjustment from my initial offer to account for the inflation differences between us. This division gives Bob a bit more than an even split while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. Given that we're now in round 3 and further delays will reduce the value for both of us, this seems like a reasonable compromise."
