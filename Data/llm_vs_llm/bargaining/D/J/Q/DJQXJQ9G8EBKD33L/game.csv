6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. We should both be motivated to end this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. We've both lost value due to inflation already, and further delays will hurt us both. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think you're coming out ahead. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a bit more. Let's settle this before inflation takes a bigger bite.",Bob,4,
