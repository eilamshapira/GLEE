"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. We should both be motivated to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes inflation into account. A 55-45 split in Bob's favor is too steep given I made a more generous initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. We've both lost value due to inflation already, and further delays will hurt us both. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think you're coming out ahead. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a bit more. Let's settle this before inflation takes a bigger bite. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains, and Bob's offer is fairly reasonable at this point. A 47.5-52.5 split is close enough to equal, and continuing to negotiate would only reduce the real value of my share further."
