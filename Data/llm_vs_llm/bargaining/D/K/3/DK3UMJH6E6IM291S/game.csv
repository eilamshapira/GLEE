55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's grab this deal before inflation eats away at our gains!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's make a deal before inflation reduces our gains! My offer is more favorable to me, but still leaves you with a significant amount. Consider it carefully!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
62.0,38.0,"Bob, the money is losing value quickly! My offer is now 62 for me and 38 for you. This accounts for the previous rejected offer and continued inflation. Let's lock this in before we both lose out.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Inflation is indeed eating away at our potential gains, but I'm not willing to settle for less. My offer reflects the current value of the money, and I'm being generous considering the circumstances. Think carefully before rejecting!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
68.0,32.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! Inflation is killing us! I need 68 to compensate for the earlier low offer and the rapid value decline. You get 32. Accept it now, or we'll both end up with nothing!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to give up that much. With inflation rising, I need to secure a larger share to ensure I don't end up with practically nothing. This is my final reasonable offer, Alice.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
73.0,27.0,"Bob, this is a last chance to get something. My final offer is 73 for me, and 27 for you. Take it or leave it. We are running out of time!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, I know we're both taking a risk by continuing, but I believe I can get a better deal. With inflation skyrocketing, I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my offer, take it or we'll see what happens next.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
77.0,23.0,"Bob, this is absolutely the last round I'm making an offer. 77 for me, 23 for you. If you decline, we get nothing. Think very carefully. I'm done negotiating.",Alice,9,
