"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 5% loss in value each round if he declines.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair but slightly advantageous offer for me. I'm offering Bob a solid $4,000 now, which would be worth less to him if he declines and we move to the next round. If he's rational, he should consider accepting this since waiting would reduce his money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,000, while taking $6,000 for himself
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's value will decrease by another 5%
   - My value stays the same
3. This means in the next round, Bob's $6,000 would only be worth $5,700 to him
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for the next round

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, and Bob's decreasing value gives me more bargaining power.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob has now experienced two rounds of inflation (total 10% decrease in value for him), I can make a more assertive offer. He should be more inclined to accept now since further delays will continue to decrease the value for him.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I'm offering Bob $3,500 now, which is worth more to him than a larger amount in future rounds due to his 5% per round inflation. For perspective, even $4,000 would be worth only $3,800 to him in the next round. This offer is rational for both parties given the inflation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,500, while taking $5,500 for himself
2. If I reject and we go to round 5:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's value will decrease by another 5% (to about 19% total reduction)
   - My value stays the same
3. Bob's $5,500 is already worth only about $4,716 to him (due to 14.26% inflation)
4. In the next round, his money would be worth even less

While this offer is better than his previous one, I still have strong negotiating leverage due to the continuing inflation effect on Bob's side. I can likely get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob has now experienced four rounds of inflation (about 19% total decrease in value for him), and has shown willingness to increase his offers to me, I'll make a strong but not extreme offer that should be compelling for him to accept:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This offer makes sense because:
1. For Bob, $3,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to continuing inflation
2. If he rejects, his next offer would need to be significantly higher to compensate for my patience (since I don't face inflation)
3. The continuing inflation threat makes this a rational point for him to settle
4. This is still better for him than continuing several more rounds where his value would decrease even further"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. Due to 22.62% inflation for Bob, his $5,000 is actually only worth about $3,869 to him
3. If I reject and go to round 7:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's value will decrease by another 5% (to about 27% total reduction)
   - My value stays the same
4. The fact that Bob has moved to a 50-50 split shows he's feeling the pressure of inflation

However, given that:
- We've already gone through several rounds
- Bob is showing significant movement in my direction
- $5,000 is a respectable amount
- Further negotiation might lead to deteriorating cooperation

I will accept this offer. While I might theoretically get more by continuing, this is a fair compromise that gives me half of the total amount with no inflation impact.
