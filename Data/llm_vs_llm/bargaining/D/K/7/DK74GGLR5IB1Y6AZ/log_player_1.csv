"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is a fair starting offer, giving Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to secure a reasonable amount for myself. This initial offer shows I'm willing to be generous but also value my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since he's asking for a significantly larger portion (60%) while only offering me 40% of the money, which is less favorable than my initial proposal. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can make another offer in the next round that might be more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a completely fair 50-50 split. This is an equitable division that gives us both equal shares of the money. Given that Bob faces inflation penalties with each round, this balanced offer should be appealing as it gives him half of the total amount while being fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since he's now asking for an even larger share (65%) while offering me only 35% of the money. Even with the inflation penalty he's facing, this division is increasingly unfavorable to me compared to previous offers. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger portion of the money (52.5%) while I take 47.5%. Given the increasing inflation penalty Bob faces, this division gives him more than half of the total amount which should be attractive to him, while still being reasonable for me. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure Bob is under due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since he's now asking for 70% of the money while offering me only 30%. Despite his increasing inflation penalty, this division is even more unfavorable to me than his previous offers. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round that better accounts for both our interests."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob 55% of the money ($550,000) while I take 45% ($450,000). With Bob's significant inflation penalty now at over 40%, this division gives him a meaningful majority of the funds while still being reasonable for me. This offer acknowledges the pressure from inflation that Bob is facing while finding a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject Bob's offer since he's now asking for 75% of the money while offering me only 25%. Even with his substantial inflation penalty of over 52%, this division continues to become increasingly unfavorable to me compared to previous offers. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 425000, ""bob_gain"": 575000}

I'm offering Bob 57.5% of the money ($575,000) while I take 42.5% ($425,000). With Bob's inflation penalty now exceeding 52%, this division gives him a substantial majority of the funds to help offset his inflation losses. This is my most generous offer yet, acknowledging the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share while still maintaining a reasonable portion for myself."
