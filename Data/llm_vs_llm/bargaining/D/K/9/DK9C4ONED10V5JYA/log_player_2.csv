"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me $444,444 (about 44.4% of the total)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, it's reasonably close. If I reject and go to the next round, even if I propose a better split, the 20% inflation penalty means I'd need to get significantly more just to break even with the current offer.

$444,444 now is better than potentially getting $500,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $400,000 to me due to inflation).
