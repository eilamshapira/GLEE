"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. This is a fair offer in general, but I should consider the inflation aspect.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. So in the next round, the full $10,000 would only be worth $9,500 to me. If I were to propose and receive a larger percentage in the next round, I'd need to get more than $5,000/$9,500 = approximately 52.6% of the pie to do better than accepting now.

Given that we're in the first round with many potential rounds ahead, and the fair initial offer from Alice, I think accepting is the reasonable choice.
