"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $40, I need to consider the inflation effect. With each round, the money is worth 10% less to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will already be reduced by 10% for me.

Let me think about this: $40 now is better than waiting and potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pie. If I reject and propose a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 but it would be worth 10% less to me, so effectively $45.
