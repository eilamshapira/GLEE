"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - The money will be worth 20% less to Alice

Since Alice's inflation rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), I have leverage by waiting. In the next round, Alice will be more motivated to accept a better deal for me since her money will devalue more quickly.

I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money devalues much faster (20% vs my 5%), I should propose a split more in my favor, but not too extreme to ensure acceptance. The money is now worth less to both of us, and Alice especially needs to consider this when deciding.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given the higher inflation rate you face (20% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than wait for another round where your share would be worth significantly less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle accounting for inflation. I'm offering 550k now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which due to 9.75% inflation is worth about $406,125 to me
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - I'll get another chance to make an offer
   - My inflation will increase to about 15%
   - Alice's inflation will increase to about 56%
   - Alice will be under much more pressure to accept

Since Alice's inflation rate is increasing much faster than mine (20% per round vs 5%), I still have leverage. The difference in our inflation rates is growing, which means I can likely get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With the inflation rates now heavily impacting Alice (56% for her vs 15% for me), I can propose a more favorable split. Alice should be highly motivated to accept now rather than risk another round of severe devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""At this point, your share is already worth less than half its original value due to 56% inflation, while my inflation is only 15%. If we go another round, your loss to inflation will be severe. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
