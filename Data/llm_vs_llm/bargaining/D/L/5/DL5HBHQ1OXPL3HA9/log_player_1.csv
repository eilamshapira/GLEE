"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game to divide $10,000 between myself and Bob.

My offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing a relatively fair split, but with a slight advantage to me. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round while I face no inflation, he has more incentive to accept sooner rather than wait for future rounds. This offer gives him a substantial portion while recognizing my stronger position in the game."
