"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4800$ and taking 5200$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 5% less
3. 4800$ in next round would only be worth 4560$ to me
4. The difference between accepting now and potentially getting a bit more next round (with 5% penalty) makes this a reasonable offer
5. There's also risk in rejection as Alice might counter with worse offers
