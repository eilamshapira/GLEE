"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value I'd receive. If I accept Bob's offer, I'd get $450,000, but its value to me is 20% less than its face value due to inflation. So, the effective value to me would be 80% of $450,000, which is $360,000.

Considering this, and knowing that I have to make the most out of the situation, I'll evaluate if this offer is acceptable or if I should reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round, keeping in mind the further reduction in value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob rejected my initial 50/50 offer and then offered a split that favored him, and considering the inflation factor that reduces the value of my potential gain by 20% each round, I need to balance making an attractive offer with ensuring I don't undervalue my share.

In Round 2, the value of the money to me was 80% of the original. Now, in Round 3, it's 80% * 80% = 64% of the original value due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

To make a competitive offer while protecting my interests, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing value of the money to me but still tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This offer slightly adjusts in Bob's favor compared to my initial proposal, acknowledging his previous offer and the need to reach an agreement before further inflation erodes the value of my potential share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, the actual value of Bob's offer to me is significantly reduced. To calculate the effective value:

$380,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $380,000 * 0.512 = $194,560

This means that, in real terms considering the inflation, Bob's offer of $380,000 is effectively worth $194,560 to me.

Given this substantial reduction in value and considering that I still have several rounds to negotiate, I will reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in subsequent rounds, despite the risk of further inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money to me by 48.8%, and knowing that each round this value decreases further, I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept but also protects my interests as much as possible.

Given that Bob's previous offer indicated he might be willing to accept a split where he gets more than half, but not excessively so, I'll aim for a compromise. However, I must also consider that the value of the money to me decreases by 20% each round, so the effective value of any offer I make will be less to me than its face value.

In Round 5, the value to me is 80% of the Round 4 value, which was already 51.2% of the original. So, the cumulative effect is 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096 or 40.96% of the original value.

To make a competitive offer, I might need to skew the split slightly more in Bob's favor than I ideally would, hoping he accepts before the inflation renders my potential gain too small.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

This offer gives Bob 60% of the total, which is more favorable to him than my initial offer but still leaves me with a significant share, considering the diminished value due to inflation."
