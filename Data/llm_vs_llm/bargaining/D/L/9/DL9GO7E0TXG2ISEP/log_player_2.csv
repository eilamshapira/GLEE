"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. It's fair and we can end this quickly before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split of $10,000
2. If I reject:
   - Money will be worth 20% less for me next round
   - I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject
   - Further rounds mean more value loss for both of us
3. Alice's point about inflation is valid
4. A fair split right now is better than a potentially larger share that's worth less

The offer is reasonable and avoiding inflation is important. It's better to secure $5,000 now than risk getting less value in future rounds.
