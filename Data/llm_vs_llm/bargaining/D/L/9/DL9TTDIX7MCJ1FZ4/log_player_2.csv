"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because I face 10% inflation each round. This is a fair initial offer that gives us both substantial amounts. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing everything due to the time constraint. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is claiming she also faces inflation, but I know for sure that I face 10% inflation per round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value to me will decrease by 10%.

Let me analyze: If I accept now, I get $450,000. If I reject and we take another round, the maximum I could get would be subject to 10% inflation, meaning even if I got the full $1,000,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $900,000 to me.

Given that we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds or get nothing, and that the value decreases for me each round, accepting a reasonable first offer makes sense.
