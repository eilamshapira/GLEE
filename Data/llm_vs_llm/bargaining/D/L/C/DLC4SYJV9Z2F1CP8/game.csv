500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with an even split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. With each round the money loses value (20% less for me), it's best we close the deal promptly. I believe this fair division benefits us bothâ€”let me know if you agree.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but considering the 20% inflation per round for me, I think it's fair to ask for a bit more. How about I get $550000 and you get $450000? This way, we both still get a good amount, but it accounts for the loss in value for me.",Bob,2,
