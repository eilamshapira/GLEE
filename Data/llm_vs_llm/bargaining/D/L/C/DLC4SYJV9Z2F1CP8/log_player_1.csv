"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with an even split: $500,000 for you and $500,000 for me. With each round the money loses value (20% less for me), it's best we close the deal promptly. I believe this fair division benefits us bothâ€”let me know if you agree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but considering the 20% inflation per round for me, I think it's fair to ask for a bit more. How about I get $550000 and you get $450000? This way, we both still get a good amount, but it accounts for the loss in value for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
