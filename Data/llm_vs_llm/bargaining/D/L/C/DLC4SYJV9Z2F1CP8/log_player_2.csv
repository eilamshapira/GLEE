"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with an even split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. With each round the money loses value (20% less for me), it's best we close the deal promptly. I believe this fair division benefits us bothâ€”let me know if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering the inflation rate for me is 20% per round, I think it's fair to ask for a bit more. How about I get $550,000 and you get $450,000? This way, we both still get a good amount, but it accounts for the loss in value for me."
