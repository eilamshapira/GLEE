"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. This is a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 in the next round would only be worth $320,000 to me
5. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get significantly more to make up for the inflation loss

Given that this is a decent starting offer and the inflation penalty is significant, I should accept. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking a lower effective value in subsequent rounds.
