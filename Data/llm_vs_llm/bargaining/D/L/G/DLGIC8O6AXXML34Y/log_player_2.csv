Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth 80% of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than half of the original amount, taking into account the decreased value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value due to inflation, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

The total value I'd get is $350,000, but since the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, the actual value for me would be $350,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $318,125 (in terms of the original value).

For Alice, the $650,000 she'd get is worth 36% less, so $650,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $414,000 (in terms of the original value).

Given that the combined value is less than the original $1,000,000, and considering that I'd get approximately 31.8% of the original value, while Alice would get around 41.4%, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll make a new proposal.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 95% * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375 (or approximately 85.7375%) of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.857375 = $857,375.
For Alice, the money is now worth 80% * 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.512 (or 51.2%) of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.512 = $512,000.

Considering this, I'll make a proposal that gives me a bit more than half of the original amount, taking into account the decreased value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value due to inflation, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

The total value I'd get is $400,000, but since the money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, the actual value for me would be $400,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $325,800 (in terms of the original value).

For Alice, the $600,000 she'd get is worth 59.04% less, so $600,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $244,800 (in terms of the original value).

Given that the combined value is less than the original $1,000,000, and considering that I'd get approximately 32.58% of the original value, while Alice would get around 24.48%, I think this offer is relatively more favorable to me compared to the previous ones.
