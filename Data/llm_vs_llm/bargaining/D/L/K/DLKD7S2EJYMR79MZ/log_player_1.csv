"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the inflation affecting my share, I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's settle this soon. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $45, which has no inflation effect for me
2. Bob would get $55, but it's worth 10% less to him due to inflation
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's inflation will increase
4. The offer is reasonable, considering we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush
