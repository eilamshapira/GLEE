"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This gives us both $500000, which is completely fair since we have equal standing in this negotiation. We both walk away with half a million dollars - a life-changing amount for most people. I believe fairness and equality are the best principles for this division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
