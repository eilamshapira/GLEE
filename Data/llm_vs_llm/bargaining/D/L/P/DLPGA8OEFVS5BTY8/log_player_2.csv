"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with a 60-40 ratio in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000. While this is a substantial amount, I believe a more equal distribution would be fair since we both have equal standing in this negotiation. If I reject, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This gives us both $500,000, which is completely fair since we have equal standing in this negotiation. We both walk away with half a million dollars - a life-changing amount for most people. I believe fairness and equality are the best principles for this division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on fairness, but I believe a slight adjustment is reasonable. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging my position in the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has adjusted her offer to a 55-45 split in her favor, which would give me $450,000 and her $550,000. While this is improvement from her initial 60-40 offer, I still believe an equal split would be most fair. However, I need to consider that if I reject and the negotiation continues, we might end up with further back-and-forth that could waste time. The $450,000 is still a substantial amount, and the difference of $50,000 might not be worth the risk of further negotiation rounds.
