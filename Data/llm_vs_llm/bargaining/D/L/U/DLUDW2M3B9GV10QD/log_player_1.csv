"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that money depreciates more for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges this time pressure difference. Let's avoid losing value through negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a fair split, considering our different depreciation rates. This offer gives us an equal share, but given the depreciation, it slightly favors you. I'm open to negotiating, but let's try to reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
