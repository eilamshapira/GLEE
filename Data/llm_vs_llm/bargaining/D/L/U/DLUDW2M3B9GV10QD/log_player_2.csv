"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that money depreciates more for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges this time pressure difference. Let's avoid losing value through negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's calculate the value of the money after the first round for both of us, considering the depreciation rates.

For me (Bob), the money depreciates by 20% per round. So, if I accept the offer now, I get $45.

For Alice, the money depreciates by 5% per round. So, if she gets $55 now, it's worth $55 to her.

Given that I have 12 rounds to negotiate and the significant depreciation rate for me, I should consider whether waiting could benefit me more, despite the risk of losing value.

However, since this is the first round and I haven't made my own proposal yet, I should evaluate if Alice's offer is reasonable enough to accept early, minimizing the loss due to depreciation.

Considering Alice's argument about reaching an agreement early to avoid losing value, and given that her offer, while not perfectly even, does acknowledge the disparity in depreciation rates, I will evaluate the offer based on its immediate value to me versus the potential risks and rewards of waiting.

Given the information and the fact that this is just the first round, I think it's reasonable to consider Alice's offer seriously, but I also want to see if I can get a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round.

Therefore, my decision for this round is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the depreciation rates and the fact that I want to reach a fair agreement as soon as possible to minimize losses, I'll make an offer that slightly favors me but is still reasonable for Alice.

Given that the money depreciates by 20% for me and 5% for Alice per round, and we are now in the second round, the effective value of the $100 for me is 80% of $100 (since 20% is lost in the first round), which is $80. For Alice, it's 95% of $100, which is $95.

My proposal for this round will be to take $50 for myself and give $50 to Alice. However, considering the depreciation, the actual value actually slightly favors Alice due to her lower depreciation rate.

Here's my offer in JSON format:
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's aim for a fair split, considering our different depreciation rates. This offer gives us an equal share, but given the depreciation, it slightly favors you. I'm open to negotiating, but let's try to reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses.""}"
