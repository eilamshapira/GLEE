"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value for me by 10% each time.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. I'm offering Bob a substantial 40% of the total amount, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and I'm affected by inflation in future rounds. If Bob rejects this, the next round's money will be worth less to me, so I'm incentivized to make a serious offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer now:
   * I would get $4000, but it's worth only $3600 to me (90% of $4000)
   * Bob would get $6000 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But the money will be worth another 10% less to me (80% of face value)
   * For any amount X I get in round 3, it will only be worth 0.8X to me

Since I can make the next offer if I reject, and there's still room for negotiation despite the inflation penalty, I'll reject this offer. I believe I can still achieve a better outcome even with the next round's inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 3 now, any money I receive is worth only 80% of its face value to me, while Bob still gets full value. I need to account for this while making a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept, as another rejection would put me in an even worse position.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering this split because:
1. While the 5500 is only worth 4400 to me (due to 20% inflation), it's still better than Bob's last offer (which was worth 3600 to me)
2. Bob gets 4500, which is a fair increase from my initial offer of 4000
3. If Bob rejects this, we'll go to round 4 where my money will be worth even less (70% of face value), so I'm motivated to make this a serious offer that could end the game"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept now:
   * I would get $3500, but it's worth only $2551.50 to me (72.9% of $3500)
   * Bob would get $6500 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But the money will be worth another 10% less to me (only 62.9% of face value)
   * For any amount X I get in round 5, it will only be worth 0.629X to me

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. Even if I make a new offer next round, I would need to secure a much larger nominal amount to make up for the inflation, which Bob is unlikely to accept.

Given the deteriorating situation and the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
