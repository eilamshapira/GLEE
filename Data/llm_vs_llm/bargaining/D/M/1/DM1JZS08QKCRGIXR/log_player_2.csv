"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

A 50-50 split is fair, but with inflation affecting my gains in future rounds, I should consider accepting early offers more favorably. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my potential $50 would already be worth 20% less ($40).

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of a drawn-out negotiation with compounding inflation makes this fair first-round offer quite attractive.
