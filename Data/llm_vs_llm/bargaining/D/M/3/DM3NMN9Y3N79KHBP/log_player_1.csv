"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing each round. It's becoming increasingly important to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting the initial 60/40 split suggests he believes he can get a better deal. 
* **Compromise:** Offering 55/45 is a compromise. It's slightly less than my initial offer but still gives me a slight advantage. It might be enough to entice Bob while the value of the money hasn't degraded too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Significant Inflation:** The money is now worth 27.1% less than in round 1.  This is a substantial decrease, and waiting any longer significantly risks getting even less.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively better for him (50/50, then 52/48).  There's a real chance his next offer will be even less favorable, especially with the inflation working against me. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer provides a guaranteed, albeit reduced, payout.  Rejecting it risks getting a much worse deal in the next round, especially with the increasing inflation. 

It's frustrating to accept less than initially desired, but the rapidly declining value of the money makes this the safest and most rational decision at this point."
