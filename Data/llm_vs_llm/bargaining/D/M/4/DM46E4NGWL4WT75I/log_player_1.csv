"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm Alice and this is the first round, I'll make a strategic offer considering that Bob faces a 20% devaluation per round. I'll propose a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too extreme to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives Bob a substantial amount ($400,000)
2. If Bob rejects, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to him
3. The split is not too greedy, showing willingness to compromise"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to 20% inflation for Bob, his $500,000 is actually worth only $400,000 to him
3. My $500,000 still has full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. This is actually a pretty fair offer considering the inflation effect

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept because this is a fair split that gives me full value while accounting for Bob's inflation penalty. Making another offer might lead to unnecessary rounds and risk."
