"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, taking inflation into account:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 498750, ""alice_gain"": 501250}
```

(I'm aiming for a slightly better split for myself, considering the 5% inflation on my end. The original $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000 to me. Therefore I am offering Alice more in this round than I would if there was no inflation.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 4, adjusted for inflation:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 471000, ""alice_gain"": 529000}
```

(The initial $1,000,000 is now worth ~ $902,500 to me after cumulative inflation. I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still making the offer attractive enough that Alice will accept, as the money is losing value for me.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 325000 
# Alice gain: 675000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 6, factoring in the accumulated inflation:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 443000, ""alice_gain"": 557000}
```

(At this point, the original $1,000,000 is worth only approximately $857,375 to me due to inflation. I'm increasing the split in Alice's favor, hoping she accepts this time.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 8, with even more inflation factored in:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 410000, ""alice_gain"": 590000}
```

(The original $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $814,506 to me. Inflation is really eating into my potential gains, so I am increasing the offered portion to Alice, to increase the chance of acceptance.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 275000 
# Alice gain: 725000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 10. Inflation is really hurting me now, so I'm making a more generous offer to Alice:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 375000, ""alice_gain"": 625000}
```

(At this point, the original $1,000,000 is worth around $773,786 to me. It's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is the last round. Inflation has been brutal. I have to make a very compelling offer to avoid getting nothing. Here's my final offer:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000}
```

(At this point, the original $1,000,000 is worth roughly $735,091 to me. Giving up the 300,000 is still better than receiving nothing in the next round.)"
