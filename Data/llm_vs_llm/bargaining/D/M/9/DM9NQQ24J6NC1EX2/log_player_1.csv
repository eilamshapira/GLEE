"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 50-50 split? It's fair and avoids any loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, $50 is now worth effectively $40 to me
2. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offer is equal split, which is fair
4. Getting $40 in effective value now is better than risking further inflation
