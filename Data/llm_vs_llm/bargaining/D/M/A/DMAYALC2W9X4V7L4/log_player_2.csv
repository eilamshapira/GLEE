"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice offers me $642,857 and keeps $357,143 for herself.

The total amount is $1,000,000. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I get to make a proposal. However, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice in the next round.

This is a reasonable offer that gives me nearly 2/3 of the total amount. Given the inflation penalty for continuing to the next round, accepting now is the rational choice.
