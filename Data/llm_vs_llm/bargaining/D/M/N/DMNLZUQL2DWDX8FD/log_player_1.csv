"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a slightly better split of 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $550,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

For me, the money is worth 5% less again, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less again, so it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't let it slip away""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 40/60 split again, but let's finalize this before it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The money I gain is worth 14.26% less, so the $600,000 Bob offered is worth $600,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $600,000 * 0.8574 = $514,440 to me.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not bad, and considering the inflation, it might be better to accept it rather than risking further devaluation.
