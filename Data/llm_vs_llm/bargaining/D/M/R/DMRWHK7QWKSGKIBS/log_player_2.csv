"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from prolonging negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I would get $4,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $8,000 * 0.8 = $6,400
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While a 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, it's not terrible. Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of further losses in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer is probably the safer choice. A guaranteed $4,000 is better than risking getting less due to inflation.
