Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 46.86, ""bob_gain"": 53.14, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1. Taking into account that any delay costs you (a 10% discount per round for you versus no discount for me), I’m offering $53.14 to you and keeping $46.86 for myself. Accepting now is better for you than waiting for later rounds. What do you think?""}"
