"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1. Taking into account that any delay costs you (a 10% discount per round for you versus no discount for me), I’m offering $53.14 to you and keeping $46.86 for myself. Accepting now is better for you than waiting for later rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 53.14 
# Alice gain: 46.86 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
