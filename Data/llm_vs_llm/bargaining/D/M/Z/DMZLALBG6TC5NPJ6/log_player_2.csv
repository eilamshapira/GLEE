"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where we both get a substantial amount. If we delay, inflation will reduce the value for me, so it's in our interest to agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's offer.

Alice has proposed a split where I (Bob) would receive $4,500 and she would receive $5,500 out of the total $10,000.

While this isn't an even 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer where I would still get a substantial portion (45%) of the total amount. Alice mentions inflation affecting her, suggesting she has an incentive to settle quickly.

I don't face any inflation penalty (0% inflation for me), so I don't lose value by continuing to the next round, where I could propose my own split. However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me in the next round.

Given that $4,500 is a significant amount and represents a reasonable division, I'll accept this offer.
