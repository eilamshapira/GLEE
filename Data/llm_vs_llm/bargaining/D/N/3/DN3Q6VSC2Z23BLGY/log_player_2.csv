"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
2. This is only a 10% share for me
3. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me
4. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer
5. Even with the 10% depreciation, I can propose a more equitable split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that:
1. I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept
2. I need to account for the fact that future rounds will decrease the value for me by 10% each time
3. A fair split would give both parties a reasonable share

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

My proposal is slightly in Alice's favor to make it more appealing, but much more balanced than her initial offer."
