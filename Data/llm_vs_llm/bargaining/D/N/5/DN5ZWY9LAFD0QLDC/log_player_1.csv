"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (using continuous money and discounting for Bob only) the “subgame perfect” proposal for an immediate agreement in Round 1 is to let Bob have about $7,350.92 and Alice about $2,649.08. (The idea is that if Bob declines, then in Round 2 as proposer Bob can secure roughly 7,737.81 nominal dollars—but since his money is worth 5% less in Round 2, his “real” value is about 7,737.81×0.95 = 7,350.92. To make Bob indifferent, Alice must offer him approximately that much in Round 1, leaving her the rest of the $10,000.)

So here is my Round 1 offer in the required JSON format:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 2649.08,
  ""bob_gain"": 7350.92
}"
