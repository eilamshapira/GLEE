"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

To calculate the actual value of the offer to me, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.8 (1 - 0.20 inflation).

Adjusted Alice gain: 5200 * 0.8 = 4160

Considering this, I think I can do better. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% less in Round 2 and another 20% less in Round 3, cumulative effect: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, then 0.8 - 0.2*0.8 = 0.8 - 0.16 = 0.64).

To calculate the actual value of my potential gain, I'll keep this in mind.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the decreasing value, make it worth my while!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing rapidly, Alice. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than the original value. To calculate the actual value of the offer to me, I'll multiply the offered amount by (1 - 0.488) = 0.512.

Adjusted Alice gain: 4500 * 0.512 = 2304

Given that this is Bob's final offer and the value is decreasing rapidly, I should consider accepting it to avoid further losses. My response is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
