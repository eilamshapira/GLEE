# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round due to the inflation impacting her returns. While I would prefer a more equitable split, I need to push her closer to a 50/50 split before the devaluation significantly harms her gains."
