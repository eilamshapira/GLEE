"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $35.71 and you get $64.29 from the $100. Given that money depreciates by 20% for me and 10% for you each round, this split reflects our fair, equilibrium outcome if we were to continue negotiating. I look forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 64.29 
# Alice gain: 35.71 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $64.29, Alice gets $35.71
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But money will be worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice
   * So $100 will effectively be worth $90 for me and $80 for Alice

Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable. She's taken into account the depreciation rates and offered a split that's close to optimal given our different depreciation rates. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, the total value will be less for both of us due to depreciation.

The $64.29 I'm being offered now is better than what I'm likely to get after depreciation in future rounds.
