"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. This is mutually beneficial as we both lose more by delaying.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still want a relatively fair split. Delaying further will only make things worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation penalty is significant (20% for me vs 10% for Bob)
2. My actual value after 20% inflation would be: 525000 * 0.8 = 420000
3. While this is less than my initial proposal, continuing to negotiate would lead to even greater losses due to the asymmetric inflation rates
4. The split is still reasonably fair considering the circumstances
5. There's risk in continuing as Bob might propose worse splits in future rounds, knowing I'm more affected by inflation"
