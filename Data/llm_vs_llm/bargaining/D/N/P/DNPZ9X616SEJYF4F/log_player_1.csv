"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure you understand that starting early benefits both of us. A slightly better split for me seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I need to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the actual value of Bob's offer for me is 4800 * 0.9 = 4320.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

To make a competitive offer, I'll try to find a balance. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4600, 
""bob_gain"": 5400, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much.""}"
