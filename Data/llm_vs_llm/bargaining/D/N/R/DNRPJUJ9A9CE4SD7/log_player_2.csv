"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is offering me $4,500 while she takes $5,500.

If I reject and we move to the next round:
- The total value decreases by 20% for me (meaning $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 to me)
- The total value decreases by 10% for Alice (meaning $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to her)

Since inflation affects me more severely, delaying might not be in my best interest unless I can secure a significantly better deal. If I propose a 50-50 split next round, that would give me $4,000 (after my 20% inflation), which is worse than the current offer.

Alice's current proposal would give me $4,500, which is better than what I might reasonably expect in future rounds given the asymmetric inflation rates.
