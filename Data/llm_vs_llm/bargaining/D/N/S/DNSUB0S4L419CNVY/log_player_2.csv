"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. Since inflation isn't affecting me, and I don't know how it affects you, this seems like the most equitable division. We both walk away with the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. However, due to inflation affecting me by 10% per round, I should consider that:

1. $50 in the current round is better than potentially getting more in later rounds due to the inflation effect
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we'd lose more value to inflation
3. We only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get nothing
4. This is actually a fair opening offer

Given these factors, it makes sense to accept this offer now. Getting $50 in the first round is better than risking a deteriorating value in subsequent rounds.
