Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this split is more equitable. Let's work together to make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the need for a fair deal as time moves forward.""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. While I don't know how it affects Bob, time is a factor.
* **Previous Offers:** Bob rejected my initial offer of 65/35, and his counter-offer of 60/40 wasn't acceptable considering the inflation working against me.
* **Compromise:** This 62/38 offer shows I'm willing to move closer to a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a slightly advantageous split due to the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the current situation and values both of our contributions. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

Bob is clearly trying to push his advantage, knowing that the value decreases for me each round. However, accepting 550,000 now when it's worth only a little over half its original value is a terrible deal. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking another round of inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we need to find a resolution soon. This is my final offer, reflecting a balance between fairness and the need to finalize this agreement.""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  Another round means the money loses even more value for me. I need to make Bob understand this is a critical point.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering slightly more than Bob's last offer (550,000 for me), signaling a willingness to compromise, but this is the furthest I'm willing to go.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding weight to the proposal. It forces Bob to make a decision â€“ accept a decent deal now or risk getting nothing if the negotiations completely stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a balanced offer that ensures both of us receive an equal share. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning:

This is a tough decision, but time is no longer on my side. 

* **Severe Inflation:** The money is now worth significantly less than in the first round. Taking another hit will hurt badly.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation, and he's unlikely to go higher than this. He's dug in on the 50/50 split.
* **Potential Losses:**  If I reject this offer and we enter another round, even if I could secure a slightly higher percentage, the actual value I receive might end up being less than what Bob is offering now due to the inflation. 

This is a disappointing outcome, as I've been forced into a corner by the inflation mechanic. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes further losses."
