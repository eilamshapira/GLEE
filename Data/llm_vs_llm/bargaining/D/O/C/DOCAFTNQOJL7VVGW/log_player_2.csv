"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. So in round 2, the 10000$ will effectively be worth 9500$ to me.

Since this is the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. While 4000$ is a significant amount, getting less than half when there are many rounds left seems premature. I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a more balanced split, but considering that I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

The money is now worth 5% less to me (but not to Alice), so I need to factor that into my decision. I'll propose a fair split that's slightly in my favor to compensate for the time pressure I'm under.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split as it gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting. If she rejects, the next round will cost me another 5% in value, so I'm hoping this balanced offer will be attractive enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from 4000$ to 4200$ for me
2. Due to inflation, the money is worth 9.75% less to me
3. 4200$ in round 3 is actually worth about 3791$ (4200 * 0.9025) to me in real value
4. If I reject, the next round will have a 14.75% reduction in value for me

Alice's slight increase in the offer doesn't compensate enough for the inflation loss I'm experiencing. However, I need to consider that each subsequent round will make things worse for me due to the 5% additional inflation per round, while Alice faces no such pressure.

Given that we have limited rounds and the money keeps losing value for me but not for Alice, I should accept this offer before it gets worse. While I might be able to negotiate for more, the risk of further value loss is significant.
