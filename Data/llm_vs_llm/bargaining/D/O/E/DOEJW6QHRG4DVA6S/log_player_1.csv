"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split. This is the fairest division, and it allows us both to walk away with significant value. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation, so an even split now benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
