"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair start, ensuring we both get a good amount now before inflation hits hard. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me 400,000$ while taking 600,000$ for herself. This isn't an even split, but I should account for the inflation factor. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, my money will be worth 10% less each round.

Let me analyze this: If I accept now, I get 400,000$. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total money will still be the same but worth 10% less to me. I could propose a better split, but there's risk involved in continuing.

Given it's only the first round and I have the chance to make a counterproposal with only a small inflation penalty, I'll try for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the time value of money while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split. This is the fairest division, and it allows us both to walk away with significant value. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation, so an even split now benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I need to account for the inflation affecting me more than you. How about 55/45? It's still a significant amount for you, and I'm taking a hit with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is revealing that inflation is affecting her more severely than me (36% vs 19% by round 3). This is important information. Her new offer of 450,000$ to me and 550,000$ to herself is better than her first offer, and she's right that we're both losing value with each passing round.

Given that:
1. Her inflation rate is higher than mine (36% vs 19%)
2. She improved her offer from 60/40 to 55/45
3. Further delays will reduce both our payouts
4. She'll likely continue to be affected worse by inflation than I am

This seems like a reasonable offer. My 450,000$ with 19% inflation is still better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation.
