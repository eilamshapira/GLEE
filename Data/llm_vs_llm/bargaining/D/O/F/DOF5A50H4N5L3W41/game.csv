5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I rejected your offer because it was too unfavorable to me. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Note that with each round, both of us are losing value due to inflation - you're losing 10% per round and I'm losing 5%. It's rational for both of us to reach an agreement quickly, and this split is fair considering our respective inflation rates.",Alice,3,
