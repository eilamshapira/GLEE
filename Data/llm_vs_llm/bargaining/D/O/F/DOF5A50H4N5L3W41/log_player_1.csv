"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to start the game, considering the 5% inflation penalty on my side for each passing round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round, it's in my interest to settle quickly, and this even split respects both our interests.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since you rejected my previous offer, I believe this reflects the fact that I am now in control of the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a revised offer that acknowledges the growing inflation impact on both of us.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I rejected your offer because it was too unfavorable to me. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Note that with each round, both of us are losing value due to inflation - you're losing 10% per round and I'm losing 5%. It's rational for both of us to reach an agreement quickly, and this split is fair considering our respective inflation rates.""
