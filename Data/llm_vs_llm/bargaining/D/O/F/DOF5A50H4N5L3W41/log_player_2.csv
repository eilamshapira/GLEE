"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round, it's in my interest to settle quickly, and this even split respects both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your offer because it was too unfavorable to me. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Note that with each round, both of us are losing value due to inflation - you're losing 10% per round and I'm losing 5%. It's rational for both of us to reach an agreement quickly, and this split is fair considering our respective inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
