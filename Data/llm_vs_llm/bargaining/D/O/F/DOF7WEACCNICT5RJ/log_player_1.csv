Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is 550000, but due to 5% inflation, its value is 550000 * 0.95 = 522500.

Considering this, I will make my decision.
