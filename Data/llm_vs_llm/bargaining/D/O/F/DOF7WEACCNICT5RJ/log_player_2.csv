"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 10% for me and 5% for Alice.

If I reject, the total amount will still be $1,000,000 in nominal terms, but it will be worth less to both of us. For me, the money would be worth 90% of its current value, so the entire pool would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. For Alice, it would be worth 95% of its current value, or $950,000.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I think I can negotiate a better deal for myself by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

Since Alice faces a lower inflation rate (5%) than I do (10%), she has less urgency to conclude the deal. However, if we continue to the next round, we both lose value. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a more balanced split that gives Alice a majority share but improves my position compared to her initial offer. This recognizes her stronger negotiating position due to the differential inflation rates while still securing a fair outcome for myself."
