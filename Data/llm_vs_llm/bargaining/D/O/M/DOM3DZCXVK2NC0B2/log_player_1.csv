"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair offer that also acknowledges the inflation effect that I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round if we don't reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
