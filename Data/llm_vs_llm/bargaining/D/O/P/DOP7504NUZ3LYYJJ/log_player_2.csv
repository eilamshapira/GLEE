"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 385224 
# Alice gain: 614776 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me about 38.5% of the total
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - She might reject my offer
4. With higher inflation on my side, waiting too long puts me at a disadvantage
5. While the split isn't 50-50, it's not terrible considering the inflation asymmetry

Given that I face higher inflation (20% vs 10%) and we only have 12 rounds, accepting a decent offer early might be better than risking a negotiation war where I lose more value each round.
