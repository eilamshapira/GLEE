"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, here's my offer: I propose taking $6000 for myself and giving you $4000. I believe this is fair considering the effort I've put in. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer of $4000 out of the $10,000, or reject and make my own proposal in the next round.

While $4000 is a significant amount, Alice is proposing to take 60% of the total for herself. Since there's no context suggesting Alice deserves a larger share (the ""effort"" she mentions isn't explained), a more equal split would be fair in this scenario.

By rejecting, I can make my own proposal in the next round, potentially for a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being reasonable in my approach.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest approach since we both appear to be equal participants in this game. This way we both get $5,000 and can walk away satisfied with an equal division.""}"
