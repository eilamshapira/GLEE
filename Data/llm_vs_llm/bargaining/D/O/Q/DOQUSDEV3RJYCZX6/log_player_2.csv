"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, given the 10% inflation that affects me each round.

Alice is offering a 50-50 split of $10,000, so $5,000 for each of us. If I reject this and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will be worth 10% less (so the $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to me). 

If I accept now, I get $5,000. If I reject and try for more in the next round, even if I got more of the pie, the entire pie is smaller from my perspective.
