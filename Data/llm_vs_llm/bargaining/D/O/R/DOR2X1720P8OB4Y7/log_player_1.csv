"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: More reasonable split, considering inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

For Bob, the money is worth 5% less, but that doesn't affect my decision directly.

Given that my initial offer was 60/40 in my favor, and now Bob is offering 45/55 in his favor, I'm not inclined to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 10% less than in Round 2, which was already 10% less than in Round 1. So, the total decrease in value for me is 10% + 10% = 20% (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.19). For Bob, the total decrease in value is 5% + 5% = 10% (1 - 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.0975).

To make my offer more attractive, I'll aim for a split that's more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still takes into account the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, considering the decreasing value""}"
