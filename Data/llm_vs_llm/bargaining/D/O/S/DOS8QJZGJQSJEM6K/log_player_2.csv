"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 20% depreciation per round for me versus only 5% for Alice, I'm at a bigger disadvantage if we delay. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better split given this asymmetric pressure.

$5000 now is better than a potentially larger amount later that would be worth less due to the steep 20% depreciation rate.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation would erode the value significantly for me, and we might end up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

$5000 is a fair offer and getting it now before any depreciation is probably optimal for me.
