1.0,99.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $1 and you get $99. I know it may seem lopsided, but remember that every round we delay, my $100 loses 20% of its value while yours remain as is. By accepting now, you secure almost the full $100, whereas any postponement will only further hurt my position. I hope we can agree to this quick finish!",Alice,1,
