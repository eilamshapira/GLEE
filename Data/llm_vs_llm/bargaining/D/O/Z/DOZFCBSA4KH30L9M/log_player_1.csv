"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1, ""bob_gain"": 99, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $1 and you get $99. I know it may seem lopsided, but remember that every round we delay, my $100 loses 20% of its value while yours remain as is. By accepting now, you secure almost the full $100, whereas any postponement will only further hurt my position. I hope we can agree to this quick finish!""}"
