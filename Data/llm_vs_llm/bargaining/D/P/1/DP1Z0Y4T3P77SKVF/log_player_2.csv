"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

This is a more balanced offer where I get $480,000 and Alice gets $520,000. It's close to a 50-50 split while still giving Alice a small advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by $20,000 compared to her first proposal ($420,000 vs $400,000). While this is movement in the right direction, we still have several rounds left to negotiate, and I believe we can reach a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain a relatively fair split.

{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000}

I'm proposing I get $470,000 and Alice gets $530,000. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the split reasonably balanced."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is slowly increasing her offers ($400K → $420K → $430K), but the progress is quite slow and we're already in round 5 of 12. While there's still time to negotiate, the risk is increasing. However, I believe there's still room for a better deal given we have 7 rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now halfway through the rounds and Alice has shown a pattern of gradual increases, I'll adjust my offer to show more willingness to compromise while still seeking a fair outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000}

I'm proposing I get $460,000 and Alice gets $540,000. This represents another step towards meeting in the middle, showing continued flexibility while maintaining a reasonable position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues her pattern of increasing offers by $10,000 each time ($430K → $440K). We're now in round 7 of 12, so we've used more than half our rounds. While I believe there might still be room for improvement, the risk of ending up with nothing is increasing. However, given her pattern of consistent increases, I think there's still opportunity for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only 4 rounds remaining after this one, I need to show more significant movement toward a compromise to increase chances of reaching an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing I get $450,000 and Alice gets $550,000. This is a more substantial concession from my previous offer, moving closer to Alice's last proposal. It represents a fair compromise while still maintaining a reasonable position, and shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement as we enter the final rounds."
