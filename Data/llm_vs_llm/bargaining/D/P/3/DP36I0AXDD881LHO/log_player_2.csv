Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is affecting us both, but it's hitting you harder. I think a 65-35 split is reasonable now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, trying to pressure me into accepting a worse deal. It's risky, but I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to accept the 60/40 split you originally offered.  Let's close this out before the money loses more value.""}
