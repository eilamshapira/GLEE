Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a reasonable split to get us both some value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm proposing an even split, which I think is the most logical way to start.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
