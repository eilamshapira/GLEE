"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. However, I also want to be fair to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```
This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
