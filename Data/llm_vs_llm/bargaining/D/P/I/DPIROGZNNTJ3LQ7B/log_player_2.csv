"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount of money. I know that:
1. I have the power to make a counter-offer next round
2. There's no inflation effect on my side
3. We have 11 more rounds if I reject
4. If we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing

However, $400,000 is a significant sum, and there's always the risk that future negotiations might break down. While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable first offer that gives me a substantial portion.
