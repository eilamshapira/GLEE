"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. I'll take 60 and you get 40. It's a good deal considering the time limit and inflation working against you! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
* Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
* If I reject and propose next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me
* However, $40 is less than a fair split, and Alice knows I'm under inflation pressure
* In the next round, I could offer a more equitable split and Alice might accept to avoid further rounds

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but acknowledge the time pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid losing value through more rounds of negotiation.""}"
