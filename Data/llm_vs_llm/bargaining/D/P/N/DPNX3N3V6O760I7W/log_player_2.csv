"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which might seem reasonable at first glance. However, due to the 10% inflation penalty per round, if I accept now, I'll get the full value of my $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I get more money in absolute terms, it will be worth less due to inflation.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds. Also, the first offer being fair suggests Alice might be a reasonable negotiator.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing, accepting a fair split in the first round seems like the best strategy.
