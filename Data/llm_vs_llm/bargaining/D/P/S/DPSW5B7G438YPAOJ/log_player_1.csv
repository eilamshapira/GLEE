"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $4500 is now worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me.
I'll compare this to what I could potentially get in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% less in round 1 and another 5% less in round 2).

To calculate the actual values:
My gain will be worth 0.8 (1 - 0.2) of the proposed amount.
Bob's gain will be worth 0.9 (1 - 0.1) of the proposed amount.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
