"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
