"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'm offering $5500, knowing the clock is ticking. This is a good start for both of us, given the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, keeping $5500 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my next round's money will be worth less
4. $4500 now is better than $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 next round
5. Still, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer
6. The split is currently 45%-55% in Alice's favor, which isn't quite fair

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is more balanced than Alice's initial offer
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face 5% inflation on her next proposal
3. The message emphasizes fairness and urgency to encourage acceptance
4. $4800 for Alice is still a substantial amount, and better than risking further inflation"
