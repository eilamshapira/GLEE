"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split that gives you a substantial amount of $450000. Since you face a 10% inflation penalty per round, it's in your best interest to accept now rather than delay, as your purchasing power would decrease if we continue to another round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the 10% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) while taking $550,000 (55%).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less. So even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $450,000 to make up for the inflation penalty.

Since $450,000 is a substantial amount and rejecting would mean losing 10% of the money's value for me, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
