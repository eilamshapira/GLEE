4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be practical. The inflation rates (10% per round for you vs 5% for me) mean that delay hurts you more than me. This 55-45 split is fair considering our positions. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value but you lose more.",Bob,4,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, let's reach a fair agreement. I've moved from my previous position to meet you closer to the middle. At this point, your money has lost over 34% of its value while mine has lost only about 19%. Each round makes this gap wider. This 53-47 split is reasonable and avoids further losses for both of us.",Bob,6,
