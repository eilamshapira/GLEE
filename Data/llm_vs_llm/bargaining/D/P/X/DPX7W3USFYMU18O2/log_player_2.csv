"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives her 60% of the money ($6,000) and gives me only 40% ($4,000). This doesn't seem fair since we should have equal bargaining power at the start.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, there will be 5% inflation for me (money worth 95% of original value) and 10% inflation for Alice (money worth 90% of original value). This means Alice is more pressured by time than I am.

I'll reject this offer and make a more favorable proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging our different inflation rates. If we continue negotiating, the total value decreases for both of us, but more quickly for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly more in your favor than my initial proposal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has only improved her offer slightly from 60-40 to 58-42, which is still far from fair. Given our different inflation rates, I'm in a stronger position as time goes on.

With each round, Alice loses value faster than I do (10% per round vs 5% per round). After two rounds, my money is worth 9.75% less while Alice's is worth 19% less.

This trend means I should continue negotiating for a better split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. The inflation rates (10% per round for you vs 5% for me) mean that delay hurts you more than me. This 55-45 split is fair considering our positions. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value but you lose more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, slightly above 55-45 considering initial proposals 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me a 44-56 split, which is still not ideal but slightly improved from her previous offers. She's gradually moving toward the middle.

Given our inflation rates, after 4 rounds my money is worth 18.55% less while Alice's is worth 34.39% less. This significant difference shows the time pressure is affecting Alice much more than me.

Since we still have 7 rounds left and Alice is already feeling substantial pressure from inflation, I'll continue negotiating for a better deal.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, let's reach a fair agreement. I've moved from my previous position to meet you closer to the middle. At this point, your money has lost over 34% of its value while mine has lost only about 19%. Each round makes this gap wider. This 53-47 split is reasonable and avoids further losses for both of us.""}"
