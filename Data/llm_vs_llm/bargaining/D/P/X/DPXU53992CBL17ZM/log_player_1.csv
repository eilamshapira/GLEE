"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll send an offer to Bob for the division of $10,000.

Given that with each passing round, the money's value depreciates by 5% for Bob but not for me, I should consider making a fair initial offer that acknowledges this time pressure for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests equally."
