"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worth our while. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $475,000, but it's worth 10% less to me, so I'll effectively get $475,000 * 0.9 = $427,500.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.
