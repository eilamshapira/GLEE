"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a more equitable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's be reasonable and avoid losing money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
