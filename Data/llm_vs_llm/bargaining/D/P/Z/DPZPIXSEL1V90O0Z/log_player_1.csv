"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I would get $475,000, but with 10% inflation = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob would get $525,000

2. If I reject and make another offer:
   * The next round would have even more inflation (20% for me)
   * We might risk losing more value in prolonged negotiations
   * No guarantee Bob would accept a better offer

Given that:
- The offer is relatively fair (close to 50-50)
- The inflation penalty is already hurting my potential gains
- Further negotiation would lead to even more value loss
- There's risk in continuing
