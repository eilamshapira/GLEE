Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though it's an even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer means the potential gains for both of us decrease.
* **Uncertainty about Alice's Inflation:** We don't know how inflation is affecting Alice's perception of the money. She might be more resistant to accepting offers in later rounds if she's experiencing less severe inflation.

A 50/50 split after two rounds is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
