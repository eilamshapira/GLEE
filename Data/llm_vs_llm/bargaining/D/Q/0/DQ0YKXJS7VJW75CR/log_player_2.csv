"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm willing to gamble that Alice might be more risk-averse than I am.  The inflation factor means time is on my side to a certain extent. Let's see what she counters with."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but time is money Alice!  60/40 lets us both walk away winners.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, my offer is now 45-55 in your favor. Let's settle this before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the devaluation, even if hers is happening faster than I anticipated.  This offer is better than my last, and the longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  Time to take the win."
