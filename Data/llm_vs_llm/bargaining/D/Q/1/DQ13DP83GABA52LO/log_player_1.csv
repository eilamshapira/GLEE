"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, knowing that Bob has time pressure due to the 5% inflation penalty per round. However, I want to make it attractive enough that he might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable split where I get 55% and Bob gets 45%. If Bob rejects, in the next round his share will be worth 5% less to him, so this should be an attractive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob offers me $4500, which is worth full value to me ($4500)
2. Bob takes $5500, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $5225 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - I maintain full value

Since I can make a better offer in the next round and Bob's position weakens due to inflation, I should reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split next time, knowing that Bob's money will be worth even less to him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth 10% less than the initial value. I can use this to my advantage by offering a split that appears similar to before but is actually worse for Bob due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4000, which due to 10% inflation is actually worth $3600 to him. While this is a more aggressive split than my first offer, Bob should consider accepting it because:
1. If he rejects, his money will be worth 15% less in the next round
2. Further delays will continue to weaken his position
3. This is still a substantial amount considering the declining value to him"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $4750, which is worth full value to me ($4750)
2. Bob takes $5250, but due to 14.26% inflation, it's worth $4501.35 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 5 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 19% less
   - I maintain full value

Bob is offering me a better amount than his last offer ($4750 vs $4500), but I'm still in a stronger position. The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's value, and I can make an even better offer in the next round. With each round, Bob's negotiating position weakens considerably.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now we're in round 5, and Bob's money is worth about 19% less to him than in round 1. This gives me significant leverage to make a more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the $3500 is actually worth only about $2835 due to the 19% inflation
2. If he rejects, in the next round his money will be worth about 24% less
3. His negotiating position continues to weaken with each round
4. The absolute loss in value he faces by waiting another round is becoming more significant

Bob should seriously consider accepting this offer as further delays will only deteriorate the real value he receives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $5000, which is worth full value to me ($5000)
2. Bob takes $5000, but due to 22.62% inflation, it's worth only $3869 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 7 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 27% less
   - I maintain full value

While Bob is offering a 50-50 split in nominal terms, I'm still in an increasingly stronger position. The inflation effect is now very significant, and I can make an even better offer in the next round. Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken substantially with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now in round 7, with Bob's money worth about 27% less to him, I can make an even stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the $3000 is actually worth only about $2190 due to the 27% inflation
2. If he rejects, in the next round his money will be worth about 31% less
3. His negotiating position has severely weakened
4. The absolute loss in value he faces by waiting another round is now very significant
5. Further delays will make his position even worse

At this point, Bob should strongly consider accepting this offer because:
- The real value he receives is diminishing rapidly
- Future rounds will only lead to worse outcomes for him
- The compounding inflation effect is becoming severe"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $5250, which is worth full value to me ($5250)
2. Bob takes $4750, but due to 30.17% inflation, it's worth only $3317 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 9 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 34% less
   - I maintain full value

Even though Bob has increased his offer to me, I'm still in an extremely strong position. The inflation effect has severely eroded Bob's bargaining power. In the next round, I can make an even more favorable offer, and Bob's position will be even weaker.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob's money now worth about 34% less to him, I can make an even more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the $2500 is actually worth only about $1650 due to the 34% inflation
2. If he rejects, in the next round his money will be worth about 38% less
3. His negotiating position has become extremely weak
4. The compounding inflation effect is now severe
5. Each additional round represents a significant loss in real value for him

Bob really should accept this offer because:
- Further delay will make his position even more untenable
- The real value he receives is dropping dramatically with each round
- He's approaching a point where any delay makes his final outcome much worse
- This might be his last chance to secure a meaningful amount of value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $5500, which is worth full value to me ($5500)
2. Bob takes $4500, but due to 36.98% inflation, it's worth only $2836 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 11 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 41% less
   - I maintain full value

The inflation effect has severely eroded Bob's position. Even though he's offering me more than before, I can make an even more advantageous offer in the next round where his money will be worth significantly less to him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, with Bob's money worth about 41% less to him, I can make an even stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Bob, the $2000 is actually worth only about $1180 due to the 41% inflation
2. If he rejects, in the next round his money will be worth about 45% less
3. His negotiating position has become extremely weak
4. The compounding inflation effect is devastating at this point
5. Each additional round represents a massive loss in real value for him

Bob absolutely should accept this offer because:
- The real value he receives is now dropping very dramatically with each round
- Future rounds will only make his position more desperate
- We're reaching a point where further delays would make any amount almost worthless to him
- This might be his last chance to secure any meaningful value from this negotiation
- Rejecting this offer would be irrational given how much value he loses with each delay"
