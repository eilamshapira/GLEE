"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair initial offer that gives both of us a good amount while accounting for the risk of future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still offers Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, we'll both risk losing value due to the 20% inflation in the next round."
