"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair split, let's secure a good outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ in the first round
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 5% less
   - But I get to make the next offer

3. Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% vs 5%), delaying is more costly for me than for Alice
4. 400,000$ now is better than potentially getting more later but with significant devaluation

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", 400,000$ is a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a reasonable offer. The asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.
