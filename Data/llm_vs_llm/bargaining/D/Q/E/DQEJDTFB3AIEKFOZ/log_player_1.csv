"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (with the assumption that Bob’s money is discounted by a factor of 0.9 per extra round while mine is not discounted), here’s one way to reason about the “subgame perfect equilibrium” offer in round 1:

• Imagine that if we reached round 12 (with Bob proposing) Bob could “take everything” (offering Alice nothing); but by that time Bob’s dollars would be worth 0.9^(11) of their face‐value.  
• Then moving backward one round at a time (with each proposer offering the other just enough so that the other is indifferent between accepting now or waiting one more round—keeping in mind Bob’s discounting and my full‐value dollars), one finds that in round 1 (with me proposing) Bob’s “reservation” is about 100 × 0.9 = 90% of what he could nominally get in round 2.  
• Working through the rounds the equilibrium division at round 1 turns out approximately to be: Bob receives about 53.14 dollars and I keep about 46.86 dollars.  

Thus, in round 1 my equilibrium offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 46.86, ""bob_gain"": 53.14}

(The exact numbers might vary slightly with more precise rounding, but this is one equilibrium outcome consistent with the discount factors.)"
