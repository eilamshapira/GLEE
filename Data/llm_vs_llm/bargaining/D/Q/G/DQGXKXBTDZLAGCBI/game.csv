500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delaying isn't good for me, and likely not for you either. This even split ensures we both walk away with substantial value right now.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but let's be realistic. I'm willing to agree on a 55/45 split, considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose with further delays.  This offer ensures you still get a good deal.",Alice,3,
