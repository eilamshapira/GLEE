Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delaying isn't good for me, and likely not for you either. This even split ensures we both walk away with substantial value right now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
