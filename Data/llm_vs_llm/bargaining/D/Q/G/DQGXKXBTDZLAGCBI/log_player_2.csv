"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this quickly. A 60/40 split seems fair for a first offer. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $900,000. A fair split of that would be $450,000, which is more than I'm offered now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delaying isn't good for me, and likely not for you either. This even split ensures we both walk away with substantial value right now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but let's be realistic. I'm willing to agree on a 55/45 split, considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose with further delays.  This offer ensures you still get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is a 45% share.

Due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth 19% less to me than it would have been in round 1, so the effective value to me is $450,000 × 0.81 = $364,500.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (about 27% from round 1), which would make the money worth even less to me. Even if I managed to negotiate a 50/50 split in the next round, I'd get $500,000 × 0.73 = $365,000, which is only slightly better than accepting now.

Given the diminishing returns and the risk of further rejection, I should accept this offer.
