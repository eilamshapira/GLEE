I propose a 99/1 split in my favor, taking 990,000 and leaving Bob with 10,000. It's a large offer for him, but I want to secure the majority share early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 999999 
# Bob gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
