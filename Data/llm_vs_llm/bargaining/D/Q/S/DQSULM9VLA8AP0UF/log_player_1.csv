"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, considering the devaluation I will face in subsequent rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning is that this gives me a slight edge, accounting for the potential loss in value I face if we go to future rounds. Bob still gets a significant amount. Hopefully, he will find this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

That's an absurdly unfair offer. Even with the devaluation, 1 dollar is unacceptable. I'd rather risk further rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remembering that the money is now worth 10% less to me than in round 1 (5% per round * 2 rounds) if I were to receive it in a later round. Let's try a more balanced approach but still favoring myself a bit, given the risk I am taking with the devaluation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Absolutely not. This is a ridiculous offer. I will continue to reject such blatant attempts to take everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 18.55% less to me than in round 1. Bob is clearly trying to push me to the limit. I need to make an offer that's more likely to be accepted, but still gives me a decent amount, considering the diminishing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is getting tiresome. Still rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 26.49% less to me than in round 1. Bob is clearly being unreasonable, but I need to try and salvage something.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Absolutely not!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, this is getting desperate. The money is now worth 33.65% less. I need to make a very appealing offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
