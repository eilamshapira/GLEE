"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that time pressure from inflation affects me. I want to start with a reasonable split that Bob is likely to accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a somewhat balanced split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but should still be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where my potential gain would be devalued by 10%."
