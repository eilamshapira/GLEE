"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'd like to make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation effect I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this slightly higher split for myself to offset some of the inflation risk I face if we go to further rounds. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage if negotiations extend."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
