"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the devaluation. This offer gives you a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze the offer considering the devaluation.

*   **Alice's offer:** Bob gets $40, Alice gets $60.
*   **Devaluation:** Money is worth 20% less to Bob and 10% less to Alice each round.
*   **Current Round:** Round 1

In this round, the devaluation hasn't taken effect yet. So, $40 now is better than a smaller amount later after devaluation.

I will accept this offer.
