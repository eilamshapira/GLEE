"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's work together to avoid losing too much value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45 with 5% inflation = $42.75 real value
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - Any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
   - Even if I got $60, it would be worth $54 after 10% inflation
   - And Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given this, I should accept Bob's offer now since $42.75 is better than risking further inflation losses.
