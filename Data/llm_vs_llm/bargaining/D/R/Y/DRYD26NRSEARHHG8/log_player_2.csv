"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle things now. I get $1687.20 and you get $8312.80. If you wait another round the pie will shrink for me by 20% and even though your loss is only 5% per round, the ensuing bargaining power will force you to concede nearly what you get now. Accepting this division guarantees you a very competitive share compared to what the future holds for you. Let's agree now and avoid further devaluation! 
# Bob gain: 8312.8 
# Alice gain: 1687.2 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
