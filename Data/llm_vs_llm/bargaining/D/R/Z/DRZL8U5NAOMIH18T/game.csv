5000.0,5000.0,"I'm proposing an equal split that's fair to both of us. With inflation affecting future rounds, this is an optimal solution that gives us both equal value right now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, as rounds progress, the value of money diminishes for me due to inflation. In order to finalize quickly and save time for both of us, I'm proposing to receive $6000 and offer you $4000. Let's agree now for our mutual benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects me each round. Since you rejected an even split and tried to take more for yourself, I'm proposing this adjusted split that accounts for the disadvantage I face from inflation. This is still fair considering we've already lost value by extending to round 3.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3200.0,6800.0,"Alice, as we move into round 4, the impact of inflation on your share becomes even more pressing. While my $6800 retains its full value, your $3200—although lower than an equal split—protects you from further devaluation in future rounds. I believe this offer reflects the current realities and is in your best interest to settle now, rather than risk additional losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I notice you're trying to leverage the inflation penalty against me by asking for increasingly larger shares. However, with inflation now at over 14%, I need to propose a division that accounts for this disadvantage. This 60/40 split in my favor helps balance the effective value we each receive. If we continue negotiating, I'll need to ask for even more to offset the growing inflation penalty. Let's conclude this now with a fair resolution that acknowledges the game's constraints.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, as we enter round 6 the impact of inflation on your share increases further, while my portion remains at full value. Continuing to negotiate will only erode the value of your money even more. In order to lock in what little effective value remains for you, I propose a division of $7500 for me and $2500 for you. I believe this is in your best interest under the current circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at 22.62%, my effective gain from the previous offer would only be worth about $1935. You're clearly trying to exploit the inflation penalty to pressure me into accepting less. For us to reach a fair agreement where we both receive similar effective value, I need a larger nominal amount to offset the inflation effect. This 70/30 split helps balance our actual returns. If we continue further, I'll need to ask for even more as inflation increases. Let's end this cycle and agree to a fair resolution now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, by round 8, the inflation is hitting your share even harder—in fact, your money is now worth roughly 35% less than it was at the start. While my portion retains full value, your effective gain continues to erode with every round. To spare you even further devaluation and to close this negotiation now, I'm proposing that I take $8500 and you get $1500. Settling now secures what little effective value remains for you, as any further delay will only worsen the outcome.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at 30.17%, my effective gain from your previous offer would only be worth about $1047. You're continuing to exploit the inflation penalty while offering me less and less real value. To achieve anything close to parity in our effective gains, I need a much larger nominal amount. This 80/20 split helps balance our actual returns given the severe inflation penalty I face. At this point, my $8000 is effectively worth only about $5583, which is far more reasonable. If we don't reach an agreement now, I'll be forced to ask for an even more lopsided split in the next round as inflation continues to reduce my effective gain.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, by round 10 the impact of inflation on your share has grown even more severe. My portion still holds full value, while any delay further erodes what you receive. To prevent additional loss of effective value, I'm proposing a final offer: I take $9000 and you get $1000. Accepting this now preserves the best possible outcome for you given the circumstances.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at nearly 37%, my effective value from your last offer would only be around $630. You've consistently tried to exploit the inflation penalty while refusing any reasonable compromise. At this point, to achieve anything close to fair effective value, I need 90% of the nominal amount. This $9000 for me is effectively worth only about $5670 due to inflation, which is still a reasonable offer for both of us considering the circumstances. This is my final offer - if we continue, I'll be forced to demand even more as inflation continues to erode my share. Let's end this cycle now with a resolution that acknowledges the game's constraints.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Alice, as we move into round 12, it's clear that each additional round further diminishes the effective value of your share, while my portion remains unaffected. To prevent even greater loss of value for you, I'm making a final offer: I take $9500 and you receive $500. Although the nominal amount for you is low, accepting now safeguards you against the deepening inflation penalty. This is the most favorable outcome for you under these conditions, and I urge you to settle now.",Bob,12,
