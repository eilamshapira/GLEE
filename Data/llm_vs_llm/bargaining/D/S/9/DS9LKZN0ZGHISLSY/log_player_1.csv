"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering that any delay will cost me 10% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, I'll lose 10% value in the next round. Bob should recognize that this is a reasonable split that benefits both of us without needing to extend the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept this $500,000 now, due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $450,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less in the next round
3. Bob has no inflation penalty, so they can afford to wait
4. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and what I get will be worth even less

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating.
