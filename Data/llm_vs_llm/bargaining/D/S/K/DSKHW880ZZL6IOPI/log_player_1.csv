"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to be mindful of the declining value of the money with each round. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm aiming for a slightly larger share to start, acknowledging the risk I'm taking by proposing first.
*   I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob will likely accept, considering that the money will be worth significantly less in subsequent rounds if he declines. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a standoff."
