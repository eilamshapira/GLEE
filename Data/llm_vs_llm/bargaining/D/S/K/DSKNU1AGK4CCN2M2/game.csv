550000.0,450000.0,"Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you 450k, which is close to a 50-50 split, considering we both face inflation each round.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I propose a split where I take 550k and you get 450k. This adjusts for the higher rate of inflation you're facing and ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount before it devalues further.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Given that I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%), I need a larger share to compensate for the faster value loss. This split is fair when accounting for our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Considering the rapid devaluation we're both facing, I'm proposing a split of 525k for me and 475k for you. This offer takes into account the higher inflation rate you're experiencing but also ensures that we both get a significant amount before the value drops even more. Let's settle this soon to maximize our gains.",Bob,4,
