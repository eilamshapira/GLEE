"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split considering I'm facing inflation while being uncertain about Bob's inflation situation. Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer that should be attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split as it's reasonably balanced while giving me a slight advantage to help buffer against future inflation if Bob declines. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For me, due to 20% inflation, if I accept:
$450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000 effective value

If I reject and we continue, the next round will have even worse inflation for me (another 20% loss), and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.

While Bob's offer gives him more money, the difference isn't extreme, and given the steep inflation penalty I'm facing (20% per round), it would be risky to reject and hope for a better deal later.
