"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable offer where both of us get a substantial amount, with me getting a moderate advantage of $100,000 for being the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more balanced counteroffer in the next round. A slightly uneven split in Bob's favor isn't optimal when we still have many rounds left to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a perfectly even split to show my willingness to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a completely fair 50-50 split that gives us both an equal share. There's no reason for either of us to get less than the other, and this offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution."
