"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial sum, and there's always a risk in rejecting early reasonable offers.

However, since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds to go, I believe I can try to negotiate for a fairer split. By rejecting this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, and I might be able to secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that's slightly in my favor, but not too aggressive to likely cause a rejection.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

My proposal is reasonable because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split
2. The difference is modest enough that it shouldn't appear greedy
3. It acknowledges that we both need to come to an agreement to get anything"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a perfectly fair 50-50 split, offering each of us $500,000. This is an ideal and equitable outcome, and there's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would lead to a better result for either party. Given that this is a fair offer and we've already gone through two rounds of negotiation, I should accept this proposal.
