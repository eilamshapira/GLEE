"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 20%. Let me evaluate:

If I accept now: I get $5,000
If I reject and propose next round: The $10,000 is worth 20% less to me, so the total pot is effectively worth $8,000 to me. Even if I proposed to take all $10,000 (which Alice would likely reject), the maximum I could get would be $8,000.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting a fair split now is better than risking further depreciation of the money's value.
