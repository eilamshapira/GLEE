5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further delays and protect against rapid inflation on my end, I propose we settle now. I suggest a division where I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This split is fair and ensures that we both receive a significant portion of the available amount without risking additional loss of value. Looking forward to your agreement.",Alice,1,
