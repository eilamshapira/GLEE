"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further delays and protect against rapid inflation on my end, I propose we settle now. I suggest a division where I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This split is fair and ensures that we both receive a significant portion of the available amount without risking additional loss of value. Looking forward to your agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I'm taking a bigger risk by proceeding. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the uncertainty and potential inflation impact. It's still a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
