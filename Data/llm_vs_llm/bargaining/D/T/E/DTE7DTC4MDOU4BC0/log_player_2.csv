"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further delays and protect against rapid inflation on my end, I propose we settle now. I suggest a division where I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This split is fair and ensures that we both receive a significant portion of the available amount without risking additional loss of value. Looking forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
