"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, inflation will reduce the value by 10% in the next round
- $40 now is better than potentially getting $45 but worth 10% less in the next round
- There's also risk of further rounds and eventual zero payout

While 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
