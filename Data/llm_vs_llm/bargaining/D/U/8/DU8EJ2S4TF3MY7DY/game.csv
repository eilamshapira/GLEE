6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to compensate for the inflation risk.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Thanks for your offer Alice, but I think a more equitable split would be better. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. This accounts for the fact that inflation affects me at 5% per round, so I need to protect against that risk. This is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further rounds where both of us lose value.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but it also affects me. This offer is a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I appreciate your adjusted offer, but there's an important point to clarify - the inflation only affects me, not you. The system explicitly told me that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me, while your value remains the same. That's why I need a larger portion to offset this disadvantage. At 5800 for me and 4200 for you, this accounts for the inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens while yours stays strong. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric situation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We both know there's pressure to reach a deal.  This offer is a fair compromise, even considering your claim about inflation.",Alice,5,
