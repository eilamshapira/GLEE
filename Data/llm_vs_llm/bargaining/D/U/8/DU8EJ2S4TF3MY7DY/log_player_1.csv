Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer Alice, but I think a more equitable split would be better. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. This accounts for the fact that inflation affects me at 5% per round, so I need to protect against that risk. This is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further rounds where both of us lose value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your adjusted offer, but there's an important point to clarify - the inflation only affects me, not you. The system explicitly told me that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me, while your value remains the same. That's why I need a larger portion to offset this disadvantage. At 5800 for me and 4200 for you, this accounts for the inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens while yours stays strong. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric situation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob claims the inflation only affects him, this could be a tactic to get a larger share. I'm not willing to accept such a large difference without pushing back further."
