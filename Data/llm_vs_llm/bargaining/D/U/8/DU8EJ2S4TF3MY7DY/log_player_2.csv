"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to compensate for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. Given that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round for me, waiting has a cost.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value for me would already be reduced to $9,500 (95% of the original value). 

Let me make a strategic decision. Since we have 12 rounds total, and this is just the first round, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer Alice, but I think a more equitable split would be better. I'm proposing I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This accounts for the fact that inflation affects me at 5% per round, so I need to protect against that risk. This is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further rounds where both of us lose value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but it also affects me. This offer is a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has increased her offer to me by $300 compared to her first offer. However, due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1. 

Let me calculate the actual value to me: $4,300 × 0.9025 = $3,880.75 in round 1 value.

This is actually less valuable to me than her initial offer would have been ($4,000). Also, Alice mentioned inflation affects her too, but the system information clearly states that inflation only affects me, not Alice.

I think I should reject this offer and try to get a better deal, as we still have several rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your adjusted offer, but there's an important point to clarify - the inflation only affects me, not you. The system explicitly told me that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me, while your value remains the same. That's why I need a larger portion to offset this disadvantage. At 5800 for me and 4200 for you, this accounts for the inflation I've already experienced. If we continue negotiating, my position only weakens while yours stays strong. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both know there's pressure to reach a deal.  This offer is a fair compromise, even considering your claim about inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $4,500, but with 18.55% inflation, the real value to me is:
$4,500 × 0.8145 = $3,665.25 in round 1 value.

This is still less than her initial offer's value of $4,000. Alice seems to be using the inflation to her advantage, knowing that the longer we negotiate, the worse my position becomes.

We're now in round 5 of 12. If we continue much longer, the inflation will significantly erode any gains I might receive. Given the asymmetric inflation that only affects me, and the fact that we're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation window, I should accept this offer before my position weakens further.
