550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need a bit more to offset my future losses if we drag this out. This way we both walk away with a good amount right now without risking further devaluation.",Alice,1,
