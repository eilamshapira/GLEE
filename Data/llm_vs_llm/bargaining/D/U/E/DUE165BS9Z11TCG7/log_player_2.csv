"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 5000-5000 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation per round that affects me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me will be 10% less, meaning the $10,000 is effectively worth $9,000 to me. If I want to maximize my outcome, I should consider whether I can get more than $5,000 in the next round, accounting for inflation.

Given that a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and rejecting would devalue the total pot for me, I'll accept this offer.
