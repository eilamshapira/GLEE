"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which seems quite unfair. Considering that the value of money decreases by 10% for me in each round, I should make a counterproposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division, considering the 10% inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, as we each get half of the total amount. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This proposal respects both our interests while being equitable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $1000 to $2000, but this is still quite uneven. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. The $2000 is now worth about $1620 to me due to the 19% inflation penalty I face.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face a 27.1% total inflation penalty (1 - 0.9³), further reducing the value of any money I receive. Waiting another round would significantly diminish my potential gains.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing inflation penalty I face, I'll propose a more pragmatic division that accounts for our different positions while still giving me a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing a division where I receive $4500 and Alice receives $5500. This acknowledges the stronger negotiating position Alice has due to the inflation that only affects me. With each round, my purchasing power decreases, so reaching an agreement now is in my interest. This offer is still reasonable and gives Alice a slight advantage while ensuring I receive a substantial portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $2000 to $3000, but I need to consider the significant inflation penalty I now face. The $3000 is worth only about $1968 to me after the 34.39% inflation penalty.

If I reject and continue to the next round, the inflation penalty will increase to about 41% (1 - 0.9⁵), further reducing the value of any money I receive. The trend suggests Alice is gradually increasing her offers, but time is working against me.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of further devaluation, accepting this offer is now the better strategic choice.
