500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle this fairly from the start. I propose an equal split â€“ $500K each. Accepting this offer now prevents any further loss in my share from inflation (which reduces my money by 10% each round) and ensures that both of us secure our gains immediately. I believe this is a reasonable and fair solution for us both. What do you think?",Alice,1,
