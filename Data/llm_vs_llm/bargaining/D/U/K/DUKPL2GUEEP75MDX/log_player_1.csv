"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for both me and Bob with each passing round. In the first round, the inflation isn't too severe, so I'll aim for a significant portion while still making it appealing for Bob to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze this carefully.

*   **Bob's offer:** $500,000 for me, $500,000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth 5% less than round 1.

Let's consider the alternatives. If I reject, I get to make an offer in round 3, but my money will be worth another 20% less *on top* of the existing 20% loss. This means round 3 money will only be worth 64% of the original amount.

Bob's offer of $500,000, with a 20% loss, is worth $400,000 in original round 1 value.
If I reject, and even manage to swing a 60/40 split for myself in round 3, that's 60% of $1,000,000, which is $600,000, but that is worth 64% of its value due to two rounds of inflation: $384,000.
The offer is better than what I would likely get.
