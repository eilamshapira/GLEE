"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the dwindling value of the money for him with each round. Given that this is the first round, I'll try to make a reasonable, but slightly advantageous offer for myself, hoping he'll accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is a straight 50/50 split. While I initially aimed for a slightly larger share, considering the inflation impacting Bob and the fact that it's only round 2, accepting this offer guarantees me $5000. If I reject, the risk is that Bob will offer less in subsequent rounds due to increasing inflation on his side. Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
