83.0,17.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a division where I take $83 and you receive $17. Given that each subsequent round diminishes our money's value (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting this offer now is beneficial for both of us. I believe this is fair and efficient—let's avoid the inflation penalty and settle now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor. My money loses value faster. This is still a good deal for you compared to waiting.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the division you propose leaves me with only $40 (worth $38 after discount) compared to what I can secure by proposing in the next round. Given that I can secure a much better deal by waiting—especially since my money loses value less rapidly than yours—I must reject your offer.",Alice,2,reject
95.0,5.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes have dropped further—in my case to about 90% and in yours to about 64% of the original value. If you wait until round 4, your effective value will be very low since your discounting is harsh (around 0.512 of any dollar then) and you'll have to give almost everything to me in the next round. To avoid that painful loss, I propose to split the $100 as $95 for me and $5 for you. This gives you an effective value of about $5 × 0.64 = $3.20 today—clearly better than the continuation value you’d face by waiting another round. I hope you agree that settling now is in both our best interests.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, this is the last chance for a reasonable deal. My money is losing value fast. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or leave it. The value of waiting for you is way less than for me.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer, but it's not acceptable. With your 70/30 split, I'm slated to receive $30, and after the 14.26% discount that gives me approximately $25.72 in effective value. If I reject your offer, I get to propose in the next round where my discount factor will be about 0.8145, allowing me to claim nearly the entire $100 (practically all the value still available to me) by offering you only a token amount that you'd rationally accept rather than face even harsher devaluation. In short, my alternative in round 5 far exceeds the effective value of your current proposal, so I must reject.",Alice,4,reject
83.0,17.0,"Bob, here's my offer in round 5. Given that in this round each dollar for me is worth about 0.8145 of its round‐1 value and each dollar for you is worth about 0.4096, your nominal $17 translates to roughly $6.96 in round‐1 terms. If you were to reject my offer, you'd become the proposer in round 6—but even then, with your harsher discounting (each dollar then worth about 0.3277), your best equilibrium nominal gain would be around $20.83, which converts to roughly $6.82 effective. Since $6.96 exceeds that continuation value, I believe this offer is rational for you to accept. Let's settle now and avoid further loss from inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, this is the last offer I am going to make. My money is almost worthless at this point. I need 80 and you get 20. This is the best you will get.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand that your money is devaluing rapidly and this is your final offer. Although I end up with only $20 nominally, which at 22.62% devaluation is about $15.48 in first‐round value, rejecting the deal would leave me with nothing. Given the harsh discounting that would occur if we proceeded further, I must accept your offer to secure a positive outcome.",Alice,6,accept
