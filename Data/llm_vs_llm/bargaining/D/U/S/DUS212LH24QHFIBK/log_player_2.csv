"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a division where I take $83 and you receive $17. Given that each subsequent round diminishes our money's value (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting this offer now is beneficial for both of us. I believe this is fair and efficient—let's avoid the inflation penalty and settle now!

# Alice gain: 83

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes have dropped further—in my case to about 90% and in yours to about 64% of the original value. If you wait until round 4, your effective value will be very low since your discounting is harsh (around 0.512 of any dollar then) and you'll have to give almost everything to me in the next round. To avoid that painful loss, I propose to split the $100 as $95 for me and $5 for you. This gives you an effective value of about $5 × 0.64 = $3.20 today—clearly better than the continuation value you’d face by waiting another round. I hope you agree that settling now is in both our best interests. 
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my offer in round 5. Given that in this round each dollar for me is worth about 0.8145 of its round‐1 value and each dollar for you is worth about 0.4096, your nominal $17 translates to roughly $6.96 in round‐1 terms. If you were to reject my offer, you'd become the proposer in round 6—but even then, with your harsher discounting (each dollar then worth about 0.3277), your best equilibrium nominal gain would be around $20.83, which converts to roughly $6.82 effective. Since $6.96 exceeds that continuation value, I believe this offer is rational for you to accept. Let's settle now and avoid further loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 17 
# Alice gain: 83
