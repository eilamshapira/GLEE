Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""My turn, let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. It's more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable.  I'll propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $50 would be worth approximately $32 (100 - 36% = 64, and 50 * 0.64 = 32). However, since Alice's gain is only worth 9.75% less, her $50 would still be worth around $45.25. Given this, a 50/50 split doesn't seem as fair as it initially appears.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, so I need a better split to make it worth my while. 70/30 seems more reasonable now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, inflation is affecting us both. Let's compromise.  I'll go back to a 45/55 split in your favor, but I need something.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $55 would be worth approximately $22.58 (100 - 59.04% = 40.96, and 55 * 0.4096 = 22.58). On the other hand, Alice's $45 would be worth around $36.67 (100 - 18.55% = 81.45, and 45 * 0.8145 = 36.67). Given the significant difference in value due to inflation, I should consider accepting this offer to get something rather than risking further devaluation.
