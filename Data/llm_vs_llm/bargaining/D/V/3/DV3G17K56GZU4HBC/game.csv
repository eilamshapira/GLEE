200000.0,800000.0,"I propose that I get $200000 and you get $800000. This is a fair offer considering that money devalues 20% for you each round. If we go to the next round, your $800000 would only be worth $640000 to you. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"I propose we split the money equally. Although the money devalues for me, I prefer to be fair. If we proceed to the next round, I would only value my share at $400000, but you would still get $500000. Let's avoid further devaluation for me and settle this now.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's be strategic. The money is now worth 36% less to you after two rounds of inflation (20% + another 20% of the remaining 80%). If we go to round 4, it would be worth even less to you. My offer of $600000 for you and $400000 for me is actually more valuable to you now than waiting another round. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect.",Alice,3,
