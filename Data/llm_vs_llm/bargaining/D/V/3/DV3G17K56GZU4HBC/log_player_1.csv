"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, 
""bob_gain"": 800000, 
""message"": ""I propose that I get $200,000 and you get $800,000. This is a fair offer considering that money devalues 20% for you each round. If we go to the next round, your $800,000 would only be worth $640,000 to you. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally. Although the money devalues for me, I prefer to be fair. If we proceed to the next round, I would only value my share at $400000, but you would still get $500000. Let's avoid further devaluation for me and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's be strategic. The money is now worth 36% less to you after two rounds of inflation (20% + another 20% of the remaining 80%). If we go to round 4, it would be worth even less to you. My offer of $600,000 for you and $400,000 for me is actually more valuable to you now than waiting another round. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect.""}"
