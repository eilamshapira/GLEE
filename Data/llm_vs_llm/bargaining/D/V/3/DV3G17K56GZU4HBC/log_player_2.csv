"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose that I get $200000 and you get $800000. This is a fair offer considering that money devalues 20% for you each round. If we go to the next round, your $800000 would only be worth $640000 to you. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money equally. Although the money devalues for me, I prefer to be fair. If we proceed to the next round, I would only value my share at $400,000, but you would still get $500,000. Let's avoid further devaluation for me and settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's be strategic. The money is now worth 36% less to you after two rounds of inflation (20% + another 20% of the remaining 80%). If we go to round 4, it would be worth even less to you. My offer of $600000 for you and $400000 for me is actually more valuable to you now than waiting another round. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
