"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she's taking $60. Since this is only the first round and I face a 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject, I should evaluate if waiting for a better deal is worth it.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I'll face a 5% inflation penalty, making the $100 effectively worth $95 to me. I could potentially get more than $40, but I also risk ending up with less if we continue disagreeing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's reasonable while acknowledging the inflation penalty I'm facing. Since the money is worth 5% less to me this round, I need to account for that in my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. This gives Alice the same amount as she would get if we accept this offer and end the game now, rather than continuing with more rounds where the total value decreases for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this new offer. Alice has slightly improved her offer from $40 to $41 for me, but I'm now facing a 9.75% inflation penalty compared to round 1.

If I reject and we move to round 4, the money will be worth even less to me due to the increasing inflation penalty, while Alice faces no such penalty. She's only increased her offer by $1, which doesn't seem to adequately account for the inflation I'm facing.

Let me calculate: $41 with a 9.75% penalty is effectively worth about $37 compared to round 1 value. If I wait another round, the penalty increases further.

Given the increasing inflation penalty and the minimal improvement in Alice's offer, I should accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
