"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for potential future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer accounts for some inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your move towards the middle.  This is a bit closer to my initial offer to reflect that time is valuable (due to inflation). 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the pace is too slow.  The impact of inflation is becoming significant, and it's in my best interest to secure a reasonable deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice. This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally showing a willingness to compromise significantly. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share before inflation further erodes the value.  Delaying further carries too much risk at this point."
