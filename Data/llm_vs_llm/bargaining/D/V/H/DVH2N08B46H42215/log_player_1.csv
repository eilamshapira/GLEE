"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation effects and Bob's previous offer, I'll adjust my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900}

I propose $5,100 for me and $4,900 for Bob. This is still close to an even split, but accounts for the fact that I'm losing value with each round due to inflation. This offer is only slightly better for me than an even split, and still gives Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, but we need to find a compromise before inflation erodes too much value.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm returning to an even 50-50 split of $5,000 each. With inflation already reducing my gains by more than 14%, I'm proposing this fair division to reach an agreement. This balanced approach should be acceptable to both of us and prevent further value loss from continued rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
