"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll account for the inflation I'll experience in later rounds. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable offer for myself, anticipating that I might need to concede more later due to the inflation. Bob gets a fair amount, which hopefully encourages him to accept early."
