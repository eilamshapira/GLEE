"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that she gets $60 and I get $40 out of the $100.

If I reject and move to the next round, I'll be able to make my own proposal, but due to inflation, the $100 will be worth 10% less to me (so effectively $90 total value from my perspective).

This offer gives me $40 right now, which is less than half. If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, but I need to account for the 10% inflation on my end.

Given that I'd only have $90 of value to work with in the next round due to inflation, and I'd need to offer Alice something she'd accept, I don't think I can significantly improve my position.
