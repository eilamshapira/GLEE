"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60/40 split where I would receive $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round due to inflation. That means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. Even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, I need to factor in this depreciation.

While a 50/50 split would give me $500,000, rejecting this offer means I'd need to secure more than 42.1% of the money in the next round just to break even with what I'm being offered now ($400,000). Given the uncertainty and the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
