"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a slightly favorable split for me, recognizing the impact of inflation on my share in later rounds.  Let's settle this now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, the inflation effect hasn't kicked in yet for me. Considering Alice's offer, I get $475,000, which is less than half, but it's a guaranteed amount. If I reject this offer, I risk losing 5% of the total amount in the next round, which would be $50,000. 

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's possible that she's trying to make a reasonable offer to avoid losing value in later rounds as well. However, I'm not sure if this split is the best I can get.

For now, I think it's reasonable to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation effect will reduce the value for me, not for Alice (as far as I know).

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation effect, the total amount is still $1,000,000 for Alice, but for me, it's effectively less due to the 5% reduction. 

To calculate my effective amount after the first round: $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself, hoping Alice will accept it to avoid further reductions.

My offer: 
{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this now, considering the inflation impact on my share. This split seems reasonable, given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting me harder each round. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's avoid further losses and agree now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer, and now she's making a new proposal, I need to consider the updated situation.

The total amount is still $1,000,000, but due to the inflation effect, my share is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. This means that if I were to get $450,000, its value to me would be:

$450,000 / (1 - 0.0975) = $450,000 / 0.9025 â‰ˆ $498,901 (in terms of the original value)

However, since Alice's offer gives me $450,000, and I'm considering its reduced value due to inflation, I should compare it to what I could potentially get in the next round.

If I reject this offer, the inflation effect will reduce the value further. In the next round, the total amount would be worth approximately $1,000,000 * 0.95^3 = $857,375 (in terms of the original value) to me.

Considering Alice's message, it seems she's also feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer, although not in my favor, might be a sign that she's willing to negotiate.

Given the decreasing value of the money and the potential risks of further negotiations, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer, as it guarantees me a significant amount, even if it's not the most favorable split.
