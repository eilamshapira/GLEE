"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my $400,000 would be worth:
   - Next round: $380,000
   - Two rounds later: $361,000
   And so on...

While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation eating into my share. If I reject, Alice might be even less generous in later rounds, knowing I'm affected by inflation.
