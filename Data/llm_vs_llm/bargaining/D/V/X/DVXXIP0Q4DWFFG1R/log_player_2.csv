"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it, taking into account the inflation factor that affects my share.

In the first round, the total amount available is $10,000, and Alice's offer gives me $4,750. If I reject this offer, I'll have the chance to make a counteroffer in the next round, but my share will be worth 20% less due to inflation.

Given that the inflation rate is 20%, if I were to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the maximum amount I could potentially get (assuming I could negotiate for the entire remaining amount after Alice's share in the next round) would be less valuable to me due to inflation.

Considering this, accepting an offer that gives me nearly half of the total amount might be a reasonable strategy, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Alice's perception of the value.
