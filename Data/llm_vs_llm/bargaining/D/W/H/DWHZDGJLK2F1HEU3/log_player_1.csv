This offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round that passes. I'm willing to meet you halfway here. This offer is fair and lets us both walk away with a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is not ideal with the inflation working against me, but it's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing in the later rounds. Bob is clearly trying to maximize his gains, and waiting any longer might result in even worse offers."
