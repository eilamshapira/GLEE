"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the diminishing value of the money for both of us with each round. Since this is round 1, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now he's proposing $45 for me and $55 for himself. Considering the inflation, let's analyze:

*   **My Perspective:** $45 now is the same value as $45 in round 1.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** $55 now is worth 10% less to him than it would have been in round 1. That means it's worth $55 * 0.9 = $49.50 in round 1 terms.

I need to consider that if I reject this, the money will be worth even less in the next round. While I'd prefer more, $45 isn't terrible, and the risk of getting less later is real.
