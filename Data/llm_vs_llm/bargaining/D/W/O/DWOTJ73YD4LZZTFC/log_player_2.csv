"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000. This is a 40-60 split in her favor.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. I would then make the next offer.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject now and propose a better deal next round, I'd need to get more than $4,210.53 (which is $4,000 รท 0.95) to come out ahead after accounting for the 5% inflation.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and that I still get a substantial portion ($4,000) with this offer, I'll accept it rather than risk further negotiations with decreasing value.
