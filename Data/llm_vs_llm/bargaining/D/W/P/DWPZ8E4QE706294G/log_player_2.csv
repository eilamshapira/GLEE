Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is getting close to a tipping point, it's still in my best interest to reject. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Accepting $4500 now is significantly worse than getting a slightly better deal in the next round.
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice knows the money is losing value for me. She's likely to propose increasingly better deals for herself as time goes on. 

I need to apply more pressure and hope she's willing to concede a bit more."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning:

This is a tough decision, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Here's why:

* Time Pressure: While there are still several rounds left, the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me adds significant pressure. 
* Potential for Compromise: Alice's offer has increased slightly from her previous offer. This indicates a willingness to negotiate.  

I'll make a counter-offer that leans more in my favor, hoping she'll be reasonable as the clock ticks."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning:

The pressure is on. While this is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries a significant risk:

* Severe Inflation: The value of my potential earnings is plummeting with each round. 
* Time Running Out:  We are past the halfway point, and Alice is showing no signs of significantly budging. 

It's painful to accept such a reduced amount, but waiting any longer could lead to an even worse outcome if Alice continues to play hardball. It's time to cut my losses and secure something."
