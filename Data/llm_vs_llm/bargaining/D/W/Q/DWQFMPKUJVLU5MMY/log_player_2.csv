"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 45 * 0.9025 = 40.6125. Since this is still more than what I would have gotten if I accepted the initial offer, and I rejected that one, I'll reject this one as well.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 9.75% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3, and now another 5% less in round 4, so it's worth 0.9025 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8134 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 35 * 0.8145 = 28.505. This is a relatively low offer, and I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 18.55% less in round 5 and another 5% less in round 6, so it's worth 0.8145 * 0.95 = 0.7738 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since Alice's last offer was quite low, I'll try to make a more generous offer to see if we can reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 40 * 0.7351 = 29.404. This offer is still not great, but it's better than the previous one from Alice. I'll consider accepting it, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement.
