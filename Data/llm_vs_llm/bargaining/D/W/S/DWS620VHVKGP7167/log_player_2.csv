"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The total amount will be worth 5% less to me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
4. Getting $500,000 now is better than risking a lower value due to inflation

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk and the fairness of the offer, I'll accept.
