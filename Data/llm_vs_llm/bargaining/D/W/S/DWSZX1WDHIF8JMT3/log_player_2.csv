"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth: $100 * 0.95 = $95
   * Alice's money won't lose value

$45 is a decent offer, and while not perfectly equal, it's close enough. If I reject, I lose 5% value, and Alice might make an even worse offer in retaliation in future rounds. The risk of getting less outweighs the potential benefit of asking for more.
