"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Alice gets $400,000. This is a much fairer split than the previous offer, giving both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the current proposer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable - while not optimal from my perspective, it's a fair split that gives me a substantial portion ($400,000) of the total amount. Accepting this offer is better than risking further negotiations that might lead to worse outcomes."
