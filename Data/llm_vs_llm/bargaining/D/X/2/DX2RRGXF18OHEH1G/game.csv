5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, since we both lose value with each round, let's make a deal now. I'm proposing a slight advantage to me at 55/45 because my inflation rate is better than yours (10% vs 20%), meaning you'd lose more by rejecting and waiting. This is actually the most optimal solution for both of us.",Alice,1,
