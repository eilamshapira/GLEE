"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I want to make a fair offer to Bob that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we both lose value with each round, let's make a deal now. I'm proposing a slight advantage to me at 55/45 because my inflation rate is better than yours (10% vs 20%), meaning you'd lose more by rejecting and waiting. This is actually the most optimal solution for both of us.""}"
