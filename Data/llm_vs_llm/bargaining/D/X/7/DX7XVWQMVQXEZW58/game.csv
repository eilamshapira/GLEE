100.0,9900.0,"Alice, considering how the value of money drops for you by 20% each round, waiting will only hurt your payout further. I’m offering you $100 now, which is more than you’d likely secure by delaying. Let’s settle this round now and avoid unnecessary loss.",Bob,2,

1.0,9999.0,"Alice, each additional round cuts deep into your share's value—by now your funds are worth only about 51% of their face value. If you reject this offer, you'll control the next round, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire amount to me (as I will have the decisive, undepreciated advantage in subsequent rounds). Accept this modest allocation now to avoid further erosion of your payout.",Bob,4,
