Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering how the value of money drops for you by 20% each round, waiting will only hurt your payout further. I’m offering you $100 now, which is more than you’d likely secure by delaying. Let’s settle this round now and avoid unnecessary loss. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, each additional round cuts deep into your share's value—by now your funds are worth only about 51% of their face value. If you reject this offer, you'll control the next round, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire amount to me (as I will have the decisive, undepreciated advantage in subsequent rounds). Accept this modest allocation now to avoid further erosion of your payout. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999
