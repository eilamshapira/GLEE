Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9900, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Alice, considering how the value of money drops for you by 20% each round, waiting will only hurt your payout further. I’m offering you $100 now, which is more than you’d likely secure by delaying. Let’s settle this round now and avoid unnecessary loss.""}"

# Alice's message: I know I lost a lot of value last round, but I'm still willing to compromise. This offer is fair, and I'm confident we can reach a resolution. 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, each additional round cuts deep into your share's value—by now your funds are worth only about 51% of their face value. If you reject this offer, you'll control the next round, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire amount to me (as I will have the decisive, undepreciated advantage in subsequent rounds). Accept this modest allocation now to avoid further erosion of your payout.""}"
