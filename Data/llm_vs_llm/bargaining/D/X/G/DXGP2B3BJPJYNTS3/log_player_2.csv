"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100 total, keeping $60 for herself. She's right that there's an inflation risk - if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. Let me evaluate this offer.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me due to inflation. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself in the next round, I need to consider this reduction in value.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair initially, considering the inflation penalty I face, a 60-40 split in the first round is actually reasonable.
