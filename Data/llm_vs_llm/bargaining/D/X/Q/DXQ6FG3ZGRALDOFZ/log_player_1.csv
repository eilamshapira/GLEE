"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game. Let me think about a fair offer that considers the inflation situation.

Since there's no inflation effect for me (Alice) but Bob faces 5% inflation per round, it's in Bob's interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. A fair starting point might be slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'd like to offer Bob $4,500 while I take $5,500. This is relatively fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully given the inflation dynamic.

Bob has offered an even split of $5,000 each. From my perspective as Alice, this is a fair offer - I would receive exactly $5,000.

For Bob, due to 5% inflation since round 1, his $5,000 is actually worth only $4,750 in round 1 terms. If I reject and we continue to round 3, his money will be worth even less due to additional 5% inflation.

Since this offer is fair and gives me a 50/50 split (which is better than my initial offer where I would have received $5,500), it makes sense to accept.
