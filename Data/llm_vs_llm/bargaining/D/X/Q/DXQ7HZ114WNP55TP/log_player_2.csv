"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's a reasonable offer, but since the value of the money decreases for me each round, I'd like to propose a division that reflects this disadvantage. I'll suggest a 55-45 split in my favor to account for the inflation I'll face in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Sorry Alice, but I need to account for the inflation I'll face in future rounds. Let's settle for a 55-45 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your inflation concerns, I propose a 47.5-52.5 split. It's a compromise that acknowledges your situation while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer takes into account the inflation I'm facing and provides me with a higher portion of the money. It's a fair compromise, so I'll accept this offer and end the game."
