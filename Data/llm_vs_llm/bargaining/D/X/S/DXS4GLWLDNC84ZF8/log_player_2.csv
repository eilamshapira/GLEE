"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$
- This is a 45%-55% split in Alice's favor
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, the money's value stays the same for me across rounds
- This is a fairly reasonable offer, close to 50-50
- Negotiating further might risk losing a good deal

I'll accept this offer since it's reasonably fair and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later.
