550000.0,450000.0,"Okay Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about I take $550000 and you get $450000? Remember, the value of money is decreasing for me, so this is a significant concession. Let's make a deal!",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"I understand inflation is affecting your gains significantly. Given this situation, I propose I take $550000 and you get $450000. Since your money is worth 36% less, you might want to agree now before further inflation impacts. This is still a reasonable split considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
