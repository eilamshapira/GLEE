Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is affecting your gains significantly. Given this situation, I propose I take $550000 and you get $450000. Since your money is worth 36% less, you might want to agree now before further inflation impacts. This is still a reasonable split considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 550000
