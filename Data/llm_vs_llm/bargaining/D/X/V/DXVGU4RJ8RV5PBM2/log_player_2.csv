"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60/40. We both win, and avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's opening offer gives me 400,000$ (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation impact on my side, which gives me some negotiating power
4. We have 11 more rounds available
5. A 50/50 split would be more equitable, giving me 500,000$

Since I know I won't lose value to inflation and there are plenty of rounds left, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. A 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems too generous when a more equal distribution is possible.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a constructive tone:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share of $500,000. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both equally.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about I take $550000 and you get $450000? Remember, the value of money is decreasing for me, so this is a significant concession. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has revealed that inflation is affecting her value (36% less for her)
2. Her current offer gives me $450,000 (with no depreciation)
3. For Alice, her $550,000 is actually worth only $352,000 (after 36% inflation)
4. She's moved from 60/40 to 55/45, showing willingness to negotiate
5. However, given that inflation is heavily impacting her and not me, I have a stronger negotiating position
6. We still have 9 rounds left

Since inflation is significantly impacting Alice but not me, and we have many rounds left, I can still negotiate for a better deal. The fact that her money is worth 36% less means she might be more willing to agree to a better split in my favor in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing significant inflation (36%) and has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll propose a split that takes this into account but leans more in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand inflation is affecting your gains significantly. Given this situation, I propose I take $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since your money is worth 36% less, you might want to agree now before further inflation impacts. This is still a reasonable split considering the circumstances.""}"
