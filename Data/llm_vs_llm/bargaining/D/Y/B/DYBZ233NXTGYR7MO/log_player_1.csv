"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm feeling the inflation pressure, so I need a larger share to compensate. This offer still gives you a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
