"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $200,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 20% of the total. If I reject, we go to round 2, and I get to make a proposal, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me. 

If I reject and we go to round 2, I would be making a proposal on $800,000 in effective value (to me). This gives me an opportunity to propose a better split, but I also need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the 20% inflation that has already affected me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Since we're now in round 2, the effective value to me is $400,000 (after 20% inflation), but this is still better than the $200,000 Alice initially offered me."
