"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to Bob. Since we both want to maximize our gains and need to consider the 20% inflation penalty for declining, I'll propose a slightly favorable but not extreme split.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair
2. It gives me a modest advantage as the first mover
3. Bob should consider that rejecting this offer means the total amount will decrease by 20% in the next round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer gives me $4200 and him $5800
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where the money will be worth another 20% less
3. If I reject and make a new offer, the $10,000 will become worth $8,000 due to inflation
4. My current offer of $4200 is better than making a new proposal from $8,000 in the next round
5. The difference between my initial proposal and this one isn't large enough to justify losing 20% value
