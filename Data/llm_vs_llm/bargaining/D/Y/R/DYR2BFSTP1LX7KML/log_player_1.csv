"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Given the 10% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of $470,000 for me and $530,000 for Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, and accepting now avoids further devaluation of the total amount due to inflation."
