"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), I should aim for a fair but slightly advantageous first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable starting point that gives both parties a substantial amount while accounting for my higher inflation risk. I want to avoid too many rounds due to my steeper inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation in round 2:
   * My $4000 is worth 20% less = $3200 effective value
   * Bob's $6000 is worth 5% less = $5700 effective value

This is not a favorable split for me. Given that my inflation rate is higher (20% vs 5%), waiting another round will hurt me more than Bob. However, $3200 effective value is too low compared to my initial offer.

I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, hoping to reach a better compromise.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic counter-offer. Since we're in round 3:
- My inflation has accumulated to 40% (two rounds of 20%)
- Bob's inflation has accumulated to 10% (two rounds of 5%)
- We need to reach an agreement soon as my value drops faster

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm making a more moderate offer than my first one, moving closer to the middle ground while still accounting for my higher inflation risk. This split should be more appealing to Bob while still being worthwhile for me despite the accumulated inflation."
