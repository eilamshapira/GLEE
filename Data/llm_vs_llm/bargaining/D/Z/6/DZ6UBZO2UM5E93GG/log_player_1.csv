"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $60, and you get $40. Accepting now means we both secure immediate, undiminished value—delays only cut into what I'm worth. Let's settle this quickly and fairly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's compromise. I propose that I take $55 and you take $45. This way, we both gain a bit more and can avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the further decay in value for me in subsequent rounds, the current proposal gives me a fair effective value. I’ll accept your offer as it secures us both a definite and relatively good outcome.""}"
