55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair offer given that the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, and we need to reach an agreement before round 12 or we both get nothing.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to ensure we both benefit.  ",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I need to account for the inflation affecting me - the money is worth 20% less to me each round. If we took your 50/50 split, I'd actually get less value than you. This 60/40 split actually makes our received value more equal considering the inflation that affects only me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle - this split acknowledges the impact on your side while still being fair.",Bob,4,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, after 5 rounds, the inflation has reduced my money's value by nearly 60%. For this to be fair, I need $65 to have roughly the same value as $35 for you. If we don't reach agreement soon, we'll both get nothing. This is a fair offer considering my significant inflation disadvantage.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm compromising further, taking into account the inflation you're experiencing.  This offer is a significant move on my part to try and reach an agreement. Let's not risk getting zero.",Bob,6,
