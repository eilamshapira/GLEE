"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair offer given that the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, and we need to reach an agreement before round 12 or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to ensure we both benefit.  ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to account for the inflation affecting me - the money is worth 20% less to me each round. If we took your 50/50 split, I'd actually get less value than you. This 60/40 split actually makes our received value more equal considering the inflation that affects only me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to leverage the information about inflation to her advantage. While it's true she's affected, she's using it to justify an unfair split. It's still likely we can reach a more agreeable outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle - this split acknowledges the impact on your side while still being fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after 5 rounds, the inflation has reduced my money's value by nearly 60%. For this to be fair, I need $65 to have roughly the same value as $35 for you. If we don't reach agreement soon, we'll both get nothing. This is a fair offer considering my significant inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While I understand the increasing pressure from the inflation Alice faces, her offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. Accepting a 35/65 split would be significantly disadvantageous to me.  It's still more beneficial for me to push for a fairer split, even with the risk of reaching no agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm compromising further, taking into account the inflation you're experiencing.  This offer is a significant move on my part to try and reach an agreement. Let's not risk getting zero.""}"
