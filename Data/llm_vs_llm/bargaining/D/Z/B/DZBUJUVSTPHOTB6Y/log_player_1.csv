"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this offer. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I have some leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60-40 split which, while favoring me, still gives Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, their share in the next round will be worth 5% less to them, which should factor into their decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - My money keeps its value
3. However, prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob making even less favorable offers later

While I might be able to get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer, the 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. There's no guarantee that I could secure a significantly better outcome in the next round, and this offer gives me a decent amount.
