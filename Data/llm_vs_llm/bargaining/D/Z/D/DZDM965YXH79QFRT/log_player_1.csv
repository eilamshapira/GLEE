Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split this 50-50. With inflation affecting future rounds, we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon. This is an equitable solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
