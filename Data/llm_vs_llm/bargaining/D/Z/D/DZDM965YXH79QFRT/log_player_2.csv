"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get something.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me just 10% of the total amount ($1,000), which is quite low. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, but I could potentially get a much better share.

Even with the 20% inflation penalty in the next round, if I could secure a 50-50 split (5000$), I would get $4,000 after inflation, which is much better than the current $1,000 offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this 50-50. With inflation affecting future rounds, we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon. This is an equitable solution for both of us.""}"
