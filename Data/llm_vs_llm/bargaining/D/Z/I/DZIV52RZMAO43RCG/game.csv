50.0,50.0,"Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, I appreciate your fairness, but time is money—literally. Given the future discounting you face, I believe this immediate split is in both our interests. Accepting now avoids further loss on your end. Let’s settle quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, since you're keen on settling quickly and considering the inflation affecting me, I'm willing to take a bit less than half. How about 40 for me and 60 for you? This way, we both get something reasonable before the value drops further for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but if we delay further, you'll be in an even weaker position. As things stand, if you reject, you'll get to propose in the next round—but you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly all of the money to keep him willing to accept, which means you'll end up with almost nothing. This offer gives you a minimal, yet tangible amount immediately. Please accept, so we both avoid further unnecessary losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Bob, it's clear we need to find a middle ground. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my side, I'm proposing 30 for me and 70 for you. This way, you get a significant share, and I still walk away with something before the value diminishes further. Let's end this soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, I understand your hesitation, but please consider the harsh reality: if you decline this offer, you'll be forced into the next round where your share is further eroded by inflation—practically leaving you with nothing. Accepting this split ensures you receive a small, yet guaranteed, amount immediately while I retain nearly all of the value. It's in both our best interests to settle now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
20.0,80.0,"Bob, we're getting deeper into this, and inflation is hitting me hard. I'm willing to go down to 20 for me and 80 for you. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's better than continuing this cycle where I end up with nothing. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, I know this process has been far from ideal and that inflation keeps eating into your share. If we push this any further, your portion will only shrink more. I'm offering you $15 now—better than the diminishing value you'd face in future rounds. Let's settle now and avoid further losses for both of us.",Bob,8,
