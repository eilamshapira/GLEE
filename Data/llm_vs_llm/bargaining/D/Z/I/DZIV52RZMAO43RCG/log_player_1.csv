Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fairness, but time is money—literally. Given the future discounting you face, I believe this immediate split is in both our interests. Accepting now avoids further loss on your end. Let’s settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Bob, since you're keen on settling quickly and considering the inflation affecting me, I'm willing to take a bit less than half. How about 40 for me and 60 for you? This way, we both get something reasonable before the value drops further for me.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but if we delay further, you'll be in an even weaker position. As things stand, if you reject, you'll get to propose in the next round—but you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly all of the money to keep him willing to accept, which means you'll end up with almost nothing. This offer gives you a minimal, yet tangible amount immediately. Please accept, so we both avoid further unnecessary losses.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your hesitation, but please consider the harsh reality: if you decline this offer, you'll be forced into the next round where your share is further eroded by inflation—practically leaving you with nothing. Accepting this split ensures you receive a small, yet guaranteed, amount immediately while I retain nearly all of the value. It's in both our best interests to settle now.

Round 8

Bob's offer:

I'm offering you $15 now—better than the diminishing value you'd face in future rounds. Let's settle now and avoid further losses for both of us.
