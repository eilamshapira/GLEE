"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you 20% of the money. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer of 20% ($2,000) seems quite low, considering we're dividing $10,000. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I can safely reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round that would be more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while being firm but reasonable.

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and I believe it's the most reasonable solution for both of us.""
}"
