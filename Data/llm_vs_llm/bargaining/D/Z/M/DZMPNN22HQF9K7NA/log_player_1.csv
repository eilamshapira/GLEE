"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will reduce the value due to inflation (more severely for me than Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. This is a reasonable offer considering that if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less for both of us, and especially for me with my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $45, but with 10% inflation = $40.50 real value
   * Bob gets $55, but with 5% inflation = $52.25 real value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Values will decrease further (20% for me, 10% for Bob)
   * Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again

Given that:
* The offer isn't terribly unfair
* The inflation penalty is higher for me than Bob
* Further rounds will erode value significantly
* There's no guarantee of a better outcome in future rounds
