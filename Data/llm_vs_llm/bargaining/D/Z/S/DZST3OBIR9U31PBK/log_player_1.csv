"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair offer that takes into account the inflation pressure I'm facing while still being attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I know I face 20% inflation per round, so this gives me some cushion while still offering Bob a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of my inflation pressure, but I need to find a better middle ground that acknowledges both our positions.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still protecting myself from the inflation effects. Since my money loses 20% value each round, I need to secure enough now, but I'm willing to improve Bob's share to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
