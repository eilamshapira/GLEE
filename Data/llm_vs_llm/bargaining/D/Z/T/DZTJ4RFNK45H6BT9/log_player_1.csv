# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact, I need to secure more to make this worthwhile. A 60/40 split in my favor seems reasonable now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This offer is worse than Bob's original offer in round 1. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I believe it's worth holding out for a better deal, especially since the value of my potential gain remains consistent."
