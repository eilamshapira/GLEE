Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, and we need to compromise. 50/50 is the fairest split right now. We can't keep going back and forth, it's only hurting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
