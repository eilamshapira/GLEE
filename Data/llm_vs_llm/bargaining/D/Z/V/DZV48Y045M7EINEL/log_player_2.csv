"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me 40$ out of 100$. If I reject this offer and move to the next round:
- The total value will decrease by 10% for me (90$ total value)
- It will decrease by 5% for Alice (95$ total value)
- I can make my own proposal

While 40$ is less than half, if I reject and we continue negotiating, the total value will decrease significantly. From 90$ in the next round, I could propose a split, but Alice might also reject, leading to further devaluation.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (10% vs 5%) that hurt me more than Alice, it's better to accept a slightly lower amount now than risk further devaluation.
