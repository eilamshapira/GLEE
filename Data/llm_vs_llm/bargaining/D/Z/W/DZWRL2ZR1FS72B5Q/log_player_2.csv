"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Alice's offer is too low, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Even with the 20% inflation penalty per round, I can propose a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. While I know I'm facing a 20% penalty this round, this is still much better than accepting Alice's previous offer of only 100,000. My 500,000 after the 20% penalty would be worth 400,000, which is four times better than her initial offer. This split is fair and should be attractive to Alice since she's not affected by inflation."
