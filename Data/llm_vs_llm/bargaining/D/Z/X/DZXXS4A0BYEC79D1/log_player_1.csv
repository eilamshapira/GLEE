"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it equal for both of us, 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual value of the offer is:

$5000 * 0.9 = $4500 for me
$5000 * 0.9 = $4500 for Bob

Considering this, I think 50/50 is a fair split, especially since the value will decrease further in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
