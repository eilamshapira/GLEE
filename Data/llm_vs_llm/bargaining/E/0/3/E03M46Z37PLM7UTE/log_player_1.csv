Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the amount equally so we both benefit fairly. Inflation affects the total value, so this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
