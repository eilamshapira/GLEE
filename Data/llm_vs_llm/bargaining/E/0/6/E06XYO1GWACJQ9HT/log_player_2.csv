"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me.
Current offer: $40 for me
If I reject: Next round any amount I get will only be worth 80% of its nominal value.
To get the same value as $40 now, I would need $50 in the next round.

While a 40-60 split isn't completely fair, rejecting might lead to a worse outcome due to inflation. Even if I propose a better split next round, the 20% reduction in value could offset any gains.
