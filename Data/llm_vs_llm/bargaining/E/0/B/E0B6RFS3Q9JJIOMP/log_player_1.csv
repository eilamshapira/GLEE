"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you took a larger share in the first round, I'm proposing a similar split but with the advantage shifted to me this time. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a fair counter-proposal that mirrors my initial offer, and it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk getting nothing if we continue disagreeing."
