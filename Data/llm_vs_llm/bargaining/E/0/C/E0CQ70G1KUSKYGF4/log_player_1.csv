"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.28, ""bob_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $51.28 and you'll receive $48.72. Accepting now ensures we both get more value since each round reduces the total by 5%. Looking forward to a fair and efficient outcome!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get the same amount, and we don't have to worry about further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, your proposal is generous and, given the inflation penalty, better than what I could expect by holding out. An even split now yields me effectively more than what a counteroffer would bring as the rounds progress due to further devaluation. I'm happy to accept your offer.""}"
