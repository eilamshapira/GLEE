"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept while accounting for the 10% inflation risk if he declines.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to an even division while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be worth 10% less to me, making it in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation, if I receive $4500, it's actually worth $4050 to me (4500 * 0.9).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to compounding inflation. This means I'd need to secure a significantly higher nominal amount to make up for the loss in value, and Bob might not accept such a proposal.

My original offer from round 1 would now be worth less to me than Bob's current offer, so this is actually the best outcome I can reasonably expect.
