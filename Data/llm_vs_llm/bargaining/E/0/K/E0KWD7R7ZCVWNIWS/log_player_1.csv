"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will consider the inflation. The current value of the money is 95$.
If I accept, I will get 40$. If I reject, the value of money will decrease further.
