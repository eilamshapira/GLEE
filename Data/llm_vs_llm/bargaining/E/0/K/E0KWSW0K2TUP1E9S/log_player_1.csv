"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, this is actually quite equitable. If we delay, my share would be worth less, while you might not face the same inflation effect. Let's settle now and both walk away with significant value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's go for an even split: $500000 each. This way, we both benefit equally without worrying about how inflation affects us differently. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
