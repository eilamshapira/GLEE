"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, this is actually quite equitable. If we delay, my share would be worth less, while you might not face the same inflation effect. Let's settle now and both walk away with significant value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
