"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion. This increases the likelihood of him accepting and avoiding the loss of value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and now has proposed a 45/55 split in his favor. Considering inflation hasn't affected my potential gain yet, and the next round's inflation would affect me, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
