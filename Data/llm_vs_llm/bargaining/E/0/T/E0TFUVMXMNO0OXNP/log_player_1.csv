"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the inflation penalties. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's more favorable than a 50-50 split, but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the 20% penalty by rejecting. It acknowledges my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation differences while not being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but with 5% inflation penalty, so effectively $42.75
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But everything will be worth 10% less for me and 40% less for Bob
   - This gives me stronger negotiating power
   - Bob's position will be significantly weaker due to the steep 40% penalty

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's severe inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3:
- For me, money is worth 10% less than original value
- For Bob, money is worth 40% less than original value

Bob is in a much weaker position now due to the severe 40% depreciation. Any money he gets now is worth significantly less to him, so he should be more willing to accept a lower amount rather than risk another round of heavy depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing this more aggressive split because:
1. Bob's severe inflation penalty makes waiting costly for him
2. Even a smaller amount now is better for Bob than risking another 20% depreciation
3. My inflation penalty is still relatively modest at 10%"
