60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to further rounds, the money becomes worth less to me due to 10% inflation per round, while it stays the same value for you. Let's agree and both walk away with something good.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation hurts you more. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a better deal for you considering the diminishing value for you in future rounds. Accept this offer.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's be fair. I'm now offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation that affects only me while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue to reject offers, we'll both lose value. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, the inflation is seriously hurting your potential gains. I'm now offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is the best offer you'll likely get. Think about it: Another round of inflation and you'll be wishing you took this deal!",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle with a fair 50/50 split. We've gone through several rounds already, and inflation is reducing my earnings while you lose nothing. At this point, an even split is equitable considering the circumstances. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up worse off. Let's agree on this balanced offer and end the game on fair terms.",Alice,5,
