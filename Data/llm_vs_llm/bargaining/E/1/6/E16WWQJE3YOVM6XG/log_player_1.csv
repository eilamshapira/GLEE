"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that accounts for the decreasing value of money for me in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to further rounds, the money becomes worth less to me due to 10% inflation per round, while it stays the same value for you. Let's agree and both walk away with something good.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation hurts you more. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a better deal for you considering the diminishing value for you in future rounds. Accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's be fair. I'm now offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation that affects only me while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue to reject offers, we'll both lose value. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is seriously hurting your potential gains. I'm now offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is the best offer you'll likely get. Think about it: Another round of inflation and you'll be wishing you took this deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a fair 50/50 split. We've gone through several rounds already, and inflation is reducing my earnings while you lose nothing. At this point, an even split is equitable considering the circumstances. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up worse off. Let's agree on this balanced offer and end the game on fair terms.""}"
