"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's offering an even split of the $10,000, with $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair proposal that gives us equal amounts. Since there's no inflation effect for me (0% less with each round), I don't lose any value by continuing to later rounds. However, continuing the negotiation means risking the entire amount if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

Given that the offer is fair and there's no strategic advantage for me to reject it based on the information provided, I'll accept.
