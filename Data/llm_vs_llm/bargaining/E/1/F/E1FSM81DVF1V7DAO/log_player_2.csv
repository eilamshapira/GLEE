"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. This is a fair starting offer.

Given that:
1. The money doesn't lose value for me with each round (0% inflation)
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. We have a maximum of 12 rounds
4. If we can't agree in 12 rounds, we both get nothing

Since the offer is already fair and there's no inflation penalty for me, accepting now guarantees me $500,000. While I could potentially negotiate for more in future rounds, there's also risk in prolonging the game.
