"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on. Since I'm making the first move, I'll offer a slightly favorable split to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This is a fair offer where Bob gets a slight advantage to incentivize acceptance. If he declines and we go to the next round, my potential gain would already be reduced by 20% due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
