"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation will impact us both in later rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering myself slightly more than half (55%) initially. This is because:

*   **First-mover advantage:** Making the first offer gives me some leverage to propose a division slightly in my favor.
*   **Inflation:** I know that with each round the money loses value. I want to secure a reasonable amount upfront.
*   **Acceptability:** The offer needs to be reasonable enough that Bob will accept it. If I offer too little to Bob, he'll reject it and I'll lose even more value in the next round due to inflation.
*   **Bob's higher inflation rate:** Bob loses value faster than I do, which might make him more willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk further losses."
