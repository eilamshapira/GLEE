"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
* $4000 now is worth more than $5000 next round (which would be worth $4000 after 20% inflation)
* I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so I can't predict if she'll be more willing to accept a lower amount next round

Given that $4000 now is a reasonable amount and inflation would reduce the real value of any future gains, I'll accept this offer.
