"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the dwindling value due to inflation. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a generous offer, but still favoring myself slightly, considering I need to account for potential future losses due to inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is an even split. However, the money is now worth 5% less to me than in the first round. 5% of $5500 (my proposed gain in round 1) is $275. $5000 is less than my original proposal by $500. Considering the inflation and the fact this is only round 2, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time for my counter-offer. I need to factor in the cumulative inflation effect now. The money I receive will be worth 10% less than in round 1. I also need to consider that Bob rejected a 50/50 split. Let's try to find a balance between getting a reasonable amount and avoiding another rejection.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is now offering me less than half. My money is worth 14.26% less than in round 1. Let's calculate the value of $4800 in round 1 money:

$4800 / (1 - 0.1426) = $5598.26

So, in terms of round 1 value, Bob is offering me approximately $5598.26. This is quite a bit better than before. Considering this, I'll accept the offer.
