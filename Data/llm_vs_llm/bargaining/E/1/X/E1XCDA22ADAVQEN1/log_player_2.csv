"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 60-40 split? I think this is a fair offer! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will decrease by 10% (to $9,000)
4. In absolute terms, even 40% now ($4,000) is better than 50% next round ($4,500)

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, accepting this offer is mathematically better than waiting for the next round due to the inflation penalty.
