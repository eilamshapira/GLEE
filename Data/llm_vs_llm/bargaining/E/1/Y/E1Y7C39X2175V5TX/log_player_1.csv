"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a relatively fair split, accounting for the fact that if Bob rejects, the total value will decrease by 5% for me in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting. If he rejects, the next round's $10,000 will only be worth $9,500 to me, so I have an incentive to make a fair offer now."
