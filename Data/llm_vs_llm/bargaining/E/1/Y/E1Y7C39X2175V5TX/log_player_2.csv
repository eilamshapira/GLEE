"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With this offer, I would get $4,500. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $4,500 would effectively become worth $3,600.

Even if I could negotiate a better split in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $4,500 to make up for the 20% inflation loss. Moreover, Alice could still reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

$4,500 is a reasonable offer - it's close to a 50-50 split. Given the inflation risk, I should take this deal.
