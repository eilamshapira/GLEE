"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $40 while she keeps $60. Given that we have 12 rounds maximum, and each round reduces my money's value by 5% due to inflation, I should calculate the time cost of negotiation.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, any amount I receive would be worth 5% less. So $40 now is equivalent to about $42.11 in the next round ($40 รท 0.95). If I believe I can get significantly more than $42.11 in the next round, it might be worth rejecting.

However, there's risk in rejection - we could end up with nothing if we reach 12 rounds without agreement. Since this is the first round and $40 is a substantial portion of the total, I'll accept this offer to secure a guaranteed amount.
