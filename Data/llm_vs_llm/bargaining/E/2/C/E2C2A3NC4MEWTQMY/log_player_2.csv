"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a generous offer to start, let's secure a good outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of the total)
2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me
   * I'll get to make the next proposal
   * But Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer of 4000$ is less than half, but it's still a substantial amount. If I reject and we go another round, my 4000$ would be worth only 3800$ due to 5% inflation. To make up for this loss, I'd need to secure a significantly better deal in the next round, which Alice might reject.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that 4000$ is still a meaningful amount, I'll accept this offer.
