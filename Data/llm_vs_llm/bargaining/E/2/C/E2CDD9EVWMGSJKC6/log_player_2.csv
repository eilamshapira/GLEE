"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is not a fair division. Alice is offering me only 10% of the total sum, keeping 90% for herself. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, but this offer is too unbalanced.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing this split because it's fair and acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value at 5% per round and yours at 20% per round, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. This division gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my position as the current proposer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, but it's still quite unbalanced in her favor. She's offering me only 20% of the total amount, while keeping 80% for herself. Given the inflation rates, we're both losing value with each passing round, but she's losing value faster than I am.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that considers our different inflation rates and the fact that we've already lost value through multiple rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split. This is a fair division that recognizes that we both lose from continued negotiation, but you lose more due to your higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%). This balanced offer gives us both a substantial amount and prevents further value erosion for both of us."
