"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the risk of losing everything if we reach round 13.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

My reasoning is that this gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a substantial amount of money, making it more likely he will accept. It's better to secure almost half a million than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is aiming for a slightly larger share. To avoid further rounds and the risk of getting nothing, I will accept his offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
