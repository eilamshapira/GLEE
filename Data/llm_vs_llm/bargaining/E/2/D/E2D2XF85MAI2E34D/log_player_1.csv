"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer, but fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division with the following explanation: ""I offer you $45, which is close to a fair split. Accepting now means you get full value before inflation kicks in."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My $50 would be worth $47.50 due to 5% inflation
2. While Bob's split is equal, the time value loss makes this worse than my initial offer
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (10% for me)
4. But I could propose a better split for myself

However, given that Bob's inflation rate is higher (20%), and I know further delays hurt both of us, this is actually a reasonable compromise.
