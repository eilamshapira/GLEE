"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since we both face inflation but mine is higher (10% vs 5%), I'm offering you a bit more than half to start. This way we can hopefully reach an agreement quickly, which benefits both of us given the inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rates are affecting us differently, I'll adjust my offer to make it more appealing while accounting for the time pressure we both face.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm moving closer to an even split while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. Let's try to reach an agreement soon - with each round, both of us are losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see we're getting closer but still not reaching agreement. Given the increasing inflation impact, I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to both of us:

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900}

This is very close to an even split, but still accounts slightly for my higher inflation rate. Let's reach an agreement soon - we're already losing significant value with each passing round."
