"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While this offer gives me a significant portion of the money, I should consider that I can potentially get more, especially since I'll be making the next offer if I reject. However, I need to be mindful of the 5% inflation penalty per round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need to balance being fair while also accounting for this penalty. I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a slight advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'd like to propose this split as it's fair with a slight advantage to me, considering I'm facing inflation penalties in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully. Alice has increased my share slightly from her first offer ($4600 vs $4500). With inflation, this $4600 is actually worth about $4152 to me (applying the 9.75% inflation). If I reject and we go another round, inflation will increase to about 14.5% (5% more).

Let me consider: this is a reasonable offer that gives me 46% of the total, and the inflation penalty will only get worse if I keep rejecting. While I could try for more in the next round, the decreasing value due to inflation makes accepting now more attractive.
