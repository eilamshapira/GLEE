"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject and wait for next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice has no inflation penalty, so she can easily wait
4. $5000 now is better than any larger amount that's depreciated by 20% or more
5. A fair split in round 1 is a reasonable offer

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. If I reject, any future gains would be diminished by inflation, and Alice has no incentive to accept a worse deal later.
