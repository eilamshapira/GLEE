"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer in round 2, considering the inflation that only affects my share.

*   **My Share:** 4500$
*   **Inflation:** 20% decrease. My initial $10,000 are now worth $8,000. Since each round I lose 20%, this means the money is worth 0.8 of what it was in the previous round.

My actual value is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600

So, should I accept this?

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again in round 3. Considering the inflation, my share is worth less and less each round, I need to adjust my offer. I will try to get a bigger share for myself.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's round 4. I need to calculate my effective gain due to inflation. I know my share is worth 48.8% less than round 1. This means it is worth 51.2% of its original value.

*   **My Share:** 4200$
*   **Effective value**: $4200 * 0.512 = $2150.4

I should accept it if the value is higher than the expected value of my offer in the next round. Given that my share is decreasing, I should reject this.
