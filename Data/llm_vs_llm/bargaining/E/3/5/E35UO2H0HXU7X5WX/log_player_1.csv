I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this time.  I think it's fair, considering inflation has hit us both. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
