"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid the inflation penalty of further rounds. Let's make this deal and both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
