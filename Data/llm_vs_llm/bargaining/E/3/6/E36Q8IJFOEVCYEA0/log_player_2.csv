"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you 1000$ for an easy agreement. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 1000$ out of the 10,000$ total, which is only 10% of the pot. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, I need to weigh waiting for a better offer against the decreasing value.

If I reject and make my own offer next round, I could propose a more favorable split. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and the money will be worth 5% less.

In this case, I think it's best to seek a more equitable distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid the inflation penalty of further rounds. Let's make this deal and both benefit equally.""}"
