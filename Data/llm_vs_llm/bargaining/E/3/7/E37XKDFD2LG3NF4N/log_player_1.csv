"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you (5% per round) but not me (0%), accepting this equal split now is actually better for you than delaying. If we go another round, your $50 would be worth only $47.50 to you due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
