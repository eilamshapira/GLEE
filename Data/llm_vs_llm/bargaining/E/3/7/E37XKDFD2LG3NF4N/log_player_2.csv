"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly. I'm taking a bit more because of the inflation, but it's still a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is not entirely fair, as she proposes to take 60% of the money while offering me only 40%. While she mentions inflation, the situation actually favors me - inflation doesn't affect my value (0%), but it reduces her value by 5% each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, she'll face a 5% reduction in her money's value. This gives me leverage to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while explaining the inflation dynamics.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects you (5% per round) but not me (0%), accepting this equal split now is actually better for you than delaying. If we go another round, your $50 would be worth only $47.50 to you due to inflation.""}"
