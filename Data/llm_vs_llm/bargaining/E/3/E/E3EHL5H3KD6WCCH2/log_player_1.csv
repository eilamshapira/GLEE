"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need more than half to compensate for the inflation risk. This offer gives you a fair share while considering my risk. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my gain, I need to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4500 I would get is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me.

Given this, I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2). So, the value of my gain is now 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split favors you while still being reasonable for me""
}
```"
