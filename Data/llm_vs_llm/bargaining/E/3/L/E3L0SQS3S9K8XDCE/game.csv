55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $55 while you get $45. Considering the 10% devaluation on your share if we delay further, this offer is designed to provide you with the best immediate return. Let's settle quickly!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's be fair and split the money evenly. 50/50 is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the decreasing value.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the fair‐split sentiment. However, given that waiting only moderately affects me (5% per round) but hits you harder (10% per round), I expect that when it’s my turn to propose next round, I can craft an offer that ultimately yields me a better effective outcome. So, I’ll pass on your 50/50 for now.",Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, consider this: waiting another round will hit your share even harder—the 10% drop per round will leave you with far less real value. By accepting now, you secure $40, which in today's terms is worth 40 × 0.80 = $32 effective for you. If you reject and wait for round 4, even though you'll be the proposer then, the cumulative devaluation will force you to make an offer that leaves you with only a very small effective amount. I believe this offer is in both our best interests. Let’s wrap this up now!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, this is the same split you offered me in round one, but with the inflation we both lose now. Let's be reasonable and end this. This is my final offer.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand this is your final offer. Although waiting might let me propose a split later, the compounded devaluation would only reduce my effective share further. Accepting your offer gives me the highest guaranteed effective value at this stage. So I’m ready to conclude on these terms.",Alice,4,accept
