"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $55 while you get $45. Considering the 10% devaluation on your share if we delay further, this offer is designed to provide you with the best immediate return. Let's settle quickly! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: waiting another round will hit your share even harder—the 10% drop per round will leave you with far less real value. By accepting now, you secure $40, which in today's terms is worth 40 × 0.80 = $32 effective for you. If you reject and wait for round 4, even though you'll be the proposer then, the cumulative devaluation will force you to make an offer that leaves you with only a very small effective amount. I believe this offer is in both our best interests. Let’s wrap this up now! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
