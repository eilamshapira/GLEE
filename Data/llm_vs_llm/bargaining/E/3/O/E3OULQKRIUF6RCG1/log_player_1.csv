Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round one: I'll receive $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. Since every round reduces the total value by 10%, accepting now maximizes our returns. I believe this offer is fair and in both our best interests. Let's seal the deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is a fair reflection of the risk we both take by continuing.  Let's end this and maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
