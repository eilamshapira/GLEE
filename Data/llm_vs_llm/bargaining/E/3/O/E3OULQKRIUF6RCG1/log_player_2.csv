"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round one: I'll receive $600000 and you'll get $400000. Since every round reduces the total value by 10%, accepting now maximizes our returns. I believe this offer is fair and in both our best interests. Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
