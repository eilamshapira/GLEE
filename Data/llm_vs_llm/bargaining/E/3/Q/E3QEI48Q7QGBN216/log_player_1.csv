"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while being fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45, which is a reasonable split considering we both need to agree, and waiting will reduce the value for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $48 is worth 10% less, so effectively $43.2
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth even less due to continuing inflation
3. Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable, and the difference from my initial proposal isn't huge
4. Prolonging negotiations will definitely reduce my potential gains further

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer since the split is reasonable and inflation will keep eating into my potential gains if I continue negotiating."
