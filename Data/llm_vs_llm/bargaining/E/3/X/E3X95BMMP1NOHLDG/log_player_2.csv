"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $200,000 while taking $800,000 for herself. That's a 20-80 split, which is quite lopsided in her favor.

If I reject and move to round 2, I'll make the next offer. However, due to 10% inflation, the total value for me would be reduced to $900,000. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split in the next round, the total pot's value to me is decreasing.

Still, $200,000 is only 20% of the pot, which seems quite low for an even division. I believe I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. Since I've already experienced 10% inflation (reducing the effective value for me), this split helps compensate for that while still offering Alice a substantial portion that should be appealing compared to further negotiation rounds where we'd both lose value."
