60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a fair deal. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting the bigger share as I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose.  Let's see what you think!",Alice,1,

10.0,90.0,"Alice, it's my turn now. Considering the potential inflation uncertainties and the delays involved, I propose a quick resolution: I'll take $90 while you receive $10. I believe this offer reflects the need for efficiency and settles our deal without further complications.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for efficiency, but taking 90% of the money is a bit excessive.  Let's be reasonable and split the remaining money evenly.  This offer is fair, considering the inflation that has occurred.  Accept this, and we can move on.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness and inflation. However, if we continue, your share will likely depreciate further. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which guarantees you the same nominal amount as before, while avoiding additional declines due to inflation. Let's settle now and both secure our outcomes.",Bob,4,
