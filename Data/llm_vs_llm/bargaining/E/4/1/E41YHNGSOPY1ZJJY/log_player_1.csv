Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's my turn now. Considering the potential inflation uncertainties and the delays involved, I propose a quick resolution: I'll take $90 while you receive $10. I believe this offer reflects the need for efficiency and settles our deal without further complications.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness and inflation. However, if we continue, your share will likely depreciate further. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which guarantees you the same nominal amount as before, while avoiding additional declines due to inflation. Let's settle now and both secure our outcomes. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
