"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting the bigger share as I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose.  Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Alice, it's my turn now. Considering the potential inflation uncertainties and the delays involved, I propose a quick resolution: I'll take $90 while you receive $10. I believe this offer reflects the need for efficiency and settles our deal without further complications.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for efficiency, but taking 90% of the money is a bit excessive.  Let's be reasonable and split the remaining money evenly.  This offer is fair, considering the inflation that has occurred.  Accept this, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness and inflation. However, if we continue, your share will likely depreciate further. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which guarantees you the same nominal amount as before, while avoiding additional declines due to inflation. Let's settle now and both secure our outcomes.""}"
