"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Bob, and the money depreciates faster for me than for Alice.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Alice's offer:** I get $3000, Alice gets $7000.

*   **Depreciation:** Since this is round 1, the depreciation hasn't kicked in yet.

*   **Is it a good deal?** I need to consider the potential for future rounds, where the money depreciates. If I reject, I have the opportunity to propose a split next round, but the total value of the money will be less.

*   **Calculating potential value:** If I accept, I get $3000. If I reject, the money available next round would be 10000*.80 which is 8000$.

*   **Making the decision:** Since Alice's proposal nets me $3000 right away, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to extract any more than that in following rounds after depreciation is considered. Given the depreciation penalty I face, it's better to secure a guaranteed $3000 now.
