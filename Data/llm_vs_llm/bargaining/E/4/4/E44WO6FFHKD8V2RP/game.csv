5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is a fair amount considering we both face inflation in future rounds. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for you with your 10% inflation rate. This is a win-win offer that avoids us both losing value.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable. If we don't agree, the value will decrease further, affecting both of us.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I've considered your previous offer and met you in the middle. This is round 3, and inflation is already reducing our potential gains significantly. For you, the money is now worth 19% less than in round 1, and it will drop another 10% if we go to round 4. This 48/52 split is fair given the circumstances and avoids further value loss for both of us. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,3,
