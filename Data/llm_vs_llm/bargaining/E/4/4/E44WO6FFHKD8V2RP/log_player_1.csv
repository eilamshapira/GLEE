"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make an offer to Bob for dividing $10,000 between us. Since this is the first round, I should consider the inflation factor: with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob. This gives me some leverage because Bob has a stronger incentive to settle early.

Given this dynamic, a fair but strategic offer would be to give myself a bit more than half while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than continuing to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,500 which is a fair amount considering we both face inflation in future rounds. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for you with your 10% inflation rate. This is a win-win offer that avoids us both losing value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable. If we don't agree, the value will decrease further, affecting both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a new offer that accounts for the increasing inflation pressure on both of us, but particularly on Bob. At this point, due to inflation, any money I receive is worth about 10% less than in round 1, and Bob's money is worth about 19% less than in round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your previous offer and met you in the middle. This is round 3, and inflation is already reducing our potential gains significantly. For you, the money is now worth 19% less than in round 1, and it will drop another 10% if we go to round 4. This 48/52 split is fair given the circumstances and avoids further value loss for both of us. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes more value.""}"
