"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is a fair amount considering we both face inflation in future rounds. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for you with your 10% inflation rate. This is a win-win offer that avoids us both losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after the first round, the total value of the money is now:
For me: $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
For Alice: $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500

I'll make an offer based on the original $10,000.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable. If we don't agree, the value will decrease further, affecting both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your previous offer and met you in the middle. This is round 3, and inflation is already reducing our potential gains significantly. For you, the money is now worth 19% less than in round 1, and it will drop another 10% if we go to round 4. This 48/52 split is fair given the circumstances and avoids further value loss for both of us. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes more value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
