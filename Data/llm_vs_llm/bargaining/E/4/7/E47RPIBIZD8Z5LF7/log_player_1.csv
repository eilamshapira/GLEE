Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This takes into account that my share is worth 15% less than the original value due to the 20% inflation per round I face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
