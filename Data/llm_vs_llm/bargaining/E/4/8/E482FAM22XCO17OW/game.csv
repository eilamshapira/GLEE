450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to negotiate. I'm proposing a split where I get a bit more than half, which I think is fair. If you're facing inflation pressure, this deal now might be better than waiting for future rounds.",Bob,2,
