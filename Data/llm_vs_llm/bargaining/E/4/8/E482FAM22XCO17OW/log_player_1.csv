"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to negotiate. I'm proposing a split where I get a bit more than half, which I think is fair. If you're facing inflation pressure, this deal now might be better than waiting for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
