"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
- She would get $600,000
- There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting doesn't cost me anything
- I don't know if Alice faces inflation, which could give me negotiating leverage

This first offer gives me 40% of the total, which isn't terrible, but I think I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. Since there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but still reasonable for Alice, given that I don't know if she faces inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to negotiate. I'm proposing a split where I get a bit more than half, which I think is fair. If you're facing inflation pressure, this deal now might be better than waiting for future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're not feeling the inflation pressure yet, but it's a real factor in this negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle from our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

- She's now offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000
- She would get $550,000
- I've learned that Alice is facing inflation - her money is now worth 19% less than in round 1
- I still have no inflation penalty

Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me. She's clearly trying to reach a compromise between her initial offer and my counteroffer. The fact that she's facing inflation gives me some leverage, as each round makes her share less valuable.

However, this is a reasonable offer - I'd get 45% of the total. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate as Alice faces more inflation, I risk her making a less favorable offer in future rounds out of frustration.
