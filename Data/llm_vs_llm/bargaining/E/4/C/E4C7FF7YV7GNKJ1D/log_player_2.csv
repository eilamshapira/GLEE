Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While not ideal, it's better to hold out and see if I can improve my position in the next round. Alice is clearly aiming for a very advantageous split, and I need to make it clear that I'm not going to accept a raw deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 

Reasoning:

The value of the money is decreasing for me each round, and it's time to push for a more equitable split. A 50/50 split is fair and might be more appealing to Alice now than it would have been in earlier rounds.  It signals that I'm willing to accept a reasonable compromise but won't be taken advantage of."
