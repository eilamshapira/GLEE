"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite unbalanced in her favor. Given that she's proposing to keep $900,000 while offering me only $100,000, I think I should reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. While there is a devaluation with each round, the current split is too far from equitable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since both Alice and I face devaluation (mine at 10% per round and hers at 20% per round), I'll propose a more balanced split that takes into account our different devaluation rates while still being attractive to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both significant value. Since Alice faces higher devaluation (20% per round compared to my 10%), accepting this equal split now would be in her best interest rather than continuing to future rounds where her share would lose more value than mine."
