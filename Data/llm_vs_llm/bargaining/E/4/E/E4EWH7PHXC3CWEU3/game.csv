600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from extending negotiations.",Alice,1,

10000.0,990000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose we settle now: I take $990000 and you get $10000. I know this looks lopsided, but given that any further delay will further erode your share (with the inflation penalty you might be facing), accepting this offer maximizes your real value compared to waiting for your turn to propose. I hope you see the advantage of a prompt resolution.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you a better deal at 55-45 split. This is very reasonable and fair. If you reject, we both lose value - I from inflation and you from delaying a good deal. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but prolonging our negotiations will only worsen the effective value of your share due to inflation. While your last proposal would have given me $450000 and you $550000 (yielding an effective value of roughly $496375 for you), waiting further exposes you to even steeper losses. My current offer—$460000 for me and $540000 for you—secures an immediate settlement. Although nominally your share is lower, accepting now prevents any further devaluation. Let's conclude this quickly and protect our interests.",Bob,4,
