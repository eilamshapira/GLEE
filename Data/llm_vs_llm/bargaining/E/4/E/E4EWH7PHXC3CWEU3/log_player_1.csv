"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we settle now: I take $990000 and you get $10000. I know this looks lopsided, but given that any further delay will further erode your share (with the inflation penalty you might be facing), accepting this offer maximizes your real value compared to waiting for your turn to propose. I hope you see the advantage of a prompt resolution. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 5% inflation penalty is much less severe than accepting such an unfair split. Even with the penalty, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would give me more than $10,000."

""message"": ""Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you a better deal at 55-45 split. This is very reasonable and fair. If you reject, we both lose value - I from inflation and you from delaying a good deal. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but prolonging our negotiations will only worsen the effective value of your share due to inflation. While your last proposal would have given me $450000 and you $550000 (yielding an effective value of roughly $496375 for you), waiting further exposes you to even steeper losses. My current offer—$460000 for me and $540000 for you—secures an immediate settlement. Although nominally your share is lower, accepting now prevents any further devaluation. Let's conclude this quickly and protect our interests. 
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob has made a reasonable offer this time. With the 14.26% inflation penalty, my $540,000 would be worth about $463,000 in real terms, which is much better than risking further inflation penalties. Additionally, Bob has shown willingness to move significantly from his previous extreme offer, and this split is reasonably close to a fair division. Given the inflation pressure I'm under, this is a good time to conclude the negotiation."
