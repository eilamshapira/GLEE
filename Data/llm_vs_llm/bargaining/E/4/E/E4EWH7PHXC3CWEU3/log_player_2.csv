"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from extending negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we settle now: I take $990,000 and you get $10,000. I know this looks lopsided, but given that any further delay will further erode your share (with the inflation penalty you might be facing), accepting this offer maximizes your real value compared to waiting for your turn to propose. I hope you see the advantage of a prompt resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you a better deal at 55-45 split. This is very reasonable and fair. If you reject, we both lose value - I from inflation and you from delaying a good deal. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but prolonging our negotiations will only worsen the effective value of your share due to inflation. While your last proposal would have given me $450,000 and you $550,000 (yielding an effective value of roughly $496,375 for you), waiting further exposes you to even steeper losses. My current offer—$460,000 for me and $540,000 for you—secures an immediate settlement. Although nominally your share is lower, accepting now prevents any further devaluation. Let's conclude this quickly and protect our interests.""}"
