"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is just 10% of the total. Given that we're facing different inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for Alice), I should make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally - $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both significant value, and it accounts for the fact that we both face inflation with each passing round."
