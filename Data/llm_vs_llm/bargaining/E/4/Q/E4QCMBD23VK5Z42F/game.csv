,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think we can do better than 60/40, Alice. A 55/45 split seems more reasonable to me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 55/45 seems like a fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting you and not me, I think it's wise for you to accept a slightly lower share. A 57.5/42.5 split seems more reasonable now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're pushing me. This is a compromise - higher than your last offer but lower than my previous one. We need to agree soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think it's time for you to reconsider your expectations. A 60/40 split in my favor seems more reasonable now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, and you need to meet me closer to the middle. This is my final offer.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
375000.0,625000.0,"I understand you're taking a hit from inflation, but you've also been unwilling to accept my previous offers. Given the current situation, I think a 62.5/37.5 split is more than fair.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, this is the best I can do. Take it or leave it. We both get nothing if we don't agree now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your share, I think this is a generous offer. A 65/35 split is the best I'm willing to do. It's now or never.",Bob,10,
