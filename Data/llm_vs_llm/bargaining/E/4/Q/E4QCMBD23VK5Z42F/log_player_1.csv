Time is running out, but accepting a deal where I lose so much to inflation is not acceptable. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to push back firmly, but also signal some flexibility."

This is a terrible outcome, but with the rapidly increasing inflation and only two rounds left, it's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing. Bob has played this strategically, unfortunately."
