500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but I need to account for our different inflation rates. At this point, your money devalues at 20% per round while mine at only 10%, which means each round hurts you more than me. This offer is actually favorable to you compared to what you'd get after more rounds of negotiation. Let's avoid further devaluation for both of us.",Alice,3,
