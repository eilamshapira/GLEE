"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering both our incentives and the asymmetric inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep delaying, we both lose due to inflation - yours at 20% per round and mine at 10%. This offer maximizes our combined value. Let's avoid the inflation penalty.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, 
""bob_gain"": 425000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but I need to account for our different inflation rates. At this point, your money devalues at 20% per round while mine at only 10%, which means each round hurts you more than me. This offer is actually favorable to you compared to what you'd get after more rounds of negotiation. Let's avoid further devaluation for both of us.""}"
