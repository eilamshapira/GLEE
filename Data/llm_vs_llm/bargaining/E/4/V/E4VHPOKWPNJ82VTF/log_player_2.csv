"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep delaying, we both lose due to inflation - yours at 20% per round and mine at 10%. This offer maximizes our combined value. Let's avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for an even split, but I need to account for our different inflation rates. At this point, your money devalues at 20% per round while mine at only 10%, which means each round hurts you more than me. This offer is actually favorable to you compared to what you'd get after more rounds of negotiation. Let's avoid further devaluation for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000
