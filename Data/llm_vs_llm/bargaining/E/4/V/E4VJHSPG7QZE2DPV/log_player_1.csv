"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% less in round 1 and another 5% less in round 2).
To calculate the actual values:
My gain would be worth $x * 0.8 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain would be worth $y * 0.9 (due to 10% inflation)
I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
