Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the $10,000 is now worth $9,500 (5% less).
For Alice, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 (10% less).

Considering this, I'll make a fair offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is 10,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $9,025, and for Alice, it's 10,000 * (1 - 0.19) = $8,100.

Given Alice's offer of an equal split, I would get $5,000, which is worth $4,762.5 to me (50% of $9,525), and Alice would get $5,000, which is worth $4,050 to her.

However, since the offer is an equal split and considering the decreasing value of money, I think it's a reasonable offer.
