"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair offer that maximizes my gain while being attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting $600,000 and you getting $400,000. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm facing inflation pressure with each passing round."
