"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (so the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me). I also need to consider that if we go through all 12 rounds without agreement, we both get nothing.

Since Alice is taking a larger share but still offering me a substantial amount, and considering the inflation penalty for waiting, I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
