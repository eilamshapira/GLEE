"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but you'll get a decent chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Currently offered: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   - My $4000 would be worth 20% less ($3200 equivalent)
   - Her $6000 would be worth 10% less ($5400 equivalent)
   - But I could make a counter-offer

The offer is a 40-60 split, which isn't terrible, but given that I have the power to make the next offer and Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine, I should try to negotiate for a better deal early while the money is worth more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine, I need to secure a good deal early. I'll propose a more balanced split while still giving Alice a decent share to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but let's make it more balanced. I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is fair considering we both face inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Currently offered: $5000 for me, $5000 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $5000 is actually worth $3200 (36% less)
   - Alice's $5000 is worth $4050 (19% less)
3. If I reject, next round:
   - Inflation will increase further
   - I'll get another chance to make an offer, but the value will decrease more

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation is hitting me harder than Alice, and we're already three rounds in. A 50-50 split is fair, and continuing to negotiate might result in both of us losing more value. It's better to accept now before inflation erodes more value.
