"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is worse than Alice's first offer, even after factoring in two rounds of inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is barely acceptable after factoring in inflation. If I reject it and we go another round, the effects of inflation will hurt more and Alice will likely offer even less."
