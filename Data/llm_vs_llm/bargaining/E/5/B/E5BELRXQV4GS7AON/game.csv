344827.0,655173.0,"Hi Bob – I’m proposing we agree now to avoid further losses. I’ll take $344827 and you get $655173. Accepting now means neither of us suffers additional devaluation (for you, 5% next round; for me, 10%). I believe this is fair considering the future discounting. What do you say?",Alice,1,
