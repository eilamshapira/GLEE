Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 344827, ""bob_gain"": 655173, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I’m proposing we agree now to avoid further losses. I’ll take $344,827 and you get $655,173. Accepting now means neither of us suffers additional devaluation (for you, 5% next round; for me, 10%). I believe this is fair considering the future discounting. What do you say?""}"
