"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I’m proposing we agree now to avoid further losses. I’ll take $344827 and you get $655173. Accepting now means neither of us suffers additional devaluation (for you, 5% next round; for me, 10%). I believe this is fair considering the future discounting. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 655173 
# Alice gain: 344827 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
