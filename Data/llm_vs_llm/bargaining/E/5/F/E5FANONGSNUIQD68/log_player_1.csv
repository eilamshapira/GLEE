Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor because it's the first round and I have to consider the 20% inflation impact on my future gains if we continue. I hope you find this offer reasonable.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation. This is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now. Inflation is hitting me hard! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
