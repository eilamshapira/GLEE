"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share while still offering Bob a substantial amount. I believe this is fair as I'm making the first move, but not so unfair that Bob would definitely reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not as favorable as my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split (45-55), and rejecting it could lead to further rounds where the total amount might effectively decrease due to the time value of money. A guaranteed $450,000 is a good outcome."
