"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the diminishing value of the money in each round. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
