"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get 60, you get 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. While 40/60 isn't exactly equal, it's not terribly unfair
4. I could make a counter-offer, but then I'd only get 95% value of whatever we agree on

I think I'll reject this offer. While it's not terrible, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the 5% inflation hit.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid losing value to inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point. How about I get 55 and you get 45? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, this $45 is actually worth about $40.61
3. If I reject, next round's money will be worth even less to me (about 15% less than original)
4. Alice seems willing to negotiate and has moved significantly from her initial position
5. Given the inflation penalty affecting only me, this is actually a reasonable offer

I'll accept this offer. Further negotiation would likely reduce my real gains due to inflation.
