"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $10,000 in this first round, keeping in mind that inflation affects me more severely than it does Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $5,500 and Bob receiving $4,500. This is a fair initial offer that acknowledges the time pressure we both face, while giving us both a substantial portion. Since inflation will impact me more severely in later rounds (20% vs 10%), I believe this slight advantage in my favor is reasonable."
