"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient - I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can both get a fair share without further reducing the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* I would get $45, which is worth the full $45 for me since I'm not affected by inflation
* Bob would get $55, but it's worth 5% less to him due to inflation
* If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation
* $45 is less than my initial proposal of $60, but it's still a substantial amount

Given that we could lose more value to inflation in future rounds, and $45 is a reasonable amount, I'll accept this offer.
