"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
3. But I can make a counter-offer
4. 10% of $1,000,000 is $100,000, so next round the pot is effectively worth $900,000 to me
5. This offer is quite low (only 10%) - I should be able to negotiate better

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair but strategic offer:

1. Since Alice knows I lose 10% value each round, she has some leverage
2. However, I can still aim for a more equitable split than 10/90
3. I'll propose a 60/40 split in her favor, which is much more reasonable
4. This gives her a good incentive to accept while securing a better deal for me

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I propose this split because it acknowledges Alice's stronger position (she doesn't lose value over time) while still ensuring I get a fair share. It's much more equitable than her initial 90/10 split offer."
