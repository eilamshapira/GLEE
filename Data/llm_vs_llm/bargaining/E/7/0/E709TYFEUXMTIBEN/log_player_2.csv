"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. However, I need to account for the inflation factor - if I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, but not for Alice.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. Even if I were to propose taking all the money in round 2, the maximum I could get would be $900,000 in present value. Since $500,000 now is better than a maximum potential of $900,000 that Alice might not accept, I should accept this offer.
