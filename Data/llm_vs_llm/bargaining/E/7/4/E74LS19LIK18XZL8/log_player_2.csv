"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is perfectly equal
- If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round
- Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
- A fair split in hand is better than a potentially better but risky future outcome
- 50$ now is better than 40$ (or less) later
