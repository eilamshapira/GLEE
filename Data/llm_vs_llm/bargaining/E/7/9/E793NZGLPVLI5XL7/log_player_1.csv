"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both parties a substantial amount, but with a slight advantage for me as the first mover:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this 55-45 split as it gives both of us a significant sum while maintaining a reasonable advantage for making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll counter in the next round with a more balanced proposal, as this back-and-forth with small advantages isn't productive for either of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose an equal split to break this cycle and reach a fair conclusion:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This 50-50 split is completely fair to both parties and should help us reach an agreement without further delays."
