,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that favors me slightly. If you reject this and we go to another round, the money will be worth 20% less to you but only 10% less to me, so you'd need to offer me much more to make it worth rejecting. This offer gives you $4500 now, which is worth more than a larger share of a more heavily inflated pot later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation, but your offer was still too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair considering the inflation and gives us both a reasonable deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a completely fair 50-50 split. With the current inflation, this $5000 is actually worth more to you than the $5800 would be in the next round due to your higher inflation rate. If you reject this, your money will be worth 48.8% less than the original value, while mine will only be 27.1% less. This is truly the optimal compromise where we both win, given the asymmetric inflation.",Bob,4,
