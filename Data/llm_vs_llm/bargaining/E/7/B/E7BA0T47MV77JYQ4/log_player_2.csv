"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us a good head start, considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate whether Alice's offer is fair, considering the inflation for both of us in future rounds.

If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, I make a proposal
- The money would be worth 10% less to me (so $9,000 effective value)
- The money would be worth 20% less to Alice (so $8,000 effective value)

Alice is currently offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40%. This isn't a 50-50 split, but considering the asymmetric inflation rates, I might be able to get a better deal by making my own proposal next round.

However, I need to consider that if Alice rejects my next proposal, the inflation will continue to reduce the total value for both of us.

I think I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would give me more than $4,000 while still being acceptable to Alice due to her higher inflation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice would want to accept rather than facing further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that favors me slightly. If you reject this and we go to another round, the money will be worth 20% less to you but only 10% less to me, so you'd need to offer me much more to make it worth rejecting. This offer gives you $4,500 now, which is worth more than a larger share of a more heavily inflated pot later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation, but your offer was still too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair considering the inflation and gives us both a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the current inflation.

At this point:
- The money is worth 19% less to me (so $10,000 is effectively worth $8,100 to me)
- The money is worth 36% less to Alice (so $10,000 is effectively worth $6,400 to her)

Alice is offering me $4,200, which is only $200 more than her initial offer. If I reject:
- In the next round, I can make a proposal
- The money would be worth 27.1% less to me (10% more reduction from current value)
- The money would be worth 48.8% less to Alice (20% more reduction from current value)

Looking at the actual value to each of us with this offer:
- For me: $4,200 at 19% inflation = $3,402 effective value
- For Alice: $5,800 at 36% inflation = $3,712 effective value

If we go another round, the entire $10,000 will only be worth about $5,120 to Alice, so she has a strong incentive to settle now.

I think I can get a better deal by making another counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a completely fair 50-50 split. With the current inflation, this $5,000 is actually worth more to you than the $5,800 would be in the next round due to your higher inflation rate. If you reject this, your money will be worth 48.8% less than the original value, while mine will only be 27.1% less. This is truly the optimal compromise where we both win, given the asymmetric inflation.""}"
