"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer. Since I'm Alice and going first, I'll propose a fair split but accounting for the fact that delays hurt me more than Bob due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is close to a 50-50 split but gives me a slight advantage as I'm making the first offer. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting to avoid the inflation penalty on further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I accept Bob's offer of $4000, due to the 20% inflation penalty, I would effectively receive $3200 in round 1 value. Meanwhile, Bob would get $6000 at full value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 20% less (worth only 60% of original value). This weakens my negotiating position significantly.

While Bob's offer isn't great for me, the inflation penalty means I should probably accept rather than risk an even worse outcome in later rounds.
