"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ (40%) while keeping 600,000$ (60%) for herself. While this is a substantial amount, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. Given that this is the first round and I would have the opportunity to make the next proposal, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that's still advantageous to me but more likely to be accepted by Alice. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more equitable than her initial offer while still giving me a better position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's fair enough that Alice might accept it, but if she rejects it, she would have to make a new offer in the next round. The risk of further negotiation might encourage her to accept this reasonable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation. Alice has increased her offer from 400,000$ to 425,000$ (a 25,000$ improvement). While this is movement in the right direction, it's still quite far from my previous proposal of a 55-45 split. However, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to round 4 where I can make another offer
2. But Alice has shown she's willing to make only small concessions
3. There's no guarantee that future negotiations will lead to a better outcome
4. The amount offered (425,000$) is still a significant sum

Given that we could potentially enter a long back-and-forth with diminishing returns, and that 425,000$ is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
