Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is tempting, but the fact that her gains are worth significantly less to her this round suggests she might be overvaluing them. It's a gamble, but I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}
``` 

I'm increasing my demand slightly to capitalize on the fact that Alice's potential gains are decreasing in value each round. Let's see if she's feeling the pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation is clearly impacting Alice's side of the deal significantly. While I'd prefer a 65/35 split, accepting 60/40 at this point is better than risking further devaluation of the money and potentially getting a worse deal or nothing at all in the later rounds."
