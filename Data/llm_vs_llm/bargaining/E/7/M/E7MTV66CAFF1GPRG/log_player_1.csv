"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while still being fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: ""I propose a 60-40 split. This gives you $400,000 right now, which is better than risking the 20% inflation penalty in the next round."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer of $550,000, due to the 20% inflation, it's actually worth $440,000 to me (550000 * 0.8)

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   - The money will be worth even less (another 20% less)
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

3. Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable, giving me slightly more than half
   
4. The real value I'm getting ($440,000) is still substantial, and avoiding further inflation risk seems wise
