Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer reflects a fair compromise considering our differing rates of value loss. Let's end this game soon to minimize further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This puts pressure on him to secure a larger share sooner rather than later.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** While Bob's offer in Round 2 was heavily in his favor, his Round 4 offer is more balanced. This shift indicates his growing concern about the shrinking pot.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer in the hopes of securing a slightly better deal in a later round is a risky gamble. The potential gains are minimal compared to the potential losses due to inflation.

By accepting the offer in Round 4, I secure a reasonable share (even though it's less than my initial offer) and avoid the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
