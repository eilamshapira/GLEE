"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $30 while she gets $70 out of the $100. 

If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. The money doesn't lose value for me across rounds (0% inflation for me), but it loses 10% value for Alice each round. This gives me some leverage because time pressure affects Alice more than me.

If we move to round 2, the $100 will still be worth $100 to me, but only $90 to Alice. This suggests I could make a more favorable offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that takes into account the time pressure Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Since the money loses 10% value for Alice each round, the $45 I'm offering her now is actually worth more to her than what she might get in a future round if she rejects my offer. This is a fair division that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than continuing to negotiate and losing more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice has increased her offer to me from $30 to $40, which is an improvement, but still less than my proposal of $55 for myself. For Alice, due to the 19% inflation she's experiencing, her $60 is actually worth only about $48.60 in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where I can make another proposal. At that point, Alice will experience even more inflation (about 27% from the original value), further weakening her position.

Since I don't experience any inflation, I have a strategic advantage by continuing to negotiate. I could likely secure a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has now faced significant inflation (19% from the original value), and will face even more if she rejects this offer, I'll make an offer that's better for me but still reasonable enough that she should accept rather than continuing to lose value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a larger share, but for Alice, the $40 now is worth more than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in future rounds when inflation will have eroded its value even further. The continued 10% inflation per round puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice has now offered me $45, which is an improvement from her previous offers of $30 and $40. However, due to the 34.39% inflation she's experiencing, her $55 is only worth about $36.09 in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 6, where I can make another proposal. At that point, Alice will experience approximately 41% inflation from the original value, further weakening her position.

Since I don't experience any inflation, I maintain my strategic advantage by continuing to negotiate. Given the progression of offers and the increasing inflation pressure on Alice, I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has now faced significant inflation (34.39% from the original value), and will face even more if she rejects this offer, I'll increase my request while still offering Alice enough that accepting should be better than continuing negotiations.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

For Alice, accepting $35 now is likely more valuable than waiting for future rounds when inflation will have eroded the value even further. If we were to go to round 7, she would face approximately 41% inflation, making any subsequent offer worth significantly less to her. This offer represents a rational balance considering our different inflation experiences in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this latest offer from Alice.

Alice is now offering me $50, which is a 50-50 split nominally. However, due to the 46.86% inflation she's experiencing, her $50 is only worth about $26.57 compared to round 1 value. 

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 8, where I can make another proposal. At that point, Alice will face even more inflation (around 52% from the original value).

Based on the progression of offers so far, Alice has gradually improved her offers to me: $30, $40, $45, and now $50. This indicates she's feeling the pressure from inflation. 

Since I don't experience any inflation, continuing to negotiate remains advantageous for me. The trend suggests I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice has now faced substantial inflation (46.86% from the original value), and her offers have been steadily increasing in my favor, I'll make an offer that further benefits me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than continuing to a round where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

For Alice, accepting $30 now may be more valuable than waiting for future rounds when inflation would erode the value even further. If we were to go to round 9, she would face over 52% inflation, making any nominal amount worth significantly less to her. At this point, the time pressure on Alice is substantial, and this offer reflects the strategic advantage I have in this negotiation structure."
