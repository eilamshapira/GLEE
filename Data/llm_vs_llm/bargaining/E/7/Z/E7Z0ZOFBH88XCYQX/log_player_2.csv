"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $42 I gain would be worth $42 * 0.64 = $26.88 in the original value (since it's 36% less, or 100% - 64% = 36% less).

However, if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the inflation would further reduce the value of my potential gain.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.
