"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money for me is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value, and for Bob, it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll take this into account.
