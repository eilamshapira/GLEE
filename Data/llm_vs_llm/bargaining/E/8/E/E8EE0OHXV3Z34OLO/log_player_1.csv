"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip it this time. 60/40 for me, it's fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, but its value will be 20% less than the original $4000. So, the effective value I'll get is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a counteroffer in the next round, and the value of the money will decrease further due to inflation.

Given the options, I think it's better to accept Bob's offer.
