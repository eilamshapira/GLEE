"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. If we keep delaying, we'll both lose money due to the 10% inflation each round, so this is the optimal solution for maximum collective gain. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
