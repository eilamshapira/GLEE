"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally at 50-50. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid the 20% inflation that affects me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $500,000 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $400,000
* If I reject and make a new offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less due to inflation
* Even if I could get a larger share in the next round, the inflation would likely offset any gains

Given this, I should accept this offer as further delays will only reduce my effective gains.
