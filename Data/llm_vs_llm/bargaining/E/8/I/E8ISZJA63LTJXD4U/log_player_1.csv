Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the most fair division. We both contribute equally to this game, so an equal split makes the most sense. This way we both walk away with the same amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
