"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems like a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her, or reject it and make my own proposal in the next round.

While I could get more by rejecting and proposing a different split in the next round, there's also risk in continuing the game. Alice is offering me 40% of the total, which isn't an even split but still represents a significant portion.

After considering the offer, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the most fair division. We both contribute equally to this game, so an equal split makes the most sense. This way we both walk away with the same amount.""}"
