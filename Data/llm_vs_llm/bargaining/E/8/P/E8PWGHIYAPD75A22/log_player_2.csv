"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to split the $100 so that I keep $60 and you get $40. Let's settle now to avoid the inflation bite on my shareâ€”this way we both avoid dragging the game on longer than necessary. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $100 * 0.95 = $95 total value for me next round
   * Even if I propose a better split next round, Alice might reject

The current offer of $40 is less than half, but it's not terrible. If I reject and we go another round, even if I propose a 50-50 split, I'd get $47.50 (50% of $95), and Alice might reject that anyway.

Given the inflation risk and uncertainty about future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
