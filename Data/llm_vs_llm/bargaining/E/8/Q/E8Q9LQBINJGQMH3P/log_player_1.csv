"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest an even split of the money. We each get $50, which seems fair to start with. This way we can both walk away with a good amount rather than risk losing value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round, my $40 now is worth more than potentially getting less in future rounds. Also, knowing that Bob faces 20% inflation per round gives me insight that he's likely motivated to finish this deal now too. A reasonable split that gives me 40% of the total amount is acceptable given these inflation pressures."
