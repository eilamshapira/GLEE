Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the 5% depreciation per round for me.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty each round while you don't lose value. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my losses. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
