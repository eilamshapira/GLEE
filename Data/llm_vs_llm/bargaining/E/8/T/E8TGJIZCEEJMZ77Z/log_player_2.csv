"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering an equal 50-50 split of the money, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair initial offer, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the $1,000,000 would only be worth $900,000 to me. Even if I were to get a larger percentage in the next round, I'd need to secure more than 55.6% (more than $556,000) to beat the current $500,000 offer.

Given the fairness of Alice's initial proposal and the risk of inflation reducing the value in subsequent rounds, I'll accept.
