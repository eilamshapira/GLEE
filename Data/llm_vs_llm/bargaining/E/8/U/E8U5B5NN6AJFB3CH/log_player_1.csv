"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that delay will cost me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while being slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move and delay would hurt me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. Even with inflation, I can try for a better split in the next round. A 40-60 split gives Bob too much advantage, especially since the total value is still $100 and my portion would only be reduced by 10% in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering we're now in round 3, and the value of my gains will be reduced by 20% compared to round 1, I need to adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the inflation effect. If Bob rejects this, any future gains will be worth even less for both of us, so this offer gives us both an incentive to conclude the negotiation now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's my reasoning:
1. The money is losing value quickly - my $42 is worth about $30.62 (considering 27.1% inflation from round 1)
2. If I reject, we go to round 5 where my gains will be worth even less
3. Bob's position is actually worse than mine due to his higher inflation rate (48.8%), so his $58 is worth less than it appears
4. We're already in round 4 of 12, and continuing to reject offers risks getting nothing if we reach round 12
5. This offer is better than Bob's previous offer (42 vs 40)

The diminishing value of money makes it rational to accept this compromise now rather than risk further losses through continued negotiation."
