"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the $5000 Alice gains is now worth less than in the previous round. My effective gain is now significantly reduced. I must evaluate Bob's offer based on the value *I* perceive.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Considering the cumulative inflation of 27.1%, my gains are significantly devalued. The $4500 offered to me now is worth much less than it was initially.

Given the decreasing value of my potential gains, and comparing it to my initial offer, I have to make a difficult decision.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. Inflation is a significant factor now, so I need to be more strategic:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has significantly eroded the value of my potential gains. At this point, I need to consider the potential for future rounds and the rapidly diminishing value of my share. The $4000 offered is now significantly less valuable than at the start.

Given the circumstances, my best decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 7, and inflation is really eating into the value. I need to make a more assertive offer to try and secure a reasonable share before the money becomes almost worthless to me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is now crippling. The $3500 offered to me is worth less than half of what it was initially. I have to consider if it's worth risking another round, knowing the offer might get even worse, or whether to take what I can get, given the current circumstances.

This is a difficult decision, but considering the rate of inflation...

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, in round 9, I'm going to make a final, and potentially more aggressive, offer, given the continued devaluation of the money.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5050,
  ""bob_gain"": 4950
}
```"
