"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an even split of $500,000 each. While this appears fair on the surface, the game has an important detail: inflation affects Alice more than me. With each round, the money loses 5% value for Alice but 0% for me. This means I have a strategic advantage if we go to another round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice would rationally accept a less favorable deal in the next round since her potential gain would be worth less to her. Given this inflation asymmetry, I can likely secure a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 50-50 split, I should now propose a division that accounts for the inflation asymmetry. Because Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I face none, she has an incentive to accept a less favorable offer now rather than waiting.

If we went to a third round, Alice's value would decrease by another 5%, meaning a dollar in round 3 would be worth about 90.25% of its current value to her. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice should rationally accept rather than face further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice $450,000, which is less than the initial even split but still substantial. Given that rejecting would mean Alice faces further depreciation of value, this should be an acceptable offer to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in round 3.

Alice is now offering me $480,000 while taking $520,000 for herself. This is less favorable to me than her initial 50-50 split. However, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another offer
2. In round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (approximately 14.3% total from round 1)
3. If Alice rejects my round 4 offer, we'd go to round 5 where she'd face about 19% total inflation

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I have a stronger negotiating position. Alice's current offer gives me less than her initial offer, which doesn't make strategic sense for me to accept when my position is getting stronger.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should now propose a division that takes into account our respective positions. Alice now faces approximately 14.3% inflation compared to round 1, which significantly weakens her negotiating position.

Given this asymmetry, I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice sufficient incentive to accept rather than continue to a fifth round where she would face even greater inflation (around 19%).

{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering Alice $420,000, which is less than her previous offer to me, but considering the inflation she faces, it's in her interest to accept this rather than risk further devaluation of her potential gains. If she rejects, the next round's inflation would reduce her purchasing power even more, weakening her position further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $420,000 while taking $580,000 for herself. This is significantly less favorable to me than her initial 50-50 split and even less than her previous offer of $480,000.

Important considerations:
1. Alice now faces 18.55% inflation compared to round 1
2. If I reject, we move to round 6 where I can make another offer
3. In round 6, Alice will face approximately 22.6% total inflation
4. My money doesn't lose value due to inflation (0% inflation for me)

Alice's offer has become increasingly worse for me with each round, despite her weakening position due to inflation. This suggests she's being aggressive in negotiations, possibly hoping I'll eventually accept.

Given that my negotiating position continues to strengthen with each round, and her offer is now significantly worse than previous rounds:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice has rejected my previous offers and her latest offer was actually worse for me than before, which suggests she's being quite aggressive in these negotiations despite her weakening position due to inflation.

At this point, Alice faces approximately 22.6% inflation compared to round 1. If she rejects this offer and we move to round 7, she'll face around 26.5% inflation. This significantly impacts the value of any money she receives.

Given this dynamic, I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being rational for Alice to accept considering her inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 620000, 
""alice_gain"": 380000}

I'm offering Alice $380,000, which is less than her previous offers, but given the accelerating inflation she faces, accepting $380,000 now is likely better for her than continuing the negotiation. The key factor is that each round reduces the value of her potential gains, while mine remain stable."
