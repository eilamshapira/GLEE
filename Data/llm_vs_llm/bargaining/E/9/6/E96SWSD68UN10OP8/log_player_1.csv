"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rates that Bob and I face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because we both face different inflation rates if we delay. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Bob's 10%), there's an incentive for me to settle sooner. However, I still deserve a fair portion of the total amount. This split gives Bob a substantial amount while recognizing that I should receive a bit more now to compensate for my disadvantage in future rounds."
