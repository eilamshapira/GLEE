50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both losing value to inflation with each round, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly with an even split. This way we both walk away with equal amounts and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
