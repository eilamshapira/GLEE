"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both losing value to inflation with each round, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly with an even split. This way we both walk away with equal amounts and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
