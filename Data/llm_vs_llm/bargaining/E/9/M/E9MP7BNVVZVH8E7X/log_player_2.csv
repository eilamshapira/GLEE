"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer that benefits both of us. 60 for me, 40 for you. This is a fair starting point, considering the pressure of the rounds and potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, since inflation will reduce my money's value by 10% each round. If I reject now and propose next round, the total would only be worth 90% of the original value.

Alice is offering me 40% of the money right away. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I propose a better split for myself, I'll lose 10% value. 

Considering the inflation pressure and the limited number of rounds, I should be strategic.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I need to make a counter-proposal that accounts for the inflation effect while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We're both losing value to inflation with each round, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly with an even split. This way we both walk away with equal amounts and avoid further devaluation.""}"
