"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split. I think this is a fair offer to start with, considering the work we've both put in. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, which is a 40% share. While this isn't an even split, there are a few considerations:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where the total amount will be worth 5% less (9500$)
2. I would get to make the next offer, but Alice could still reject
3. The risk of continued rejection could lead to both of us getting nothing after 12 rounds
4. 4000$ is still a substantial amount

While I could try to negotiate for a more even split, the risk of depreciation and potential further rejections makes this a reasonable offer to consider accepting.
