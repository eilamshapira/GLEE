"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from further rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to avoid further devaluation. This way we both get a fair share and avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $500,000 Ã— 0.9 = $450,000 (due to 10% inflation)
* If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
* Even if I managed to get a larger share in the next round, the inflation would likely offset the gain
* This is a fair 50-50 split, and Bob's reasoning about avoiding further devaluation is sound
