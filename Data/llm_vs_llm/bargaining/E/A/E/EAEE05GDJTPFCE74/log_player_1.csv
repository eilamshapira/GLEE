"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a fair portion while acknowledging my first-mover advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer, my $5000 is actually worth $4500 to me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but then my money will be worth even less (20% less than original value)
3. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and Bob might not accept a better deal for me
4. Getting something is better than risking getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
