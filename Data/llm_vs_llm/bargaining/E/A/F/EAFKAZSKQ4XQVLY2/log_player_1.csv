Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's better to split it equally, considering the inflation risk for both of us. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I understand the need for a fair split, but considering the inflation risk, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a significant amount.""
}
```

Explanation:
- **Alice gain:** $5400
- **Bob gain:** $4600

Considering the inflation, the real value for Alice is:
- Round 1: $5500 (no inflation)
- Round 2: $5000 (10% inflation)
- Round 3: $4860 (20% inflation)

The offer considers the cumulative effect of inflation on Alice's gains while trying to maintain a reasonable split for Bob."
