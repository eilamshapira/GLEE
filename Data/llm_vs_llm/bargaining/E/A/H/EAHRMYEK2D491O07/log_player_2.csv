"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer: $475,000 for me, $525,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Due to 5% inflation for Alice (but not for me):
   - Next round, $1 will be worth $0.95 for Alice
   - I can use this to my advantage
4. Alice's $525,000 would only be worth ~$499,000 to her next round
5. I could offer a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage. I'll offer a split that gives me more while still being reasonable for Alice to accept, considering that if she rejects, her share will be worth even less in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is fair because:
1. If Alice rejects, in the next round her money will be worth 5% less
2. Even though my offer gives her less nominal dollars than her initial offer, it's better for her to accept now than to face further devaluation
3. The split is still reasonable and not extremely lopsided"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. For me, this is worth full $500,000
3. For Alice, due to 9.75% inflation, her $500,000 is actually worth about $451,250
4. If I reject:
   - Next round the inflation for Alice will be around 14.25%
   - I could offer a more favorable split for me
   - However, there's a risk of continued back-and-forth reducing total value

The offer is substantially better than her first offer ($475,000). Given the risk of prolonged negotiation and the decent amount offered, I'll accept.
