4873.0,5127.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair approach in round 1. To keep our gains high and minimize further losses due to inflation, I'm proposing this division based on our future prospects: you receive $4873, which reflects what you'd expect as the proposer in the next round (discounted by 5%), and I take $5127. This offer is fair given the cost of delay. I look forward to a quick agreement!",Bob,2,
