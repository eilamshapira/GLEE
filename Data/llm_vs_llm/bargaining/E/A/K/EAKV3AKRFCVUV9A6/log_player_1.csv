"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair approach in round 1. To keep our gains high and minimize further losses due to inflation, I'm proposing this division based on our future prospects: you receive $4873, which reflects what you'd expect as the proposer in the next round (discounted by 5%), and I take $5127. This offer is fair given the cost of delay. I look forward to a quick agreement! 
# Alice gain: 4873 
# Bob gain: 5127 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, we move to round 3 where:
- I can make a new offer
- The total amount will be worth 10% less than the original
- So we'd be dividing the equivalent of $9,000
- Even if I propose a 60/40 split in my favor then, I'd get around $5,400, but worth 10% less = $4,860

2. Bob's current offer:
- Gives me $4,873
- Is already adjusted for the 5% inflation
- Is guaranteed if I accept now
- Is actually slightly higher than what I could expect in the next round

Given this analysis, I should accept. The offer is fair considering the inflation penalty, and trying to negotiate further would likely leave me worse off.
