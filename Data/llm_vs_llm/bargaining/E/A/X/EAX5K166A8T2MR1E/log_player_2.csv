"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me to reflect the time pressure on my end. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is relatively fair, giving me 47.5% of the total.
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the $10,000 will be worth $9,500 for me.
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject, leading to further inflation.
4. The current offer gives me $4,750, which is better than risking further rounds with inflation.
5. The split is close enough to 50-50 that the difference ($500) is less than what I'd lose to inflation in negotiations.
