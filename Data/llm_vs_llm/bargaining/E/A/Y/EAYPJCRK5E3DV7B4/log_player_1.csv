"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose an offer that considers both our interests, acknowledging that time works against us both (especially me with the higher inflation rate).

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both lose if we delay, and you still get a substantial portion. Let's avoid the value deterioration that would happen in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4,500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4,050
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
- Making future negotiations even harder and potentially resulting in even less value for both of us

While this isn't as much as I hoped for, the inflation penalty makes further negotiation risky. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
