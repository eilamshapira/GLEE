"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * This gives me some negotiating leverage since Alice loses more value per round

The current split is 40/60 in Alice's favor. Given that I have the advantage of a lower inflation rate, I can probably get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice is losing value faster than me (10% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than risk another round where she loses more value.

For Alice, waiting another round would mean her money is worth 10% less, so she should be motivated to accept a fair offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more favorable to me than the original 40/60 split
2. For Alice, $4500 now is better than risking a worse deal next round when her money is worth 10% less
3. It's still a reasonable offer that doesn't appear greedy or likely to trigger a spite-based rejection"
