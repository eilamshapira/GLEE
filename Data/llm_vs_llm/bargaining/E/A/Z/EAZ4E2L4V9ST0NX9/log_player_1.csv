Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 55/45 split, recognizing the inflation difference, but also acknowledging the time value of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
