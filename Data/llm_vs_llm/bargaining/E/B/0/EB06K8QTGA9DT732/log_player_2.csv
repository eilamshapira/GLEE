"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more to account for the faster inflation against me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game and Alice's proposal.

Considering the inflation rates (5% for me, 10% for her) and the urgency of reaching an agreement, I need to decide if 40$ now is better than risking a lower amount later.

Let's consider what might happen if I reject:

*   **I propose in round 2:** I'll have to offer Alice something she finds acceptable after her 10% inflation.
*   **Risk:** Rejection in later rounds means the money dwindles significantly for both of us.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the initial offer isn't terrible. Given the pressure of inflation and the time limit, a guaranteed 40$ might be the most pragmatic choice.
