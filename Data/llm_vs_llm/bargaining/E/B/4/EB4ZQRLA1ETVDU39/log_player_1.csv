"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering you face a 5% devaluation per round while I don't. Taking this deal now maximizes your actual value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a fairer share of 47.5% for me and 52.5% for you. This is a good increase for you while ensuring I still get a reasonable amount considering the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Bob offers me $525,000, which is less than my initial proposal but still a majority share
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
  - I can make another offer
  - But Bob's share will be worth another 5% less to him
  - This gives me more leverage, but also risks further back-and-forth

Since I'm being offered a majority share and we could risk prolonging negotiations while Bob's position weakens, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
