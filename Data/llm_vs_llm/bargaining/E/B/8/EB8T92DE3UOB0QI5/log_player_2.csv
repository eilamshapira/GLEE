"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the time value of money. Take it while it's still worth something!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I propose we adjust to 4500 for me and 5500 for you. This way, we both feel the fairness despite the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable.  While I'd prefer my original offer, accepting this prevents further losses due to inflation for both of us."
