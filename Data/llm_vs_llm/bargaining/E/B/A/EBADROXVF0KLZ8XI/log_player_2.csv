"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Alice's offer, I'll need to evaluate if it's fair given the inflation factor.

The offer gives me $400,000 (40%) and Alice $600,000 (60%) of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value for me will be worth 10% less due to inflation. This means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would only be worth $900,000 to me. So I would need to get more than $400,000/$900,000 â‰ˆ 44.4% of the next round's money to be better off.

Given that I'm not sure how inflation affects Alice, and that I'm still getting a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer rather than risk a worse outcome after inflation.
