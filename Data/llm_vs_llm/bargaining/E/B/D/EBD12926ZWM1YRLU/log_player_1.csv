Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though it's not a perfect split, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value with each round. Accepting a slightly unfavorable offer now is better than risking a worse offer later.
* **Bob's Unknown Inflation:** We don't know how inflation is affecting Bob. He might be more resistant to moving further in my favor.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more favorable terms in future rounds. 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer secures a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value."
