# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While not ideal, I need to aim for a better split. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes. I'm hoping Alice will become more open to a fairer deal as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This offer is fair and avoids further losses for both of us.""}"

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice's offer is getting closer to acceptable, but the inflation is eating into the potential gains rapidly. I need to hold out for a bit more, hoping she feels the pressure too."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, Bob! Take this offer and we both win. We're both losing money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to accept anything less than a 50/50 split, but the inflation is killing us. Better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all in the end."
