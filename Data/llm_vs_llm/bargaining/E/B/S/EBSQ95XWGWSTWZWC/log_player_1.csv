"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

I am aiming slightly higher than Bob's offer, acknowledging the time pressure while still seeking a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, let's end this with a favorable deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This offer is worse than his initial offer, even considering the decreased value for Bob. I believe holding out for a better deal is still worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  Let's be realistic and end this negotiation.""

I am lowering my demand slightly, recognizing the time pressure. However, I'm holding firm on a majority share, as time is impacting Bob more than me.  The ""final offer"" statement is a calculated risk to add pressure and prompt a decision."
