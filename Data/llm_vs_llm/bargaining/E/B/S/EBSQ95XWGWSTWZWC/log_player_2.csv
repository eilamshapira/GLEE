"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects our positions in the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll make a competitive offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing, Bob. Let's settle this quickly with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 450000 * 0.9025 = 406125. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less than the previous round, which was already 9.75% less than the initial round), I'll make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

The total decrease in value for me is 1 - (0.95 * 0.95) = 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975 or 9.75% in the first two rounds, and now another 5%: 0.95 * 0.9025 = 0.857375, which means the money is worth approximately 14.26% less for me than in the first round.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Time is money, let's end this with a favorable deal for me""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Let's be realistic and end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 475000 * 0.8145 = 386977.5. 

Given that this is Alice's final offer and the value of the money will continue to decrease for me, I should accept this offer to avoid further losses.
