"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer for the first round, considering that inflation affects me by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000. This gives us both an equal share of $5,000 each, which I believe is fair for both of us."
