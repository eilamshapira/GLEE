"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand that I'm playing as Alice in this negotiation game. Given that Bob faces a 10% devaluation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage but should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a firm but fair starting offer, giving Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $5,500 and keeps $4,500
2. For Bob, his $4,500 is actually worth only $4,050 (90% of original value) due to 10% inflation
3. My $5,500 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less (80% of original value)
5. This is actually a quite reasonable offer considering we started with my 60-40 split

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair compromise that gives me a good portion ($5,500) while still being reasonable for Bob, and continuing the negotiation might lead to unnecessary value destruction due to inflation."
