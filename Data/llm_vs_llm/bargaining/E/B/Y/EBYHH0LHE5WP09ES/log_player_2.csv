"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money is worth 5% less each round, and mine stays the same:

1. Current offer: I get $500,000, Alice gets $500,000
2. If we go to next round:
   * Alice's value of money decreases by 5%
   * I could offer something like $450,000 for me, $550,000 for her
   * For her, that $550,000 would only be worth $522,500 due to 5% depreciation
   * She would likely reject that, leading to more rounds and further depreciation

The current 50-50 split is fair, but I can probably get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer, taking advantage of the depreciation factor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money is worth 5% less this round, I can offer her slightly more in nominal terms while actually getting a better deal for myself. She should rationally accept this offer because waiting another round will decrease her money's value further.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. For Alice, due to the 5% depreciation, her $450,000 is worth $427,500 in round 1 terms. If she rejects, we go to another round where her money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable offer for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. I'm offered $525,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Alice gets $475,000 (worth only 90.25% of original value to her due to 9.75% depreciation)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round, Alice's money will be worth ~14.25% less
   * I could try for a better split, but:
     * Alice might reject again
     * We're getting closer to a reasonable equilibrium
   * Current deal is already better than the initial 50-50 split

Since I've already improved from the initial 50-50 offer to getting $525,000, and there's risk in pushing further, I'll accept this offer.
