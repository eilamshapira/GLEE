"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good amount while encouraging Bob to accept rather than risk the 20% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which signals fairness
2. I'm taking slightly more as the first mover
3. If Bob rejects, the total amount will drop to $8,000 in the next round, making us both worse off"
