"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so the money is at full value. Alice is offering me $4,500, which is 45% of the total amount, while she would keep $5,500 (55%).

While this isn't an even 50-50 split, it's reasonably close. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (only $8,000 total). Even if I then proposed a more favorable split for myself, we risk further devaluation if Alice rejects.

$4,500 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie later.
