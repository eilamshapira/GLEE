Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money for both of us, but especially for you with the inflation hitting you harder. I'm offering a compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is right about time being money, her offer is getting worse for me with each round. It's better to hold out and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
