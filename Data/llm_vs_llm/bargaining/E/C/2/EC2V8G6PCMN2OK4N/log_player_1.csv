"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me and the need to secure a deal early on:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

My reasoning is that a larger share for me in the early rounds is crucial due to the immediate inflation impact. I'm offering Bob a substantial $300,000, which is a good amount and hopefully attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him. Considering the 20% inflation that has already hit my potential gains, I need to calculate the actual value of his offer to me.

$400,000 * 0.80 = $320,000 (the actual value of the offer to me)

Given the risk of further inflation and the potential for no deal at all, I'm going to accept his offer.
