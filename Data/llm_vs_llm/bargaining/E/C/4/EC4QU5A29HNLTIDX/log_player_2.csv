"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000$ for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With 20% inflation per round, if I reject now, any future gains will be worth less to me. The current offer is a fair 50-50 split, giving me $500,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the 20% inflation means my money would be worth less. For example, even if I got $600,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $480,000 to me due to inflation.

Given this, accepting a fair 50-50 split in the first round before any inflation kicks in is the most rational choice.
