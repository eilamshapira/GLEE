"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round, inflation will reduce the money's value by 20% for me. This means in the next round, we'd effectively be dividing $800,000 from my perspective.

If I were to counter-offer in the next round and propose an even split, I'd get $400,000, but after accounting for the 20% inflation, that would only be worth $320,000 to me now.

Since $400,000 now is better than potentially $320,000 (or less) later, I should accept this offer.
