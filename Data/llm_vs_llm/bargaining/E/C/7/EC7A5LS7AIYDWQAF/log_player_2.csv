"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly so that we both benefit equally from the start. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. At first glance, a 50-50 split seems fair. However, with the 20% inflation penalty per round, I need to consider my options carefully.

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me. So if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get significantly more than 50$ to make up for the inflation loss.

Current offer: $50
Same amount next round would be worth: $40 (due to 20% inflation)

The 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable, especially considering we have the inflation factor and a limited number of rounds. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing, and I'll lose value each round due to inflation.
