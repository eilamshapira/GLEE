6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation, which affects me more heavily than you (20% vs 5% per round).",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, let's split it equally at $5000 each, which is fair for both of us considering the inflation differences.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% inflation I face each round versus your 5%, I need a bigger share to achieve fair real value. This 58-42 split is actually quite reasonable when accounting for our different inflation rates. If we keep going, we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Alice, let's try this split. You still get a larger amount, which helps offset the higher inflation you face.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're both losing value rapidly. I've already lost 48.8% to inflation while you've only lost 14.26%. I'm compromising from my previous position with a 56-44 split. This helps offset my much higher inflation rate. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Hey Alice, we're both feeling the pressure from inflation. This offer gives you a bit more to help offset your higher inflation rate. Hope this works for both of us.",Bob,6,
