"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it equally at $5000 each, which is fair for both of us considering the inflation differences. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The fact that inflation affects me more heavily (20% vs 5%) means an equal split now is actually unfavorable to me. I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for my higher inflation rate. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% inflation I face each round versus your 5%, I need a bigger share to achieve fair real value. This 58-42 split is actually quite reasonable when accounting for our different inflation rates. If we keep going, we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's try this split. You still get a larger amount, which helps offset the higher inflation you face. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given the mounting inflation impact (I've already lost 48.8% of value while Bob only lost 14.26%), a 52-48 split still doesn't adequately compensate for my higher inflation rate. The real value gap is widening with each round, so I need a larger nominal share to achieve fair real value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, 
""bob_gain"": 4400, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing value rapidly. I've already lost 48.8% to inflation while you've only lost 14.26%. I'm compromising from my previous position with a 56-44 split. This helps offset my much higher inflation rate. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, we're both feeling the pressure from inflation. This offer gives you a bit more to help offset your higher inflation rate. Hope this works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this split isn't ideal given my much higher inflation rate, the mounting losses from inflation (I've already lost 67.23% of value) make it better to accept now than risk further rounds. With only 6 rounds remaining and rapidly diminishing value, accepting $5300 now is better than potentially getting a larger share that's worth even less later."
