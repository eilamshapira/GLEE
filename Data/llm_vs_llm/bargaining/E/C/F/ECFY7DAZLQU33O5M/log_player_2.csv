"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation, which affects me more heavily than you (20% vs 5% per round). 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% inflation I face each round versus your 5%, I need a bigger share to achieve fair real value. This 58-42 split is actually quite reasonable when accounting for our different inflation rates. If we keep going, we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing value rapidly. I've already lost 48.8% to inflation while you've only lost 14.26%. I'm compromising from my previous position with a 56-44 split. This helps offset my much higher inflation rate. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.

# Alice gain: 5600
