45.0,55.0,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since I face 10% inflation each round and you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me at 55-45. This is still fair considering the inflation risk I face.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Considering your inflation risk, I'm willing to compromise, but 55-45 is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with 58-42",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest possible division, and with my 27.1% inflation penalty, my real value is already significantly reduced. Further negotiations would hurt me much more than you due to increasing inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
57.0,43.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I still think 50-50 is too generous. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think 57-43 is a more reasonable split considering the circumstances",Alice,5,
