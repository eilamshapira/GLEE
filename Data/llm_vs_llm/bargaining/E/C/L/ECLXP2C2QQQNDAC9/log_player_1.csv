Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since I face 10% inflation each round and you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me at 55-45. This is still fair considering the inflation risk I face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest possible division, and with my 27.1% inflation penalty, my real value is already significantly reduced. Further negotiations would hurt me much more than you due to increasing inflation.
