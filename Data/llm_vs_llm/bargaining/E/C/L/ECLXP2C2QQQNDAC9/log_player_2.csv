"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, I'm open to negotiations 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
While 40$ isn't terrible, I have to consider that:
1. I can make a counter-offer next round
2. The 10% inflation only affects my share
3. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be more patient

In round 2, I could offer something better for myself. Even with 10% inflation, I could potentially get more than 40$.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's better for me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

With inflation, if Alice rejects this and we go another round, my share would be worth 10% less, so I need to make a strategic offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since I face 10% inflation each round and you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me at 55-45. This is still fair considering the inflation risk I face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your inflation risk, I'm willing to compromise, but 55-45 is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with 58-42 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 19% inflation, the 42$ offered would be worth about 34$ to me in real value
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll face 27.1% inflation next round
3. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, moving from 60-40 to 58-42
4. However, the real value I'm being offered is less than her initial offer

Given the increasing inflation penalty and that we still have many rounds left to potentially lose everything, I should consider accepting. However, I think there's still room for one more negotiation round where I might get a better deal, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With 27.1% inflation affecting my share now, I need to be careful. Making an aggressive offer might lead to more rejections, which would severely hurt my final value due to inflation. However, I still want to improve upon Alice's last offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest possible division, and with my 27.1% inflation penalty, my real value is already significantly reduced. Further negotiations would hurt me much more than you due to increasing inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I still think 50-50 is too generous. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think 57-43 is a more reasonable split considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:
1. The 43$ with 34.39% inflation means I'd get about 28.2$ in real value
2. If I reject, next round I'll face 41% inflation
3. Alice has moved only slightly from her previous offer (58-42 to 57-43)
4. We're now 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds left
5. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant

While Alice's movement is small, the increasing inflation penalty is severely hurting my negotiating position. If I reject, any potential gains would be significantly eroded by the 41% inflation in the next round. Even if I got a 50-50 split accepted in the next round, with 41% inflation I'd only get about 29.5$ in real value - barely better than accepting now.
