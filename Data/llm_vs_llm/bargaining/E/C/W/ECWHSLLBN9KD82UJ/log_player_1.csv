"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly higher split in my favor, considering I'll lose value in future rounds due to inflation while Bob won't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45, which is fairly close to an even split but accounts for my inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I'll get $48, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $45.60 to me
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any money will be worth 10% less to me
- My best next offer would suffer from that 10% inflation penalty
- $45.60 is still a decent amount, and the inflation risk makes further negotiation risky
