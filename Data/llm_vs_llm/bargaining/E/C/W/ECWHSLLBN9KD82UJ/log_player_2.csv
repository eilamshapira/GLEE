"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $45 while keeping $55 for herself. If I reject this offer:
1. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. The money will be worth 5% less to Alice (but same value to me)
3. This means Alice would value $55 as only $52.25 in the next round

Since I can likely negotiate a better deal given Alice's time pressure from inflation, and the split isn't particularly favorable to me, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Given that:
1. Money devalues by 5% each round for Alice
2. If Alice rejects my offer, her next proposal would be worth even less to her
3. I should propose a split that's good enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation

I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while still being fair enough that Alice should accept rather than risk another round of 5% devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

This offer gives me a slight majority while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than lose value through inflation."
