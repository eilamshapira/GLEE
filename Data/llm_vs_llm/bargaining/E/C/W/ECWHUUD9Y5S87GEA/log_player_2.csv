Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll explain my reasoning:

While it seems like Alice is offering a fair 50/50 split, inflation is working against me. Accepting 50 dollars now is worse than accepting 55 dollars in the previous round.  I need to push for a slightly better deal to make up for the inflation."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting tight, but I still need to push back against the inflation. Accepting 52 dollars now is barely better than accepting 50 in round 3. I need to aim higher still."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45

It's painful to accept less than what I was aiming for, but the inflation is eating into the value significantly. Accepting 55 dollars now is better than risking getting a worse deal in later rounds."
