"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value for me due to inflation.

    ""alice_gain"": 55,
    ""bob_gain"": 45,
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I know I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. This is a fair deal that avoids value loss for both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further value loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that if I reject and we go to round 3, my money will be worth another 20% less (so only 64% of original value), while Bob's inflation is much lower.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
* I get $50 at 80% value = $40 effective value
* Bob gets $50 at 95% value = $47.50 effective value

If I reject, any amount I get in the next round will be worth significantly less. Even if I managed to get a larger share, the inflation would eat into my gains.
