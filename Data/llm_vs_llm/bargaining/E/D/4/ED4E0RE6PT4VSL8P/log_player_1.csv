"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, a 55-45 split is actually fair. With 5% inflation, your 45 dollars today is equivalent to about 47.4 dollars from last round. Let's agree on this and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
