"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm offering you 40 dollars. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split, which gives me less than half of the money.

Given the inflation rules, there's 0% inflation for me, so the money keeps its full value across rounds. For Alice, the money loses 5% value each round. This gives me a strategic advantage if we continue to future rounds.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Alice would then face a 5% devaluation on whatever amount she receives.

Since I can potentially get a better deal in the next round, and there's no downside for me to wait (0% inflation), I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that considers the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, a 55-45 split is actually fair. With 5% inflation, your 45 dollars today is equivalent to about 47.4 dollars from last round. Let's agree on this and both walk away with a good deal.""}"
