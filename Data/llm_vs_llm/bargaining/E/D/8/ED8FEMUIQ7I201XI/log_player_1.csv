"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation rate for both myself and Bob. Since this is round 1 and I am Alice, I will make the first proposal. I will aim for a slightly more aggressive offer, assuming Bob is rational and understands the value of money decreases significantly for him in later rounds.
