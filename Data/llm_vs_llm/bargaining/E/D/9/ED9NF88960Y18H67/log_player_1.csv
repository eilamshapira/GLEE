"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that's slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk losing value through inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. In this round, due to inflation:
- My $4500 is worth $4050 (90% of original value)
- Bob's $5500 is worth $4400 (80% of original value)

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- Values will decrease further (I'll lose another 10%, Bob another 20%)
- We risk ending up with less total value

3. This offer still gives me a decent amount, and while it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation effects make it reasonable to accept rather than risk further devaluation.
