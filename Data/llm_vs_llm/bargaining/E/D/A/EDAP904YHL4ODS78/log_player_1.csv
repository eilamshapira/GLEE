Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share Alice, but let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a good amount before inflation gets any worse. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation is hitting me harder than it is Bob (apparently!). I need to try to secure a slightly larger portion while it's still worth something."
