"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take $60 and you get $40.  We both win something and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential winnings. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share Alice, but let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and inflation is eating our potential gains.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle this round, but we need to act fast. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although the offer is now more even, I know Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  I can push for a slightly better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a good amount before inflation gets any worse.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. We both know time is not on our side. Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation eats away at even this much. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the same offer as Round 1, but now the inflation is heavily impacting Alice. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal, and I'd rather take a sure $40 than risk getting nothing."
