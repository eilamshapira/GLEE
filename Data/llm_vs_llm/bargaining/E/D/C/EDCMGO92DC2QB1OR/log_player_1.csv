"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my money is worth 20% less. This means for every dollar I get now, it's like getting only $0.80 in the first round.

Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Alice's gain:** $400,000. This is worth $400,000 * 0.80 = $320,000 in terms of the value in Round 1.

I will reject this offer.
