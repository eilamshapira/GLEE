550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that considers our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5%), I'm offering you a substantial portion now. If we delay, we both lose value, so this is a win-win for both of us.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I need to make up for the rapid devaluation I'm facing. This offer still gives you a significant sum.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair and balanced. I understand your concern about devaluation, but remember that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers - you at 20% per round and me at 5%. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate as the total value decreases. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to a deal, but your 50/50 split doesn't cut it for me. This offer recognizes your smaller devaluation rate while ensuring I'm adequately compensated for my losses. Let's be practical and close this deal.",Bob,4,
