"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that considers our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5%), I'm offering you a substantial portion now. If we delay, we both lose value, so this is a win-win for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I need to make up for the rapid devaluation I'm facing. This offer still gives you a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair and balanced. I understand your concern about devaluation, but remember that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers - you at 20% per round and me at 5%. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate as the total value decreases. Let's conclude this reasonably.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a deal, but your 50/50 split doesn't cut it for me. This offer recognizes your smaller devaluation rate while ensuring I'm adequately compensated for my losses. Let's be practical and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
