"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that considers our different inflation rates. Since your money loses value faster (20% vs my 5%), I'm offering you a substantial portion now. If we delay, we both lose value, so this is a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I need to make up for the rapid devaluation I'm facing. This offer still gives you a significant sum.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair and balanced. I understand your concern about devaluation, but remember that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers - you at 20% per round and me at 5%. A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate as the total value decreases. Let's conclude this reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a deal, but your 50/50 split doesn't cut it for me. This offer recognizes your smaller devaluation rate while ensuring I'm adequately compensated for my losses. Let's be practical and close this deal.""}"
