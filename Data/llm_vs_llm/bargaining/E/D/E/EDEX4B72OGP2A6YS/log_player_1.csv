Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that each additional round reduces my share's value by 20%, I'm compelled to propose a deal that minimizes delay. I understand that if you wait, you might secure nearly the full 1000000. To reach a timely agreement and avoid further losses on my end, I'm offering you almost everything while keeping a minimal share for me. I hope you see the advantage of concluding the game now. 
# Alice gain: 999000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
