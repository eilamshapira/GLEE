Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1000, ""alice_gain"": 999000, ""message"": ""Alice, given that each additional round reduces my share's value by 20%, I'm compelled to propose a deal that minimizes delay. I understand that if you wait, you might secure nearly the full 1,000,000. To reach a timely agreement and avoid further losses on my end, I'm offering you almost everything while keeping a minimal share for me. I hope you see the advantage of concluding the game now.""}"
