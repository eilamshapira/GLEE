"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting an even 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. If we delay, we both lose value due to the 5% inflation, so this is optimal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. She makes a valid point about inflation - if I reject, the total value will decrease by 5% in the next round
3. A 50/50 split is generally considered fair
4. If I reject, I could propose a higher split for myself next round, but:
   - The total amount would be reduced to $9,500
   - Alice could then reject my offer, leading to further losses
5. This is a fair first offer that maximizes value for both parties
