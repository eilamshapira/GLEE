"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will make the first offer.

Considering the 20% inflation each round, and that I have 12 rounds to complete the game, I will offer a significant portion to myself now to account for the potential loss.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. I'm facing inflation, and this is round 2. My $1 now is worth 80 cents from round 1.

Bob's offer is: Alice gets $40, Bob gets $60.

I need to decide if $40 now is better than the potential of a worse deal later (considering inflation) or the risk of getting nothing at all if we reach round 12.

Let's analyze:

*   **If I accept:** I get $40. This is better than the amount I might get if I get to negotiate in later rounds.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
