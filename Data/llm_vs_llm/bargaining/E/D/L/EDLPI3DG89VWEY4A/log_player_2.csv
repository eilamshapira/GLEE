"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'm playing as Bob. Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Alice's offer:** I get $45, Alice gets $55.
*   **My situation:** It's round 1, so there's no inflation yet.
*   **My goal:** I want to maximize my earnings, but I also need to consider the risk of further inflation and the possibility of not reaching an agreement.

While $45 isn't ideal, it's a significant amount. If I reject, I risk Alice offering less later, and the money's value decreasing.
