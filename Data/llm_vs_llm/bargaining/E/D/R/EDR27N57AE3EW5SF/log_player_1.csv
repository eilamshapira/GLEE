"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Due to inflation, my money is worth less. Bob's offer is:

*   Alice gain: 50 (worth 10% less than in round 1)
*   Bob gain: 50 (worth 5% less than in round 1)

I need to decide if I accept or reject. While 50 sounds appealing, the money is worth less now.

My decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. The money is worth even less now. I need to make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
