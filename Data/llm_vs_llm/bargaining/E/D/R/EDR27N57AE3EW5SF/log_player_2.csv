"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of 40% for me and 60% for her. Given that inflation affects me at 5% per round and Alice at 10% per round, I need to think strategically.

If I reject and make my own proposal next round, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning my money will be worth 95% of its current value. Alice will face 10% inflation.

Let me calculate if rejecting makes sense:
- Current offer: $40 for me
- If I reject and we eventually agree on a more favorable split next round, I need to get more than $40/0.95 = $42.11 to come out ahead

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice has a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner, which I should consider in my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally at $50 each. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial amount and recognizes that we both lose if we delay too long."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation that has occurred.

Alice has improved her offer to me from $40 to $45, which is a positive move. Given the current inflation, my $45 is now worth about $40.61 (45 Ã— 0.9025) in original round 1 value, which is slightly better than her initial $40 offer.

If I reject and we continue to the next round, my inflation will increase to 14.75% from round 1, further reducing the value of any future agreement. Alice seems to be negotiating reasonably, moving from a 40-60 split to a 45-55 split.

Since she's made a significant concession and the deal is now more equitable, I'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation losses.
