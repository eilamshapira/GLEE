"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while taking $600,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 10% less in the next round
5. The split isn't perfectly equal, but it's reasonable

Given that inflation will reduce the value of any future gains by 10%, and this is a decent offer, I'll accept.
