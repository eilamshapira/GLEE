"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I want to get a good deal, but also ensure Bob accepts to avoid losing everything.

Here's my first offer, trying to be somewhat fair but also account for the potential risk of future rounds:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
