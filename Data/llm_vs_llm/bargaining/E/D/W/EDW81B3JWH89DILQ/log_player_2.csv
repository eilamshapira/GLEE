"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. 4000$ now is better than 4444$ next round (which would be worth 4000$ after inflation)
5. This is a reasonable first offer, considering I might lose value in negotiations
