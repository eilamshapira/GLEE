"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even split of $5,000 each. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, I could propose a better split in round 2, but the total would be worth 10% less to me.

Let me analyze this:
- Current offer: $5,000 for me
- If I reject and propose next round, the maximum I could get is $9,000 (if Alice accepts), but with 10% inflation, that would be worth $8,100 to me

An even split is fair, and rejecting would risk further inflation losses if negotiations continue. I'll accept this offer.
