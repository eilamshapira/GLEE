"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This is a reasonable deal for both of us, especially considering inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $450,000 and she gets $550,000. If I reject this and go to the next round, I'll be facing 20% inflation, meaning my money will be worth less. However, I'll have the opportunity to make my own proposal.

If I calculate the effect of inflation: if I propose an even split ($500,000 each) in the next round, my $500,000 would be worth only $400,000 in today's value (due to 20% inflation).

So Alice's current offer of $450,000 is actually better than what I would get if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round.
