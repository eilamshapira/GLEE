600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair offer considering inflation will hit you harder if we continue.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Given the inflation difference between us, a 70/30 split would be fair, ensuring we both have comparable value in the end. Let's conclude efficiently!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but 70/30 is too high. I'm offering 65/35. This is my final offer. Consider this, or we both lose more value as we continue.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's find a middle ground. A 65/35 split in my favor is a balanced choice given the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's wrap this up amicably.",Bob,4,
