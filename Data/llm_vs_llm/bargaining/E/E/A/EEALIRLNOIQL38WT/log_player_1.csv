"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we divide the $100 with me taking $60 and you receiving $40. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for the fact that I'll lose 20% of my share's value if we need to go to another round."
