"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the $100 evenly at $50 each. How does that sound, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, since we have inflation affecting my share (5% per round), accepting $50 now is better than accepting $50 in later rounds.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my potential gains would already be worth 5% less. And if Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd continue losing value with each round.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and the inflation penalty only affects my share, it's in my best interest to accept now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
