390000.0,610000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the importance of moving this process along and avoiding further inflation—which, at this point, has reduced my share's value by 10% compared to Round 1. To reach an immediate agreement, I'm offering you $610000 and taking $390000. This offer gives you a slightly better position than your previous proposal and spares both of us additional delay and uncertainty. I hope you'll agree that settling now is in our mutual interest. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,3,
