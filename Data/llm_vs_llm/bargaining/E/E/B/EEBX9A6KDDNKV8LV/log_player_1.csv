Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 equally: $500,000 for me and $500,000 for you. Accepting this offer now avoids the effects of time-based inflation on my end, and it sets a fair tone for our negotiations. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm confident we can find a more favorable split.  I'm proposing $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This offer recognizes my role in moving the negotiation forward, and it leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement in later rounds.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3

To reach an immediate agreement, I'm offering you $610,000 and taking $390,000. This offer gives you a slightly better position than your previous proposal and spares both of us additional delay and uncertainty. I hope you'll agree that settling now is in our mutual interest. Looking forward to your response!""}"
