Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equally: $500000 for me and $500000 for you. Accepting this offer now avoids the effects of time-based inflation on my end, and it sets a fair tone for our negotiations. Looking forward to your response!

# Alice gain: 500000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the importance of moving this process along and avoiding further inflationâ€”which, at this point, has reduced my share's value by 10% compared to Round 1. To reach an immediate agreement, I'm offering you $610000 and taking $390000. This offer gives you a slightly better position than your previous proposal and spares both of us additional delay and uncertainty. I hope you'll agree that settling now is in our mutual interest. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 610000 
# Alice gain: 390000
