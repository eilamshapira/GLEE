"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on the backward‐induction equilibrium for an alternating–offer split with waiting costs (5% per round for Alice and 10% for Bob), one can show that if we assume in every future round each player “gets what they deserve” relative to the other’s discounting, then in round 1 when Alice is proposer the equilibrium proposal gives her about 68.97% of the pie and Bob about 31.03%. (In standard Rubinstein–style bargaining the proposer’s share is (1–δ_responder)/(1–δ_A·δ_responder); here with δ_A = 0.95 and δ_B = 0.90, that gives (1–0.90)/(1–0.95×0.90) ≈ 0.6897.)

Thus, for a $10,000 pie the equilibrium proposal in round 1 is approximately:

 Alice: $6,896.55  
 Bob:   $3,103.45

Here is the JSON offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6896.55, ""bob_gain"": 3103.45}

Note that even though there are many subtleties that one can discuss about every round’s discounting, this offer reflects the “fair” outcome in a game where both parties are forward‐looking and know there are only 12 rounds available."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using backward‐induction we can “solve” for the offer that leaves Bob just indifferent between accepting now and waiting one round. (Note that in this game the “value” of a given physical dollar depends on whose round it is; money in round 3 is worth 90% of its face value for you – Alice – and 80% for Bob, while if Bob waits until round 4 his money will be worth only 70% of its face value and yours 85%.) 

Let x be the number of dollars, out of $10,000, that you (Alice) claim in round 3. If Bob accepts your offer then his physical share is (10,000 – x) and his round‐3 “value” is 0.80 · (10,000 – x).

If Bob instead rejects, he becomes the proposer in round 4. In round 4 the “conversion” factors have dropped further: you’ll view dollars at 0.85 and Bob at 0.70. (In effect, Bob “waits” and the dollar “inflates” against him by an extra 10% and for you by 5%.) In round 4 Bob will propose an offer that is optimal for him in equilibrium. Standard alternating–offers analysis (using, for a one–round delay, effective discount factors for the responder computed as 
  δ₍ᴬ₎ = (Alice’s round 4 multiplier)/(Alice’s round 3 multiplier) = 0.85/0.90 ≈ 0.9444 
  δ₍ᴮ₎ = (Bob’s round 4 multiplier)/(Bob’s round 3 multiplier) = 0.70/0.80 = 0.875)
leads to the following result for the proposer’s “physical” share (see, e.g., the Rubinstein bargaining model): when you are proposing the division the equilibrium share is 
  Alice’s share = 1 – [δ₍ᴮ₎(1 – δ₍ᴬ₎)]⁄[1 – δ₍ᴬ₎δ₍ᴮ₎].

(In games like this one the proposer “pushes” as much as possible onto the responder – here, Bob – leaving him just enough to be willing to accept rather than wait one more round.) 

But an even simpler (and equivalent) way to think about it is to “pin down” Bob’s continuation value. In round 4 (as proposer) Bob would secure himself some share of the $10,000. Working out the full equilibrium in round 4 (with the new multipliers for a further delay from round 4 to round 5) gives Bob an approximate continuation value of about 0.70 · 3047 ≈ 2133 “value–points” (that is, in round 4, Bob would get roughly $3047 physically which, multiplied by 0.70, is about 2133 points of value). 

Thus, when you propose in round 3 your offer must give Bob a round–3 value at least equal to 2133. At round 3 his value from an offer is 0.80 times whatever physical dollars he receives. Setting
  0.80 · (10,000 – x) = 2133
implies
  10,000 – x = 2133/0.80 = 2666.25  →  x = 10,000 – 2666.25 = 7333.75.

That is, you should propose that you get $7,333.75 (whose round–3 “worth” to you is 0.90·7333.75) and Bob gets $2,666.25 (worth him 0.80·2666.25 ≈ 2133). Bob is then just indifferent between accepting now or waiting one more round. As the proposer you can “lean” in your favor by making this exact offer.
