Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6896.55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, keeping in mind the inflation that has occurred:

The money is worth 10% less for me now, so my effective share is reduced. For Alice, the money is worth 5% less. To make things clear, I will use the original $10,000 as a reference point. The actual amount I receive will be adjusted later due to inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2666.25 
# Alice gain: 7333.75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, accounting for the accumulated inflation. The original $10,000 is still the reference point.

*   **My Inflation:** After 4 rounds, my money is worth 10% less each round. So my share is effectively worth 1 - (0.10 \* 4) = 60% of its original value. Or, 100% - 36% = 64%. However, as mentioned, I should deduct 10% on each round: round 1: 10%, round 2: 10%, round 3: 10%. That sums up 30% so far. So, my money is worth 70% as in the first round, and 64%, in this round. Let's consider the most recent value.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** For Alice, the value decreases by 5% per round. So, her money is worth 1 - (0.05 \* 4) = 80% of the original value.

I need to propose something that feels acceptable under these circumstances. I will aim to increase my gain compared to Alice's.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 7619 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 6. The inflation is getting significant now.

*   **My Inflation:** The money is worth 10% less each round. So, in round 6, the reduction is approximately 46.86%.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** The money is worth 5% less per round. So the reduction is approximately 26.24%.

I need to make an offer that seems appealing enough to Alice, but still gives me a reasonable share, considering my losses.

{""bob_gain"": 5900, ""alice_gain"": 4100}

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth approximately 56.95% less than in round 1.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** Alice's money is worth approximately 35.61% less than in round 1.

I will try to make a more attractive offer than the previous rounds, but still ensure I get a reasonable share. Considering the inflation, I need to get a bigger share.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth approximately 65.13% less than in round 1.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** Alice's money is worth approximately 41.07% less than in round 1.

I'll propose an offer that I believe Alice should accept given the time constraints and the devaluation of the money.
