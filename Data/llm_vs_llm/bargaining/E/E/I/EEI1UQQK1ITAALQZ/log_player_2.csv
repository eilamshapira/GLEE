"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair start, let's see if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * Maximum value for me next round: $9000 (10000 - 10%)
   * Maximum value for Alice next round: $8000 (10000 - 20%)

Given that:
* The current offer gives me $4000
* Even if I make a very aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it
* There's a significant risk in waiting due to inflation
* The 40/60 split isn't terribly unfair
