"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the option to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split it 55/45, which gives both of us a substantial amount while being reasonably fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 10% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's only worth $45 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. Bob is offering an equal split, which is fair, but the inflation makes it less favorable for me
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Even though the inflation affects me negatively, this is still a reasonable offer and the risk of continued negotiation might not be worth it.
