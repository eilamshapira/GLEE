"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. If I were to propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $5,000, but with the 20% devaluation, that's equivalent to $4,000 in current value - which is less than Alice's current offer.

Since Alice's offer of $4,500 is better than what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round after accounting for inflation, I should accept.
