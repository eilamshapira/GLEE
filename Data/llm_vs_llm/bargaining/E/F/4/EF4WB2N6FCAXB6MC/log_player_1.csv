"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (using each player’s “discount rate” – 10% per round for you and 5% per round for Bob – and assuming both players act rationally over the 12 rounds) the subgame‐perfect division in round 1 turns out to be approximately as follows:

• Alice receives about 2,101.28 dollars.
• Bob receives about 7,898.72 dollars.

In words, if you (Alice) propose that split in round 1, Bob is exactly indifferent between accepting now and waiting to make his own offer in round 2 (when his “money‐value” is discounted by 5% once). (Any “epsilon” adjustments aside, this is the equilibrium offer.) 

Here is the JSON formatted offer:

{""alice_gain"": 2101.28, ""bob_gain"": 7898.72}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
