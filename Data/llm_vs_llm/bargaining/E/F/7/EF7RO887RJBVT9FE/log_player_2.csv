"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me
3. My $50 would become $45 in the next round
4. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it
5. This is a reasonable first offer
