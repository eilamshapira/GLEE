"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 5%). This division is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significant value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering we both lose value with each round, an equal split now seems fair, saving us from further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
