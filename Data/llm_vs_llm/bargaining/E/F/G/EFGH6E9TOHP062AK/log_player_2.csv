"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 5%). This division is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significant value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
