Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is much more balanced than your previous offer, and considering the inflation effect on my end, it's reasonable. Let's conclude this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
