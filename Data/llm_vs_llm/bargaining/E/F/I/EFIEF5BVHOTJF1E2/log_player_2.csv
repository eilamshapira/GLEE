"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10. It's a fair deal for both of us. I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is not a good offer for me. I would only get 10% ($100,000) while Alice gets 90% ($900,000). Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round, I should still try to negotiate for a better deal. Even with inflation, I could potentially get more in the next round by making my own proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that the money is now worth 20% less to me, but I still need a fair share.

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is much more balanced than your previous offer, and considering the inflation effect on my end, it's reasonable. Let's conclude this fairly.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still hoping for a more equitable split.  Let's do 60/40 in my favor, considering the inflation we've both experienced.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us to both get a decent amount.  
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. My $400,000 is worth only 64% of its original value due to 36% inflation, so effectively I'm getting $256,000 in round 1 value.

2. If I reject and we go to round 4, my money will be worth even less (around 49% less than original value).

3. This offer (40%) is significantly better than Alice's initial offer (10%), and while not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given the inflation pressure I'm under.

4. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to the accelerating inflation effect on my side.
