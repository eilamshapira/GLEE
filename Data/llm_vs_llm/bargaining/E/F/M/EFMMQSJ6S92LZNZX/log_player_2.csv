"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. Since this is the first round, if I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me then.

If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but Alice might reject it too, leading to further rounds and more devaluation for me.

Given the time pressure (12 rounds maximum) and the 10% devaluation per round for me only, I should be strategic about when to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer that's fair considering the game dynamics and the inflation pressure on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This is fair and reasonable, especially considering that the money loses value for me with each round but not for Alice. An equal division respects both our interests while acknowledging the time pressure we're under."
