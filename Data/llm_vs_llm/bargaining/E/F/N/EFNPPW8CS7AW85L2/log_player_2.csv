"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's offering me $550,000 (55%) while taking $450,000 (45%) for herself. This is a generous initial offer that gives me the majority share. Since there's no inflation affecting me, my money won't lose value over rounds, but I don't know if Alice faces inflation pressure.

Given that this is a fair offer above 50% in my favor, and considering we could both end up with nothing if we fail to reach agreement within 12 rounds, I'll accept this proposal.
