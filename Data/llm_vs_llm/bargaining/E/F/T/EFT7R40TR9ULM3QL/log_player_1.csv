"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Since we both need to agree on a fair distribution, I think it's reasonable for me to propose a 60-40 split. This gives both of us a significant portion of the money while slightly favoring my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us both an equal share of the $100, and it's better for both of us to reach an agreement now rather than risk losing everything by extending negotiations."
