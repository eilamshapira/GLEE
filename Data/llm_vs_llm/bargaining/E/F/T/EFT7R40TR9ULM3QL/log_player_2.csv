"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While an even 50-50 split would be fair, this initial offer isn't terrible. However, since we have multiple rounds available, I can make a counter-offer if I reject this one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a balanced counter-offer that's fair for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of $50 each, which is the fairest division possible."
