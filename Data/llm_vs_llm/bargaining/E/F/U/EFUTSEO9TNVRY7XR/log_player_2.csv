"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $20 while keeping $80 for herself. I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
2. For Alice, money loses 20% value each round
3. In the next round, $80 would only be worth $64 to Alice

Since Alice's money loses significant value each round while mine doesn't, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. She should be more willing to accept a higher offer to me in this round rather than wait and lose value.

I'll reject this uneven split and make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I know Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I can make a strategic offer. In this round, $100 is still worth $100 to me, but only worth $80 to Alice.

I'll propose a more balanced split, but one that takes into account that Alice has more pressure to accept due to her depreciation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more equitable than Alice's initial offer
2. For Alice, $40 now is better than a potential larger sum next round (which would be worth 20% less to her)
3. It gives me a fair share while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept"
