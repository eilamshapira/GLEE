"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer an equal 50/50 split which gives us each $500000. This seems most fair to both of us. I'm also not affected by inflation in this game, so I can be patient about reaching a fair agreement. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
