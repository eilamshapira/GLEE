"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money with me taking $600000 and you getting $400000. It's a fair start considering the potential for inflation affecting our shares in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. 

While an equal 50/50 split might seem fairest, Alice is making the first move, and I need to weigh the risks of rejecting. If I reject, we move to another round where I can make a counter-offer, but there's a time pressure with just 12 rounds total.

Alice mentioned inflation, but the instructions state that inflation is 0% for me, so the money's value won't decrease for me across rounds. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Given that I don't lose value from waiting and can make the next offer if I reject, I'll try for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer an equal 50/50 split which gives us each $500,000. This seems most fair to both of us. I'm also not affected by inflation in this game, so I can be patient about reaching a fair agreement. I hope this works for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a bit closer to an equal split while acknowledging the time pressure on my side. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has improved her offer from the initial 60/40 split to a 55/45 split, now offering me $450,000. She's also revealed that inflation is affecting her share - it's now worth 36% less to her than in the first round.

This is important information. While my money doesn't lose value over time, Alice is facing significant depreciation of her share with each passing round. This explains why she's eager to reach an agreement sooner.

Given this new information, her offer of $450,000 to me is more reasonable. However, since I know inflation is affecting her but not me, I have some leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round. On the other hand, if we keep rejecting offers, we risk not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds, which would leave us both with nothing.

I'll accept this improved offer to ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount.
