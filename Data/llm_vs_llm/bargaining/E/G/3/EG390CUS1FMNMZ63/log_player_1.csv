"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because:
1. It's a fair starting point that gives me a slight advantage
2. Bob should consider accepting since waiting will cost him more in value
3. It's a clean 60-40 split that's easy to understand"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. In round 1, I offered myself 6000 and Bob 4000
2. Now Bob offers me 4800, which due to 10% inflation is actually worth 4320 to me
3. Bob's offer to himself of 5200 is worth 4160 to him due to 20% inflation
4. If I reject, we go to round 3 where values will decrease further
5. I could try to get a better deal, but the risk of further value loss is significant

Given that the difference between my original offer and this one isn't huge after accounting for inflation, and that further negotiation will only reduce the total value for both of us, I'll accept.
