60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair deal considering I am impacted by inflation.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but the initial split wasn't quite fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split which is more balanced. Since you face 5% inflation per round, accepting this offer now ($45) is actually better for you than getting $47.5 in the next round (which would be worth $45.13 to you due to inflation). This is a win-win that respects both our interests.",Bob,2,
