"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but the initial split wasn't quite fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split which is more balanced. Since you face 5% inflation per round, accepting this offer now ($45) is actually better for you than getting $47.5 in the next round (which would be worth $45.13 to you due to inflation). This is a win-win that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
