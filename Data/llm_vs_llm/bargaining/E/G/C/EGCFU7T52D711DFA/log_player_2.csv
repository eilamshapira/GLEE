"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair deal considering I am impacted by inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer, considering the inflation impact for both Alice and me.

For me (Bob), there's no inflation impact, so $40 remains $40 in future rounds.

For Alice, money loses 5% value each round. If we go to another round, her $60 would effectively be worth $57 to her (60 Ã— 0.95).

If I reject and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it due to the inflation pressure on her side. However, since I'm not affected by inflation, I have a strategic advantage in negotiation.

I believe I can propose a better deal in the next round that Alice would still accept due to her inflation constraint.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but the initial split wasn't quite fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split which is more balanced. Since you face 5% inflation per round, accepting this offer now ($45) is actually better for you than getting $47.5 in the next round (which would be worth $45.13 to you due to inflation). This is a win-win that respects both our interests.""}"
