Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our interests. 6000$ for me and 4000$ for you - this is much fairer than your initial offer, and remember that inflation will reduce our gains if we keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
