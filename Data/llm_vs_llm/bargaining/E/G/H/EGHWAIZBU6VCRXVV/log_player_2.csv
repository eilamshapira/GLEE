"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and end this quickly. This offer is a win-win situation! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

- Alice is offering me only 1000$ out of 10,000$ (10%), while keeping 9000$ (90%) for herself
- This is far from a fair split
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- Due to inflation, my money will be worth 5% less next round, and Alice's will be worth 10% less
- Even with inflation, I should be able to propose a much better split for myself next round

No, this offer is too unfair. I should reject and make a more balanced proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer...

- The money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
- I should propose a more equitable split, but use the inflation pressure to my advantage
- A 60-40 split in my favor would be reasonable given the circumstances

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our interests. 6000$ for me and 4000$ for you - this is much fairer than your initial offer, and remember that inflation will reduce our gains if we keep negotiating.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a genuinely even split this time. I'm willing to compromise for a fair outcome, and this offer reflects that. Let's finalize this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer...

- Alice is now proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- Due to inflation, my $5000 is worth effectively $4,512.50 (9.75% less)
- For Alice, her $5000 is worth effectively $4,050 (19% less)
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but:
  - My money will be worth even less (14.75% less next round)
  - Alice's money will be worth 29% less next round
- This is a fair split, and further negotiation will only decrease the value for both of us
- This is significantly better than her first offer

Yes, this is a reasonable offer that I should accept before inflation erodes more value.
