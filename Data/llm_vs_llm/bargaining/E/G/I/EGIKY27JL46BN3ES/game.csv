550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split that acknowledges the difference in our inflation rates. With your 5% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're in a better position to wait. This 55/45 split compensates for that advantage while still being very generous to you.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the difference in our inflation rates. This offer still gives you a significant portion, but it acknowledges the faster depreciation of your money.",Bob,2,

510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer to find a fair middle ground. Given that we've already lost value due to inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This 51/49 split is very reasonable considering we both face inflation, even if at different rates. Let's finalize this deal and not lose more value.",Alice,3,
