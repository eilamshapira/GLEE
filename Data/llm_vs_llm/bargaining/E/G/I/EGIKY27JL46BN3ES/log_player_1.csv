"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split that acknowledges the difference in our inflation rates. With your 5% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're in a better position to wait. This 55/45 split compensates for that advantage while still being very generous to you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the difference in our inflation rates. This offer still gives you a significant portion, but it acknowledges the faster depreciation of your money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a revised offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer to find a fair middle ground. Given that we've already lost value due to inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This 51/49 split is very reasonable considering we both face inflation, even if at different rates. Let's finalize this deal and not lose more value.""
