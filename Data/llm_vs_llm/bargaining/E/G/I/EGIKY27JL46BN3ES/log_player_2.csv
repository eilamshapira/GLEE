"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split that acknowledges the difference in our inflation rates. With your 5% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're in a better position to wait. This 55/45 split compensates for that advantage while still being very generous to you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the difference in our inflation rates. This offer still gives you a significant portion, but it acknowledges the faster depreciation of your money.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer to find a fair middle ground. Given that we've already lost value due to inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This 51/49 split is very reasonable considering we both face inflation, even if at different rates. Let's finalize this deal and not lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
