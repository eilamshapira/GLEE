Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because it was quite unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced split that's better for both of us. Let's not waste time and value due to inflation - this is a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
