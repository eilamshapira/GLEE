"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'll take 6000 and you get 4000. This is a good deal for both of us, so let's finish this quick! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 4000$ for me and 6000$ for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - I can make my own proposal
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me (so 10,000$ becomes worth 9,000$ to me)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice

The current offer gives me 4000$, while a 50-50 split would be 5000$ each. Alice's offer is significantly lower than an equal split, and since it's only round 1, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal, even accounting for the 10% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that Alice made an aggressive first offer, I'll still maintain a slight advantage for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I rejected your offer because it was quite unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced split that's better for both of us. Let's not waste time and value due to inflation - this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I understand your perspective. Inflation is hitting us, so I'm adjusting my offer. I'll take 5500 and you get 4500. Let's get this done before the money loses more value! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: 4500$ for me, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth 3645$ in round 1 terms
2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can propose again
   - Money will be worth 29% less for me
   - Money will be worth about 13% less for Alice
   - A 10,000$ pot would be worth 7100$ to me in round 4

Interestingly, Alice is experiencing less inflation than I am (9.75% vs 19%). This means delays hurt me more than they hurt her. While I might want a better split, the increasing inflation rate on my side makes waiting costly.

Given that:
1. Further delays will hurt me more than Alice
2. Alice has shown some willingness to compromise from her initial offer
3. The real value I'm getting (3645$) is still substantial
