"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that I believe is fair and reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives us each $5,000. This is an equal division that respects both of our interests and avoids the risk of inflation reducing the total value in subsequent rounds."
