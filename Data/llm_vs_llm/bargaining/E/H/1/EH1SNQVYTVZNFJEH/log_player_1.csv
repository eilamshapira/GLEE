"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share ($5000 each), and we can conclude the deal quickly without risking further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I reject and try to negotiate in the next round, my share will be worth 10% less
2. A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable
3. Continuing negotiations risks both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds
4. Even though I initially asked for more (60-40), this is a good compromise that avoids the risk of further value loss through inflation"
