"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, which is 40%. 

While this isn't exactly an equal split, there are several factors to consider:
1. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer
2. I know my money doesn't lose value over rounds, so I'm not pressured by inflation
3. However, we only have 12 rounds total, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing
4. A 40% share is still a substantial amount ($4000)

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, there's a risk of prolonging negotiations unnecessarily when I'm already being offered a decent amount. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I could make a counter-offer, but I should also consider that a 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll try to negotiate for a better split in my counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share ($5000 each), and we can conclude the deal quickly without risking further rounds of negotiation.""
