0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, given the structure of the game and the 5% depreciation I face in every subsequent round, my best‐move proposal is to award you the full $10000 right now. I know it might seem a bit one‐sided, but since your future proposals aren’t discounted, waiting only improves your position. I’d appreciate your acceptance of this offer so we can both avoid any further time loss.",Alice,1,
