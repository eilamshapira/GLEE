"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the structure of the game and the 5% depreciation I face in every subsequent round, my best‐move proposal is to award you the full $10000 right now. I know it might seem a bit one‐sided, but since your future proposals aren’t discounted, waiting only improves your position. I’d appreciate your acceptance of this offer so we can both avoid any further time loss. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically...

1. Alice is offering me the entire $10,000, which is the maximum I could possibly get.
2. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, there's literally no way to improve my position from here.
3. Alice is correct about the game dynamics - she faces 5% depreciation per round while I don't.
4. Even if I wanted to be generous and offer Alice some money in the next round, it would be worth less to her than it is now.
5. This is actually a perfectly rational offer from Alice given the game structure.
