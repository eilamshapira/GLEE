"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face with each round. Since this is the first round, I should make a fair but strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the $100. This is fair and gives us both the same amount. Since I face 20% inflation with each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly."
