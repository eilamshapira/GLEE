Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round might reduce the value of your share—even if I don't face inflation, you might. To avoid any risk of devaluation on your side, I'm proposing $20 for you now, with $80 for me. Let's settle this quickly rather than risk further losses for you. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The potential loss from inflation (5%) is much smaller than accepting such an unfair split. Even with 5% inflation, getting a larger share in the next round would be more beneficial than accepting $20 now. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I've reduced my requested share to show flexibility. This 55-45 split is fair and reasonable. If we continue negotiating, inflation will hurt my share further, but an extremely unfair split like your last offer isn't acceptable. Let's agree and end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, each additional round only deepens the impact on your share. By accepting my offer now—where I receive $55 and you receive $45—you lock in your position before further erosion takes effect. Though my proposal gives you a lower nominal amount than your previous offer, the effective value you’d secure is higher than what a protracted negotiation would yield. Let's settle this now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob has moved significantly from his initial unfair offer of $20, and is now offering a relatively fair split. With inflation already at 14.26% and potentially growing further if negotiations continue, accepting $45 now is reasonable. While I might be able to negotiate for a slightly better nominal amount, the risk of further devaluation and the fact that Bob has shown willingness to compromise makes this a acceptable offer."
