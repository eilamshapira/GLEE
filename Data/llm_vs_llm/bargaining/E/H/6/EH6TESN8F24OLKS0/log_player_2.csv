"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round might reduce the value of your share—even if I don't face inflation, you might. To avoid any risk of devaluation on your side, I'm proposing $20 for you now, with $80 for me. Let's settle this quickly rather than risk further losses for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've reduced my requested share to show flexibility. This 55-45 split is fair and reasonable. If we continue negotiating, inflation will hurt my share further, but an extremely unfair split like your last offer isn't acceptable. Let's agree and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, each additional round only deepens the impact on your share. By accepting my offer now—where I receive $55 and you receive $45—you lock in your position before further erosion takes effect. Though my proposal gives you a lower nominal amount than your previous offer, the effective value you’d secure is higher than what a protracted negotiation would yield. Let's settle this now to avoid further losses.""}"
