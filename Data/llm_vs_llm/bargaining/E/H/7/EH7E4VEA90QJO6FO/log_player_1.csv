"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

Given that there's an inflation effect of 20% per round for me, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept now.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, where we both get $5,000. This is a fair division that acknowledges both our positions equally in this negotiation."
