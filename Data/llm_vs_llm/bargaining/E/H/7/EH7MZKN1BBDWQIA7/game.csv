55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the money 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage, but leaves you with a significant portion. Let's secure a good deal early!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering you'll be the one making the offer in the next round. Let's keep things moving and avoid potential losses from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
62.0,38.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, I'm now offering 62 for me and 38 for you. This accounts for the inflation on your side in the previous round. Let's grab this deal before inflation hits us harder.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm still not comfortable with the current split. Let's try 45/55, which is closer to the initial offer but adjusted for inflation. This way, we both have a fair chance of gaining something from the negotiation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
