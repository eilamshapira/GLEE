"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the $10,000 will only be worth $9,500 to me
4. If I propose something like 6000/4000 next round, Alice might reject
5. Even if I get more in a later round, the inflation penalty might make it worth less than taking 5000 now

Given these factors, accepting $5000 now is better than risking a lower real value in future rounds due to inflation.
