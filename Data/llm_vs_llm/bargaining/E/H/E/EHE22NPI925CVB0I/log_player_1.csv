"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that inflation affects my gains by 5% per round, I want to propose a fair division that considers this asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion while keeping slightly more for myself to offset the inflation pressure I face in future rounds. This division gives Bob nearly half the money while recognizing the disadvantage I face if negotiations extend to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
