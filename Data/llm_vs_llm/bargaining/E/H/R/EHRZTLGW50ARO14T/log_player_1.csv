Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split to minimize losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

My 4500 is now worth 4050 due to 10% inflation from round 1.
If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less.

Bob's offer gives me 4050 (after inflation), which is less than what I originally proposed (6000), but if I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round due to continuing inflation.
