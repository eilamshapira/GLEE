"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the initial proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself as the first mover."
