"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, your offer wasn't optimal for me. This equal division gives us both significant value without further delays. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
