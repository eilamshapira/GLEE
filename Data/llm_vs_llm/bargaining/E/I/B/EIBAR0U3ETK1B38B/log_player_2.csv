"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer that gives us both a significant amount. Let's take it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 60/40 split favoring her.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects my share. That means the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000 immediately.
If I reject and try for a better deal next round, I'd need to secure more than $421,053 (which is equivalent to $400,000 now after accounting for 5% inflation) to make waiting worthwhile.

Since I can propose next round and Alice doesn't necessarily face the same inflation penalty, I think I can secure a better deal by making my own proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being fair to Alice.
