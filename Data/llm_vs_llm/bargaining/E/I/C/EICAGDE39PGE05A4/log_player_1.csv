"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since inflation affects me at 10% vs your 5%, a more equitable split would be 45/55. This is fair and we both avoid value loss from further delays. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, a 55/45 split in my favor seems fair.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
