"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 60/40 split gives me $400,000, I should consider that inflation affects me more strongly than Alice (10% vs 5% per round). If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but my purchasing power will decrease faster than hers in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that recognizes both the inflation differential and preserves more value for both of us than prolonged negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, since inflation affects me at 10% vs your 5%, a more equitable split would be 45/55. This is fair and we both avoid value loss from further delays.""}"
