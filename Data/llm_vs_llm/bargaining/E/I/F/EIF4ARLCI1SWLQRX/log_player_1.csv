"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair split giving me a slight advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000
2. The money is worth the same to me as in round 1
3. For Bob, his $550,000 is actually worth only $440,000 (20% less) due to inflation
4. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further

Since I can get $450,000 now, which is still a substantial amount, and Bob is actually getting less value than me due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
