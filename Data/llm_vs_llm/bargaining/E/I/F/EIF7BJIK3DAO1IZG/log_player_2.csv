"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I think this is a fair split. I'll give you $40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 in the next round would only be worth $38 to me

While $40 isn't an even split, rejecting might put me in a worse position due to inflation. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
