"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation, I think a slightly larger share for me is fair. Let's settle this quickly.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's reach a compromise. I'll take 475k and you'll get 525k. It's a fair adjustment considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than what I proposed last round, and with inflation eating into the pot, it's best to settle now and secure a reasonable amount."
