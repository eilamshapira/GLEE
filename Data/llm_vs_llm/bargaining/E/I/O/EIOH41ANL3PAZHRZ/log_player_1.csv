Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 714286, ""bob_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my offer based on our discount factors. I propose to take $714,286 and you get $285,714. Accepting now secures you $285,714 in full value; delaying into round 2 means your share would drop by 20% per round. I believe this offer fairly reflects our future options. What do you say?""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your logic, but I believe a more equitable split is in order.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in your favor, acknowledging the discount factors while aiming for a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
