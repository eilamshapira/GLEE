"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my offer based on our discount factors. I propose to take $714286 and you get $285714. Accepting now secures you $285714 in full value; delaying into round 2 means your share would drop by 20% per round. I believe this offer fairly reflects our future options. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 285714 
# Alice gain: 714286
