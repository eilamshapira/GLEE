55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 10% each round, so I'm incentivized to settle quickly. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with nothing.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, given that every round delay reduces your payout by 10%, I propose we settle now. I offer 40 for you and 60 for meâ€”this way, you avoid further loss in value. I believe this deal is in both our interests; please consider accepting it.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's not quite fair. Let's split this exactly 50/50, which is the fairest solution. With inflation affecting me each round, I'm motivated to settle quickly, but I also need a reasonable share. This is a perfectly balanced offer that benefits us both equally. Please accept so we can both walk away satisfied.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand your pursuit of fairness, but please consider that every round the inflation works against your share. In round 3, your portion was already effectively reduced by 19% compared to its initial full value, and waiting another round would only worsen that outcome. To avoid further losses, I propose a division where I receive $65 and you receive $35. This offer gives you a better outcome than the potential diminishing returns of future rounds. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit.",Bob,4,

48.0,52.0,"Bob, I see you're attempting to leverage inflation against me, but I'm still willing to find middle ground. I'm offering you the majority at $52 while I take $48. This is more than fair considering a 50/50 split would be the standard in most negotiations. With inflation already reducing my effective gain, this is a reasonable compromise. If we continue, we both risk losing everything after 12 rounds. Please accept this fair offer so we can both benefit.",Alice,5,
