"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 10% each round, so I'm incentivized to settle quickly. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, given that every round delay reduces your payout by 10%, I propose we settle now. I offer 40 for you and 60 for meâ€”this way, you avoid further loss in value. I believe this deal is in both our interests; please consider accepting it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's not quite fair. Let's split this exactly 50/50, which is the fairest solution. With inflation affecting me each round, I'm motivated to settle quickly, but I also need a reasonable share. This is a perfectly balanced offer that benefits us both equally. Please accept so we can both walk away satisfied.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your pursuit of fairness, but please consider that every round the inflation works against your share. In round 3, your portion was already effectively reduced by 19% compared to its initial full value, and waiting another round would only worsen that outcome. To avoid further losses, I propose a division where I receive $65 and you receive $35. This offer gives you a better outcome than the potential diminishing returns of future rounds. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Bob, I see you're attempting to leverage inflation against me, but I'm still willing to find middle ground. I'm offering you the majority at $52 while I take $48. This is more than fair considering a 50/50 split would be the standard in most negotiations. With inflation already reducing my effective gain, this is a reasonable compromise. If we continue, we both risk losing everything after 12 rounds. Please accept this fair offer so we can both benefit.""}"
