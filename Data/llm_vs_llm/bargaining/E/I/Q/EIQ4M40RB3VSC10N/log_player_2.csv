"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 10% each round, so I'm incentivized to settle quickly. If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, given that every round delay reduces your payout by 10%, I propose we settle now. I offer 40 for you and 60 for meâ€”this way, you avoid further loss in value. I believe this deal is in both our interests; please consider accepting it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's not quite fair. Let's split this exactly 50/50, which is the fairest solution. With inflation affecting me each round, I'm motivated to settle quickly, but I also need a reasonable share. This is a perfectly balanced offer that benefits us both equally. Please accept so we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your pursuit of fairness, but please consider that every round the inflation works against your share. In round 3, your portion was already effectively reduced by 19% compared to its initial full value, and waiting another round would only worsen that outcome. To avoid further losses, I propose a division where I receive $65 and you receive $35. This offer gives you a better outcome than the potential diminishing returns of future rounds. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're attempting to leverage inflation against me, but I'm still willing to find middle ground. I'm offering you the majority at $52 while I take $48. This is more than fair considering a 50/50 split would be the standard in most negotiations. With inflation already reducing my effective gain, this is a reasonable compromise. If we continue, we both risk losing everything after 12 rounds. Please accept this fair offer so we can both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
