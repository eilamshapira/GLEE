"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth less now, and considering your previous offer, I propose a slightly adjusted split. Take it or leave it, the money's losing value. 
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $6400, which is actually better than what I proposed ($6000)
2. Bob is taking less ($3600) than what I offered him ($4000)
3. While the money is worth 10% less for Bob, this doesn't affect my portion
4. If I reject, we go to another round, and Bob's portion will be worth even less
5. This is a very favorable offer for me - I get more than I initially proposed
