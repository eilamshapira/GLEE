I'm going for a big share, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is not great, I'm going to reject it. The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, so I need to try to get a better deal. I think I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference. I'm aware of the inflation, so I'm offering a more balanced split compared to my initial offer, hoping Bob will accept."
