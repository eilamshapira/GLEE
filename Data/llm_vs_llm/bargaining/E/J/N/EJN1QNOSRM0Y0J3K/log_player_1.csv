"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600.

Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in round 2, which is 10% * 2 = 20% less than the original value. So, the money I gain is worth 0.8 times its original value.

The money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in round 2, which is 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% in round 1 + 20% in round 2, but compounded: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). However, for simplicity, we calculate it as 20% less in each round: 0.8 in round 1 and 0.8 in round 2, so 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
