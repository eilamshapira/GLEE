I propose a 90/10 split. It's a good starting point, and hopefully Bob will be reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to try a 70/30 split. While Bob rejected my previous offer, he may be more willing to compromise now that it's his turn to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm getting much less than I initially hoped for, I'm losing a lot of money with each round.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less."
