"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, money will be worth 20% less in the next round
4. This means her $900,000 would only be worth $720,000 to her in the next round
5. This gives me negotiating leverage - I can offer her a deal that gives her more nominal dollars but is actually worth less to her
6. Given this dynamic, I should reject this clearly unfair initial offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice faces a 20% discount per round, I can use this to make a strategic offer:

In the next round (round 3), any amount would be worth 20% less to Alice. So if I offer her a fair amount now, it would be more attractive than waiting, even if she could get more nominal dollars later.

I'll propose a more equitable split, but still taking advantage of my stronger negotiating position:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's much better for Alice than my potential future offers could be (since her $400,000 now is worth more than $500,000 in the next round)
2. It's fair enough that she should seriously consider accepting
3. If she rejects, I can still negotiate, but she'll be in a weaker position due to the time discount"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000 and keeping $700,000
2. For Alice, due to 36% inflation, her $700,000 is actually only worth $448,000 to her
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - Alice will face 48.8% inflation (1 - 0.8^3)
   - I can make another offer
   - Her money will be worth even less to her
4. Given this weakening position for Alice, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting

The offer is better than her first one, but given Alice's deteriorating position due to inflation, I should reject and make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:

1. Alice now faces 48.8% inflation (1 - 0.8^3)
2. If she rejects this offer, in the next round she'll face about 59% inflation
3. She's shown she's willing to negotiate but still wants a significant portion
4. I need to make an offer that's better for her to take now than risk further inflation

I'll make this offer:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This is strategic because:
1. For Alice, $300,000 now (worth about $153,600 after her 48.8% inflation) is better than a larger nominal amount in the next round
2. It's a significant improvement in my position
3. If she rejects, her negotiating position will be even weaker in the next round
4. It's enough money that it should still be worth her while to accept"
