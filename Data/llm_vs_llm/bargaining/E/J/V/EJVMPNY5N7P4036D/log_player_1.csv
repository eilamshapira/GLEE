"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I'm Alice and I'm first to make an offer, I need to consider the time pressure and different inflation rates affecting Bob and me.

My offer for Round 1:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while recognizing that I'm the first mover in this negotiation."
