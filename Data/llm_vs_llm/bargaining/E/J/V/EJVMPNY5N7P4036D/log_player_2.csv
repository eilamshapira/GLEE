"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to her. That means my bargaining power decreases faster than hers with each round.

Given that:
1. It's a decent offer (45% of the total)
2. My inflation rate (20%) is worse than hers (10%)
3. We only have 12 rounds total
4. There's risk in prolonging negotiations

I will accept this offer.
