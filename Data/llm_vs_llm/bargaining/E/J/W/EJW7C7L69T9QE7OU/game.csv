5000.0,5000.0,How about an even split this time? 50-50 seems fair given the inflation.,Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for you, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This round, my gain is worth 27% less than in round 1, while yours is worth 49% less. Let's agree soon to preserve more of our money's value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's try a different approach. I propose a 40-60 split, where I take 40% and you take 60%. It's still beneficial for both of us considering the inflation.",Alice,5,
