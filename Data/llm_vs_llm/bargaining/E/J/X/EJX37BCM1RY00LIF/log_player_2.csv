"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60.

If I reject and make a counteroffer next round, I need to remember that due to inflation, each dollar will be worth 20% less to me. So if we wait another round, the total value to me would be reduced.

Since this is the first round and I'd get 40% of the total sum, which is a substantial amount, and waiting would decrease the value of any future offer for me due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
