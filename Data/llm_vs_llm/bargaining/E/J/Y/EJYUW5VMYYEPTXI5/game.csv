50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split: $50 each. Given the inflation factor diminishing the value for me as rounds pass, I believe this fair division secures our gains while avoiding further losses. Let me know your thoughts!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm proposing I get $60 and you get $40. Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's settle this round.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but receiving $40 this round means I’d effectively get only about $38 when adjusted for the 5% inflation for me. I believe that by taking the next round and making my own proposal, I can secure a fairer arrangement for both of us. So I must reject this round’s proposal.",Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1, I'd like to propose we settle now. I’m offering $45 for myself and $55 for you. This way, you secure a slightly higher share without risking further complications or additional inflation hit on my end in later rounds. Let’s finalize this round and move on rather than both incur further losses.",Alice,3,
