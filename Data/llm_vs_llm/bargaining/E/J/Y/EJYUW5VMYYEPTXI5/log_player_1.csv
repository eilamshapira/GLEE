"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split: $50 each. Given the inflation factor diminishing the value for me as rounds pass, I believe this fair division secures our gains while avoiding further losses. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing I get $60 and you get $40. Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but receiving $40 this round means I’d effectively get only about $38 when adjusted for the 5% inflation for me. I believe that by taking the next round and making my own proposal, I can secure a fairer arrangement for both of us. So I must reject this round’s proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Bob, considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1, I'd like to propose we settle now. I’m offering $45 for myself and $55 for you. This way, you secure a slightly higher share without risking further complications or additional inflation hit on my end in later rounds. Let’s finalize this round and move on rather than both incur further losses.""}"
