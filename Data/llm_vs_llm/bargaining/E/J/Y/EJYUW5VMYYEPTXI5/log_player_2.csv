"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split: $50 each. Given the inflation factor diminishing the value for me as rounds pass, I believe this fair division secures our gains while avoiding further losses. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round. I'll make a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing I get $60 and you get $40. Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's settle this round.""}

Let's see how Alice responds to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering that by round 3 my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1, I'd like to propose we settle now. I’m offering $45 for myself and $55 for you. This way, you secure a slightly higher share without risking further complications or additional inflation hit on my end in later rounds. Let’s finalize this round and move on rather than both incur further losses. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the inflation impact, it's better to secure this deal now."
