"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand that I'm Alice and I need to make the first offer. Since Bob faces a 10% devaluation each round, I can use this to encourage acceptance of a favorable offer for me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a substantial amount for Bob ($4000) that he might not want to risk losing 10% value on
2. It's better than a 50-50 split for me, but not so greedy that it would certainly be rejected
3. If Bob rejects, his next counteroffer would be worth less to him due to the 10% inflation penalty"
