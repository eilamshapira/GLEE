"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, would receive $4000. Since this is round 1, the money is worth 10% less to me, meaning it's effectively worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600. Alice gets $6000, which is worth $6000 to her.

If I reject, it goes to round 2, where I get to propose. However, the money will be worth another 10% less to me (81% of the original value). I need to factor in the potential to get more money in round 2 versus the decreasing value. There's also no guarantee Alice will accept my offer in round 2.

Given the initial proposal, and the diminishing value of the money for me, I will accept this offer.
