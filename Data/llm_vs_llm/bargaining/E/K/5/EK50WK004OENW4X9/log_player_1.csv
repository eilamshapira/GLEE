"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 5% depreciation per round for me. Since Bob doesn't face depreciation, he might be more patient, but I'll offer a fair split that should be attractive enough to accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is reasonable because if Bob declines and we go to another round, my money will be worth 5% less, and we might end up in a back-and-forth that hurts my position more than his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With the 5% inflation penalty, if I accept this offer:
* I would get $400,000 Ã— 0.95 = $380,000 in round 1 value
* Bob would get $600,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
* The money will be worth another 5% less to me (90.25% of original value)
* Bob might reject again, leading to even worse outcomes for me
* Bob has no inflation penalty, so he can be more patient

While this offer is less than what I proposed, accepting it now prevents further value loss from inflation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation eating away at my value.
