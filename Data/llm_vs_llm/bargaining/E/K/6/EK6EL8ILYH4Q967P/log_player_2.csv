"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 20% less for me if I wait, so $5000 now is better than $6000 in the next round
4. There's also a risk Alice might offer less in future rounds
5. 50-50 is a common fair split in these types of games

Given all these factors, especially the inflation penalty, I think this is a reasonable offer to accept.
