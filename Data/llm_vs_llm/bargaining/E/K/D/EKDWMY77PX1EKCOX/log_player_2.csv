"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. While this is fair in absolute terms, I need to remember that inflation reduces the value of my money by 10% each round if I reject. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value would only be worth $9,000 to me, so even if I got more than $5,000, the actual value might be less than accepting $5,000 now.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and inflation affects me significantly, an even split in the first round is actually quite reasonable.
