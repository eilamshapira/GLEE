"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation effect of 10% per round, I need to make a reasonable initial offer that Bob is likely to accept in the first round. If we continue to the next round, the total value to me will be less, though I don't know how inflation impacts Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion, Bob, while also acknowledging that I'm affected by inflation in future rounds, which incentivizes me to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is taking a significantly larger share despite facing steeper inflation than I do. I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I know Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I face 10%, I can make a more informed offer. Since we're now in round 3, my gains are worth 20% less than the original value, and Bob's would be worth 40% less. I should propose something that acknowledges this asymmetry while being fair enough that Bob will accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair and should be attractive to Bob given that they face higher inflation than I do (20% per round versus my 10%). If we continue to further rounds, both of us lose more value, but Bob loses at a faster rate than I do."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because Bob is still asking for a very large share despite facing much steeper inflation than I do. Since Bob's money loses value at twice my rate, continuing to the next round impacts them more than me, which gives me some leverage to negotiate a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob has consistently pursued a larger share despite facing higher inflation penalties, I need to make a strategic offer that considers our respective positions. At this point, my gains are worth about 34.4% less than in round 1, while Bob's are worth about 59% less.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob a slight majority of the money (55%) while keeping 45% for myself. This is more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, acknowledging that we need to reach an agreement. However, it's still reasonable given that Bob faces much steeper inflation penalties than I do. If we continue to further rounds, Bob will lose value at a faster rate than me, so there's a strong incentive for both of us to conclude this negotiation now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though we're both facing significant inflation penalties (my money is worth about 41% less and Bob's is worth about 67% less than in round 1), Bob is still demanding a very large share (70%). Given that Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine, continuing to negotiate actually works more in my favor as Bob's potential gains lose value faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point, we're both losing significant value through inflation. My gains would now be worth about 46.9% less than in round 1, while Bob's are worth about 73.8% less. Bob seems committed to getting a large share despite facing much steeper inflation, but I need to find a compromise that can end this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm now offering Bob a 60-40 split in their favor. This represents a substantial concession from my earlier positions, acknowledging that we need to reach an agreement. Bob's inflation rate is significantly higher than mine, so continuing this negotiation further would disproportionately hurt their potential gains. This offer allows Bob to maintain a clear majority of the funds while still providing me with a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I've decided to accept Bob's offer. At this point, inflation has significantly reduced the value for both of us, with my gains worth about 52% less than in round 1 and Bob's worth about 79% less. While the 250,000/750,000 split heavily favors Bob in nominal terms, when accounting for inflation, it's better for me to accept now than to continue negotiating and lose more value. The actual value I'm receiving is still meaningful, whereas continuing to another round would further erode both our shares."
