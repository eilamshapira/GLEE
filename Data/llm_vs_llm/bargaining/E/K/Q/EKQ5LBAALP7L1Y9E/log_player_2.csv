"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me
   * The money will be worth 10% less for Alice
3. This means if I wait, Alice will be more motivated to accept a different split since her money devalues faster

Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine, I can probably get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. The current 40/60 split is not favorable enough to accept immediately.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), and she knows this, I should be able to propose a more favorable split. However, I shouldn't be too greedy as she might reject and the total value will decrease for both of us.

A fair split considering the devaluation rates would be slightly in my favor, as Alice has more incentive to agree quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's better than the previous 40/60 split
2. If Alice rejects, her next-round value will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less
3. It's not so extreme that it would trigger an automatic rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $45 is actually worth $40.61 (45 * 0.9025)
   * Alice's $55 is worth $44.55 (55 * 0.81)
3. If I reject and go to next round:
   * Money will devalue another 5% for me (total 14.75% from original)
   * Money will devalue another 10% for Alice (total 29% from original)
   * This significant devaluation makes waiting less attractive

Given that:
- This offer is better than the first offer ($45 vs $40)
- Further delays will significantly reduce the real value for both of us
- The split is relatively fair considering the circumstances
- Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but not accept a dramatic shift in her favor
