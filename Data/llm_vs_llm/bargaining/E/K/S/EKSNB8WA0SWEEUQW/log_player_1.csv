"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a significant 40% share upfront. This is generous and hopefully will incentivize him to accept the deal quickly, as the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation. I'm aiming for a balance between securing a good portion for myself and making it attractive enough for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1, and Bob's money is worth 10% less than in Round 1.

Let's think strategically. While Bob is getting the larger share, the money is worth less to him now than it was in Round 1. I need to decide if accepting $45 now, with a 5% devaluation, is better than risking further rounds with unknown proposals and increasing devaluation.

Given that I started at 60 and Bob's rejected, I think he's likely to be greedy. It's still early in the game and I would rather continue negotiating and see what I can get out of Bob.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 3. Inflation is biting me now. My money is worth 10% less than at the start, I need to be mindful of that. Bob rejected my generous offer in round 1 and came back with a lowball offer in round 2. I'm thinking I'll try to meet him in the middle, but still keep the inflation in mind.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 53,
  ""bob_gain"": 47
}
```

Explanation:

* I'm going slightly above the midpoint to show a willingness to compromise, but still aiming to secure a decent portion for myself given the continued inflation penalty I'm facing. I am hoping Bob will find this offer tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's break down Bob's offer in round 4.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $48, Bob gets $52.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1, and Bob's money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1.

Bob is offering me slightly more than before, and the inflation is starting to hit him harder than me. If I keep waiting, I could end up with very little. I will accept the deal now.

""decision"": ""accept""
}
