52.0,48.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid delays and the inflation cost I incur with each round, I propose a split of $52 for me and $48 for you. I believe this division is fair and benefits both of us if we settle quickly. What do you say?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a slightly different split: $55 for me and $45 for you.  I feel this is more in line with a fair division. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, given the inflation and the timing of our negotiations, getting $45 for me in this round would reduce its value further. I believe we can both do better if we continue the negotiation. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
46.0,54.0,"Hi Bob, I know that with each round my share loses value due to inflation, and I’d really prefer we settle quickly. To avoid further losses on my end, I’m proposing a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. I believe this offer reflects the cost of delay while still giving you a strong share. Let’s settle now and avoid dragging this out—what do you think?",Alice,3,
