"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid delays and the inflation cost I incur with each round, I propose a split of $52 for me and $48 for you. I believe this division is fair and benefits both of us if we settle quickly. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a slightly different split: $55 for me and $45 for you.  I feel this is more in line with a fair division. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, given the inflation and the timing of our negotiations, getting $45 for me in this round would reduce its value further. I believe we can both do better if we continue the negotiation. Let's proceed to the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with each round my share loses value due to inflation, and I’d really prefer we settle quickly. To avoid further losses on my end, I’m proposing a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. I believe this offer reflects the cost of delay while still giving you a strong share. Let’s settle now and avoid dragging this out—what do you think?""}"
