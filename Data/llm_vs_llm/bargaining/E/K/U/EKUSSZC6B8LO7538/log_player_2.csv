Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid delays and the inflation cost I incur with each round, I propose a split of $52 for me and $48 for you. I believe this division is fair and benefits both of us if we settle quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with each round my share loses value due to inflation, and I’d really prefer we settle quickly. To avoid further losses on my end, I’m proposing a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. I believe this offer reflects the cost of delay while still giving you a strong share. Let’s settle now and avoid dragging this out—what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 54 
# Alice gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
