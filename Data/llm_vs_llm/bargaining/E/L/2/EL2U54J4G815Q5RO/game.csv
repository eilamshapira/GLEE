10000.0,0.0,"Hi Bob,

Time is money – literally. My offer today is that I keep the entire $10000. Since every delay reduces the value of the money for you by 10% (while my share remains unaffected), waiting would only harm your eventual payoff. Accepting now avoids further losses, so I encourage you to agree and let’s settle this immediately.",Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand that time impacts my share, but fairness does matter. Here's an offer where you get $5500 and I get $4500. This way, we both walk away with a significant sum, and I avoid further losses. Let's finalize this deal.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob,

I appreciate your effort toward fairness, but considering that my share does not depreciate with time while yours does, I can do even better by waiting until the next round when I get to propose. Therefore, I'm going to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob,

Given that with every round your share loses another 10% of its value, waiting further will only hurt your prospects. In round 3, if you reject this offer you'll eventually get to propose, but you'll be forced to hand almost the entire amount over to me in order for me to agree—leaving you with nearly nothing. That being the case, I am offering you $1 now (which is worth $0.80 in today’s terms) versus an effective payoff of almost zero later. I believe this is the most rational choice for both of us given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up today.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
7200.0,2800.0,"Hi Alice, I realize the value decay is affecting me significantly, but a fair distribution is important. I propose that you receive $7200, while I take $2800. This gives you a substantial gain and allows me a fair share amidst the devaluation. I hope this offer works for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob,

I appreciate the gesture and your aim for fairness, but I'm convinced that waiting another round will allow me to propose a division that better reflects the dynamics of our situation—with my share staying constant while your share continues to erode. In round 5, I'll have the opportunity to craft an offer that gives me a far larger portion of the $10000, and given the continuing depreciation of the funds you receive, it would be in your own long‐term interest to accept an offer that compensates you only minimally in nominal terms.

For these reasons, I must reject your current proposal.",Alice,4,reject
9900.0,100.0,"Hi Bob,

By round 5 the impact of inflation is severe on your end – your share is now worth only about 65.61% of its nominal value. If you reject this offer and push the game into another round, your effective payoff will drop even further. I’m offering you $100 (which translates to an effective value of about $65.61 in today's terms) immediately. While it may seem modest, accepting now is far better than risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds. I urge you to consider the steep depreciation and accept this proposal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the depreciation is affecting my share more with each round, but I believe a fair deal is still in reach. I propose a division where you receive $8500, and I take $1500. This offer still gives you a substantial majority while ensuring I get a reasonable share under the current conditions. I hope we can reach an agreement this time.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob,

I appreciate your effort to craft a fair offer given the depreciation you're facing. However, I believe that if we proceed to another round—with me proposing—I can secure an even more favorable division for myself without significantly improving your effective payoff. Your current proposal of $8500 for me and $1500 for you may look decent in nominal terms, but with your share devalued by over 40%, you’re still receiving far less in effective value compared to a scenario where you eventually accept a minimal amount. I’m confident that in the next round, by being the proposer, I can design an offer that ensures I get nearly the full $10000, reflecting the unchanged value of my money versus the continuously eroding value of yours. For these reasons, I must reject your offer and await my turn to propose in round 7.",Alice,6,reject
9980.0,20.0,"Hi Bob,

Every extra round means your share loses more of its value while mine stays the same. I know in round 6 you were aiming for $1500 for yourself, but if we continue, you’d be forced into proposals where even that number—when adjusted for depreciation—would vanish almost entirely. In this round, I’m making you a final, take‐it-or‐leave‐it offer. I keep $9980 and you get $20. While the nominal amount for you may seem extremely low, its effective value now is far better than what you’d end up with after another round of further devaluation. I urge you to consider that accepting $20 today is far superior to risking an even smaller payoff tomorrow.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the dynamics of the game heavily favor you as the rounds progress. At this point, I'm proposing a division where you receive $9000 and I take $1000. This still aligns with your significant share preference while acknowledging the depreciation impact on my end. I hope this represents a reasonable compromise and leads us to an agreement.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob,

I recognize your effort in proposing a division where I get $9000 and you get $1000. However, given that your money loses 52.17% of its value this round, and knowing that my money remains at full value, I can do even better by waiting my turn to propose in the next round. If I get to make an offer, I can secure nearly the full $10000 for myself while offering you only a nominal amount—which, even when depreciated further, would likely be less than the $1000 on the table now. For these reasons, I must reject your offer and look forward to proposing in Round 9.",Alice,8,reject
9970.0,30.0,"Hi Bob,

We’ve come a long way and the inflation has only worsened your position: with every additional round, your share’s value shrinks even further while mine stays intact. In this final proposal, I’m offering you $30. I know this might seem minimal, but if you reject this offer, waiting one more round will devalue your potential gain even more dramatically. Accepting $30 today secures you a better effective payoff than risking further depreciation. I hope you recognize the inevitability of this outcome and agree to settle now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
9500.0,500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the situation has significantly eroded my bargaining position. At this stage, I'm suggesting I take $500 and you receive $9500. This acknowledges the considerable advantage the rounds have given you, while allowing me to retain a meaningful amount. I hope this is acceptable for both of us and we can finally settle this.",Bob,10,
,,"Hi Bob,

I appreciate your offer, but it's not acceptable to me. My share holds its full value over the rounds, so by waiting just one more round I can secure nearly the entire $10000 while you would be forced to settle for an even more diminished amount. In round 11, as the proposer, I'll be able to craft a division that favors my interests even more. For this reason, I must reject your current proposal.",Alice,10,reject
9995.0,5.0,"Hi Bob,

This is my final proposal. With every additional round, the value you receive erodes even more dramatically while my share remains intact. Accepting this offer now means you'll receive $5, which is significantly better than the near‐nothing outcome you'd face if we continued. I urge you to consider that moving forward only deepens the loss on your end. Let's settle this deal immediately by accepting this division.",Alice,11,
