"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

Time is money – literally. My offer today is that I keep the entire $10000. Since every delay reduces the value of the money for you by 10% (while my share remains unaffected), waiting would only harm your eventual payoff. Accepting now avoids further losses, so I encourage you to agree and let’s settle this immediately.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

Given that with every round your share loses another 10% of its value, waiting further will only hurt your prospects. In round 3, if you reject this offer you'll eventually get to propose, but you'll be forced to hand almost the entire amount over to me in order for me to agree—leaving you with nearly nothing. That being the case, I am offering you $1 now (which is worth $0.80 in today’s terms) versus an effective payoff of almost zero later. I believe this is the most rational choice for both of us given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up today.

I propose that you receive $7,200, while I take $2,800. This gives you a substantial gain and allows me a fair share amidst the devaluation. I hope this offer works for both of us.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

By round 5 the impact of inflation is severe on your end – your share is now worth only about 65.61% of its nominal value. If you reject this offer and push the game into another round, your effective payoff will drop even further. I’m offering you $100 (which translates to an effective value of about $65.61 in today's terms) immediately. While it may seem modest, accepting now is far better than risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds. I urge you to consider the steep depreciation and accept this proposal.

I hope we can reach an agreement this time.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

Every extra round means your share loses more of its value while mine stays the same. I know in round 6 you were aiming for $1500 for yourself, but if we continue, you’d be forced into proposals where even that number—when adjusted for depreciation—would vanish almost entirely. In this round, I’m making you a final, take‐it-or‐leave‐it offer. I keep $9980 and you get $20. While the nominal amount for you may seem extremely low, its effective value now is far better than what you’d end up with after another round of further devaluation. I urge you to consider that accepting $20 today is far superior to risking an even smaller payoff tomorrow.

At this point, I'm proposing a division where you receive $9,000 and I take $1,000. This still aligns with your significant share preference while acknowledging the depreciation impact on my end. I hope this represents a reasonable compromise and leads us to an agreement.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

We’ve come a long way and the inflation has only worsened your position: with every additional round, your share’s value shrinks even further while mine stays intact. In this final proposal, I’m offering you $30. I know this might seem minimal, but if you reject this offer, waiting one more round will devalue your potential gain even more dramatically. Accepting $30 today secures you a better effective payoff than risking further depreciation. I hope you recognize the inevitability of this outcome and agree to settle now.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

This is my final proposal. With every additional round, the value you receive erodes even more dramatically while my share remains intact. Accepting this offer now means you'll receive $5, which is significantly better than the near‐nothing outcome you'd face if we continued. I urge you to consider that moving forward only deepens the loss on your end. Let's settle this deal immediately by accepting this division.
