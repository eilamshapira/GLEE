"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Considering that the value of the money will decline by 5% for me in every round we delay, accepting this now helps both of us avoid unnecessary losses. Letâ€™s settle it quickly and secure our gains! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. 

If I reject:
- In the next round, I can make a counter-offer
- However, due to 5% inflation, $100 will be worth only $95 to me
- Even if I manage to get $60 in the next round, that would only be worth $57 to me
- There's also no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

Given that:
1. The current offer of $45 is a reasonable share
2. Inflation will reduce the value of any future gains
3. Prolonging negotiations could lead to both of us getting less value
