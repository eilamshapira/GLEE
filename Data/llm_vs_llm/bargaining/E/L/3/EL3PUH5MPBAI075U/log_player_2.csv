"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $4,000 would effectively become worth $3,200 next round
5. This means I should only reject if I'm confident I can get significantly more than $5,000 next round to overcome the inflation penalty

A 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't exactly fair, but considering the inflation penalty, rejecting might put me in a worse position.
