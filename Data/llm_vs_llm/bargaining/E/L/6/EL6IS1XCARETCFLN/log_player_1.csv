Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for inflation. This is still a fair split considering the economic conditions. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob wants $5500 for himself and offers me $4500. While this is less than my initial 50-50 proposal, I need to consider:

1. The money's value hasn't changed for me due to inflation
2. If I reject, we go to the next round, where I can make another offer
3. However, further delays might lead to even more inflation affecting Bob's side
4. $4500 is still a substantial amount (45% of the total)
5. The difference from my initial proposal ($500) isn't worth the risk of further negotiation

Given these factors, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
