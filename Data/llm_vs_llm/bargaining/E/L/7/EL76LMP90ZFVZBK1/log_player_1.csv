"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion while accounting for the possibility of future rounds and inflation affecting my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that any money I receive is now worth 5% less than in round 1, and that further delays will continue to decrease the value, I'll analyze Bob's offer:

$50 with 5% inflation means I'd effectively get $47.50 in round 1 value.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, the next round will have another 5% inflation, and Bob might reject again.

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and the value will only decrease with time, I'll accept.
