344828.0,655172.0,"Dear Bob, I propose we settle now by splitting the million in a way that reflects our future bargaining positions. Given that if you wait you can propose in the next round—with money depreciating 10% for me and 5% for you today’s $1000000 is worth as if I’d get about 34.5% and you about 65.5% of it. Thus, my offer is that I take $344828 and you get $655172. Accepting now avoids further inflation losses for both of us.",Alice,1,
