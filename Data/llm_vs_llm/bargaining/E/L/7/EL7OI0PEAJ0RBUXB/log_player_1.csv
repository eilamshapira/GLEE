"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 344828, ""bob_gain"": 655172, ""message"": ""Dear Bob, I propose we settle now by splitting the million in a way that reflects our future bargaining positions. Given that if you wait you can propose in the next round—with money depreciating 10% for me and 5% for you today’s $1,000,000 is worth as if I’d get about 34.5% and you about 65.5% of it. Thus, my offer is that I take $344,828 and you get $655,172. Accepting now avoids further inflation losses for both of us.""}"
