"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide $100 between Bob and me.

Given that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a fair split that acknowledges this inflation difference.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair to both of us, and since Bob faces higher inflation in future rounds (20% vs my 5%), accepting this equal division now would be advantageous for him."
