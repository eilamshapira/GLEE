"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer and we go to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice
2. I'll get to make the next proposal
3. But Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further devaluation

The current offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair, but I could potentially get more in the next round. However, the significant 20% devaluation for me makes this risky.

$50 now is better than potentially getting $60 in the next round (which would only be worth $48 to me due to the 20% devaluation).
