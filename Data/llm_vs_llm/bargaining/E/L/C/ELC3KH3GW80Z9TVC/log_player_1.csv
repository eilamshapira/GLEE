"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50, which is generally considered fair, but gives me a small advantage. Since Bob can counter-offer if he refuses, this seems like a reasonable starting point that has a good chance of being accepted while still being advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $5000 is actually worth only $4000 to him (20% less)
3. My $5000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less in the next round
5. This offer is actually better for me than my initial proposal ($5200), and worse for Bob due to inflation
