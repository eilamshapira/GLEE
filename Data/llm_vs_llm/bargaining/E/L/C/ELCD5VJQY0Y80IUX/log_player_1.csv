"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a fair split, considering the inflation penalty. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $4600, but due to the 20% inflation penalty, its value to me is:
$4600 * 0.8 = $3680

Considering this, Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me. I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer wasn't satisfactory, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation penalties, I'll make a new offer.

For me, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and now another 20% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and now another 10% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself, while still being reasonable. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Now, let's evaluate Bob's new offer.

The original amount I would get is $4200, but due to the inflation penalty, its value to me is:
$4200 * (1 - 0.488) = $4200 * 0.512 = $2150.40

Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite unfavorable to me. However, I need to think about the alternative - rejecting the offer and potentially getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.

I'm not happy with this offer, but I should consider the risk of getting nothing. Still, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer wasn't satisfactory, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation penalties, I'll make a new offer.

For me, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and it will continue to decrease. I need to make a more reasonable offer to increase the chances of Bob accepting it.

I'll try to make a fairer offer, splitting the original amount closer to 50/50, while keeping in mind the inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
