"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For round 2, the value of the money for me is 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000, and for Alice, it's 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is 4200 * 0.81 (since it's 19% less than the original value) = $3402, and the actual value of the money Alice would gain is 5800 * 0.64 (since it's 36% less than the original value) = $3712.

Given this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money for me is now 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $7,291 (since it's 19% less than the original value after 3 rounds, or 10% less each round for 3 rounds), and for Alice, it's 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $5,120 (since it's 36% less than the original value after 3 rounds, or 20% less each round for 3 rounds, but we are at round 4 now so, 10% less for me and 20% less for alice for 3 rounds).

However, the correct way to calculate this is:
For me: 10,000 * (0.9)^3 = 10,000 * 0.729 = $7,290
For Alice: 10,000 * (0.8)^3 = 10,000 * 0.512 = $5,120

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is 5000 * 0.6561 (since 1 - 0.3439 = 0.6561, which is the percentage of the original value) = $3,280.50, and the actual value of the money Alice would gain is 5000 * 0.4096 (since 1 - 0.5904 = 0.4096, which is the percentage of the original value) = $2,048.

Given this, I think accepting this offer might be better than risking further inflation.
