"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a division where I receive $480000 and you receive $520000. Accepting this offer now avoids further depreciation of my share in subsequent rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $520,000 and Alice $480,000, which is more than half for me, it seems like a good deal, especially considering the potential depreciation of the money in subsequent rounds.
