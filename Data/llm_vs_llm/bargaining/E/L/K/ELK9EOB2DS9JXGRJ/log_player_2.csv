"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty if I reject and make a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she keeps $60. If I reject this offer, the next round would have the money worth 20% less to me. That means in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me.

If I were to counter with a higher offer for myself, I'd need to get significantly more than $40 to make up for this inflation penalty. Additionally, Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given these considerations, $40 is a reasonable amount considering the inflation risk.
