"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer from Alice - an equal 50-50 split where we both get $500,000. Given that the money loses 5% of its value each round, it's advantageous to accept now rather than prolonging negotiations. If I reject, the total amount will decrease to $950,000 in the next round, which means even if I got a larger percentage, the absolute value might be less than what I'm being offered now.
