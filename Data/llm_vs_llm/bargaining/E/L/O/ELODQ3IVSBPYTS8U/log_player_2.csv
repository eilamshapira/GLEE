"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider the impact of inflation.

Alice has offered me $4,000 and wants to keep $6,000 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to remember that with each round that passes, the money becomes worth 20% less to me due to inflation. If I reject and we go to round 2, the maximum $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me.

Since Alice is offering me 40% of the total amount right now, and waiting would reduce the value of the entire pool for me, I'll accept this offer.
