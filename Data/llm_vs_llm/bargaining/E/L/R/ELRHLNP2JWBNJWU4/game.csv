600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, waiting is costly for me. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing us to conclude this quickly.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm facing 10% inflation each round, and I need to ensure I get a fair share. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, now that we both know our inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you), we should find a fair agreement quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor accounts for my higher inflation rate. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value - but I lose more. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,3,

460000.0,540000.0,"Alice, I understand your situation, but I need to account for my inflation rate as well. Let's meet in the middle with a 54-46 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before inflation takes a bigger toll.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a middle ground that's fair given our inflation rates. With my 20% inflation compared to your 10%, time hurts me twice as much. This 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose significant value - I've already lost nearly 50% of my potential value, and you've lost over 27%. Let's settle now before we both lose more.",Alice,5,
