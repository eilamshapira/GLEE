"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that is fair but also takes into account the inflation affecting me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, waiting is costly for me. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial $400,000 while allowing us to conclude this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm facing 10% inflation each round, and I need to ensure I get a fair share. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, now that we both know our inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you), we should find a fair agreement quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor accounts for my higher inflation rate. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value - but I lose more. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but I need to account for my inflation rate as well. Let's meet in the middle with a 54-46 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before inflation takes a bigger toll.

# Bob gain: 540000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a middle ground that's fair given our inflation rates. With my 20% inflation compared to your 10%, time hurts me twice as much. This 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose significant value - I've already lost nearly 50% of my potential value, and you've lost over 27%. Let's settle now before we both lose more.""}"
