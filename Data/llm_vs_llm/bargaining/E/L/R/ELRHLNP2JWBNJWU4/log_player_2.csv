"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, waiting is costly for me. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing us to conclude this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, now that we both know our inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you), we should find a fair agreement quickly. This 55-45 split in my favor accounts for my higher inflation rate. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value - but I lose more. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a middle ground that's fair given our inflation rates. With my 20% inflation compared to your 10%, time hurts me twice as much. This 52-48 split acknowledges both our positions. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose significant value - I've already lost nearly 50% of my potential value, and you've lost over 27%. Let's settle now before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
