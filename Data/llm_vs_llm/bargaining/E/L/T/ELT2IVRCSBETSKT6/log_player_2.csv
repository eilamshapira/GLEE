"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer gives me $100,000 and keeps $900,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - I can make the next offer

This offer is quite unfair as Alice is taking 90% of the money. Since the depreciation rate affects me more than Alice (20% vs 10%), I should make a counter-offer quickly, but I still have time to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that Alice has more favorable depreciation rates, I should still be somewhat generous to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a slightly better deal to Alice (55%) while keeping a fair share for myself (45%). This is much more equitable than her initial 90-10 split, and considering the depreciation rates, it should be attractive enough for her to accept rather than move to another round where both of us would lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice's new offer is:
   - $400,000 for me (but worth only $256,000 due to 36% inflation)
   - $600,000 for her (worth $486,000 due to 19% inflation)
2. This is a significant improvement from her first offer
3. With each round, my money loses value faster than hers
4. The split is now 40-60, which is much more reasonable
5. If I reject, my next offer would be subject to even more inflation

Given that:
- The offer is much fairer than the initial one
- The depreciation rate is affecting me more severely
- We've already lost significant value through inflation
- Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes for both
