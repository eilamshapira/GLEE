"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll analyze this situation and make a strategic offer.

Since Bob suffers from 10% inflation each round while I don't face any inflation, I have a timing advantage. If we reach later rounds, Bob will be more willing to accept less money because its value to him decreases.

However, I don't want to be too aggressive in my first offer and risk rejection, which would push us to more rounds. I'll make a reasonable but advantageous first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the million dollars with me getting $600,000 and you getting $400,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation you face in future rounds."
