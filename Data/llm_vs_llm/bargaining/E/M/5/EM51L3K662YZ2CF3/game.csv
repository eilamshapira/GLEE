550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. Given that inflation impacts me by 10% each round, this split recognizes the time pressure I face while still giving you a substantial portion. If we move to another round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now.",Alice,1,
