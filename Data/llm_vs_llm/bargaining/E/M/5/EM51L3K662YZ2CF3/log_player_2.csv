"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. Given that inflation impacts me by 10% each round, this split recognizes the time pressure I face while still giving you a substantial portion. If we move to another round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
