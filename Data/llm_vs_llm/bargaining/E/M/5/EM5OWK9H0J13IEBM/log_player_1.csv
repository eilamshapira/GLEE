"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Given that inflation affects me more significantly (20% per round) compared to Bob (5% per round), I should propose a reasonable split that Bob would accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and given the asymmetric inflation penalties, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement early rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation effects carefully. After two rounds, my money is worth 20% less per round, and Bob's is worth 5% less per round.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the ongoing inflation impact. Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round), continuing to negotiate is more costly for me. This offer gives Bob a larger share than my initial proposal while still ensuring I receive a reasonable portion. Given the asymmetric inflation effects, this should be mutually beneficial rather than continuing to later rounds where both of us would lose more value."
