"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is a 50-50 split of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * The money is worth 5% less to me ($9,500 total value)
   * The money is worth 20% less to Alice ($8,000 total value)
3. Due to the high inflation rate for Alice (20%), I would have more negotiating power in the next round
4. Alice would be more likely to accept a less favorable deal in the next round due to her higher inflation rate

Based on this analysis, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is now worth less to both of us (5% less for me, 20% less for Alice), and I know Alice faces steeper inflation in future rounds, I can propose a split more favorable to me. Alice should rationally accept this offer rather than risk another round of high inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $3,500 now is better than risking the next round where her purchasing power drops by 20%
2. This gives me a better deal than the initial 50-50 split
3. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $5,500 (worth about $4,965 due to 9.75% inflation)
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My inflation will increase further
   * Alice's inflation will become even more severe (would be over 50%)
   * The next round would mean even less value for both of us

This is actually a better offer than the initial 50-50 split, and with inflation eating into our potential gains, it would be risky to reject this. Even if I could negotiate a slightly better split in the next round, the inflation would likely negate any gains.
