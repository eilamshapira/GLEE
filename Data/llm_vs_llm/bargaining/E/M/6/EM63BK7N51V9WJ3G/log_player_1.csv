"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair division that considers inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob. I'm asking for a slightly higher amount ($55) because I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
