"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 45$ in the first round, that's a decent offer. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but due to 20% inflation, even if I propose a better split for myself, the money will be worth less. 

For example, if I got 60$ next round, due to 20% inflation it would only be worth 48$ to me - not much better than the 45$ I'm being offered now.

Since this is a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I'll accept.
