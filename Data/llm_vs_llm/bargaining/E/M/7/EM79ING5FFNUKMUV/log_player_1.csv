"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for future losses due to inflation and the risk of reaching the 12-round limit:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm asking for a slightly larger share (55%) because I'm making the first offer. This is a common strategy in negotiation games.
*   I'm offering Bob a significant portion (45%) to make the offer attractive enough that he'll accept it. The goal is to secure a reasonable outcome now rather than risk losing value later."
