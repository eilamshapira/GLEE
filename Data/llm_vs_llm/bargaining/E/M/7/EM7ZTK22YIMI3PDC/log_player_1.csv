"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose that Bob receives $520,000 and I receive $480,000. This is a fair split with a slight advantage to Bob to incentivize acceptance in the first round, avoiding the risk of multiple rounds of negotiation."
