"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would receive $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by negotiating further. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round where I can make a counter-offer.

Alice's current proposal gives her 60% of the total amount, which isn't an equal split. I believe I can propose a more balanced division in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share of $500,000. Since there's no inflation penalty for either of us in my understanding, this seems like the most equitable solution.""}"
