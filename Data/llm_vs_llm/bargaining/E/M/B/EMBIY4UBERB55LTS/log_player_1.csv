"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable as an opening offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while accounting for the risk of inflation if we continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me, especially since I'm only facing 5% inflation per round while Bob is facing 20% inflation. This gives me a stronger negotiating position. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob is facing higher inflation (20% per round) compared to my 5%, and he rejected my initial 60-40 split, I'll adjust slightly but maintain a strong position.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a more balanced offer than my first one, but still gives me an advantage considering the inflation differences. Bob should be motivated to accept since his money will lose value faster than mine in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Bob is facing much steeper inflation (48.8%) compared to my 14.26%. Given this significant difference in inflation rates, I have a stronger negotiating position. Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine, so he should be more eager to reach a deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's inflation rate (20% per round) is much higher than mine (5% per round), and we're already in round 5, Bob's money is losing value much faster. He should be more eager to make a deal now.

{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000}

I propose I get $575,000 and Bob gets $425,000. This is actually a better deal for Bob than it might appear, because if we continue negotiating, his share will be worth significantly less due to his higher inflation rate. It's in his best interest to accept this offer now rather than continue negotiating and lose more value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Bob's money is already worth 67.23% less while mine is only worth 22.62% less
2. If we continue negotiating, we risk further devaluation
3. Getting $475,000 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
4. We're halfway through our rounds, and the risk of not reaching an agreement increases
5. After inflation, this is actually a better deal for me than it appears nominally, given the large difference in our inflation rates"
