"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since your money loses value faster. This way we both benefit from making a deal now rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and considering the inflation, it's better to end the game now rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $500,000 Ã— 0.95 = $475,000 (in round 1 value)
* If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
* Bob's urgency should be even higher since his inflation is 10%
* However, a 50-50 split doesn't account for Bob's higher inflation rate, which should give me negotiating leverage

Due to your 10% inflation rate, this $420,000 now is worth more than $500,000 in the next round. We should conclude this now for mutual benefit.""}"
