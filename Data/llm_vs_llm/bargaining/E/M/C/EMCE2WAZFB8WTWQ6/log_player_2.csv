Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to your 10% inflation rate, this $420000 now is worth more than $500000 in the next round. We should conclude this now for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000
