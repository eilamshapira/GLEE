"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for her.

Given that inflation reduces the value of money each round (5% less for me and 10% less for Alice), rejecting now means any future amount would be worth less. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice would face 10% inflation on whatever amount I propose.

Since we have 12 rounds total and need to reach agreement, and considering the differential inflation rates that favor me slightly in later rounds, I think I can propose a more equitable split in round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more equitable while acknowledging the inflation factors.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of $5,000 each. This is fair and recognizes that with each passing round, both of us lose value due to inflation. Since Alice faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), accepting this balanced offer now would be in her best interest rather than continuing to later rounds where her share would be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's new offer of $4,200 for me and $5,800 for her.

Alice has moved $200 in my direction from her initial offer, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, we're still in the early rounds (round 3 of 12), and the inflation impact is still relatively moderate.

Given that Alice faces higher inflation (10% per round vs my 5% per round), her incentive to reach an agreement should increase in later rounds more quickly than mine. If I make a counter-offer in round 4, I might be able to secure a better deal, and Alice may be more inclined to accept as her potential gains decrease more rapidly with time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $5,200 and Alice receives $4,800. This is a fair offer considering we're now in round 4 and inflation is affecting both of us - with Alice's inflation rate being higher at 10% per round compared to my 5%. 

This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while reflecting the stronger negotiating position I have due to the differential inflation rates. Accepting now would be beneficial for both of us rather than extending negotiations further when both our shares would be worth less, particularly Alice's portion which depreciates faster."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has gradually increased her offers to me: $4000, then $4200, and now $4400. We're in round 5 of 12, and inflation is becoming significant - my potential gain is worth 18.55% less than in round 1, while Alice's is worth 34.39% less.

Given that Alice's inflation rate (10% per round) is double mine (5% per round), her incentive to reach an agreement should be stronger than mine. However, she's still only offering me 44% of the total. Since we're still less than halfway through our negotiation window, I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,300 and Alice receives $4,700. We're now in round 6 of 12, and inflation is significantly impacting both of us - particularly Alice, whose money is losing value at 10% per round compared to my 5%.

This offer represents a slight moderation from my previous proposal, showing my willingness to compromise. Given that we're halfway through our negotiation window and Alice's portion is depreciating twice as fast as mine, this offer provides her with a substantial amount that will be worth more now than if we continue further rounds. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than letting inflation erode the total value available to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice is gradually increasing her offers ($4000, $4200, $4400, now $4600), moving toward a more equitable split. We're now in round 7 of 12, with significant inflation impact - my potential gain is worth 26.49% less than in round 1, while Alice's is worth a substantial 46.86% less.

Alice faces much steeper inflation than I do, yet we're moving closer to an even split with each round. If this pattern continues, we might reach near-parity in later rounds, but with significantly diminished real value for both of us.

Since we're more than halfway through our negotiation window and the inflation difference is becoming quite pronounced, accepting now would secure me $4600 rather than risking further depreciation.
