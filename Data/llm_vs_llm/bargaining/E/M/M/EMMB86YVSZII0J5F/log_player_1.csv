"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer. Given that I want to be fair but also maximize my gain, I'll propose an even split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I think a 50-50 split is a fair starting point. We both get an equal share of the money, and there's no need to continue to additional rounds where inflation might reduce the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer based on what I've learned. Since Bob rejected my 50-50 split and tried to get more for himself, and considering that he faces 20% inflation per round, I'll adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than half, which should be attractive to him given that inflation will reduce his value by 20% if we go to another round. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests."
