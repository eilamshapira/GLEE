"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonably fair to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, the next round's total value will be worth 5% less to me
3. Bob might accept this rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $400,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's only worth $380,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob seems to be trying to take advantage of my inflation pressure
4. However, making a counter-offer means even more value loss for me

Even though this offer is less favorable than my initial proposal, the inflation effect makes it risky to continue negotiating. If I reject, I'll lose another 5% value in the next round, which could make me worse off.
