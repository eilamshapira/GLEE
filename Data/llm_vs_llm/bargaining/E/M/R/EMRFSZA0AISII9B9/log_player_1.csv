"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we split it equally? It's fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $400,000 to me (80% of $500,000).

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the third round, the money I gain is now worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80%).

With that in mind, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money to me. I'll offer Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal, consider it!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you rejected my equal split, I'm taking a bit more this time. But it's still fair considering the inflation for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the $450,000 I would receive is actually worth approximately $231,200 to me (51.2% of $450,000, which is 100% - 48.8%).

Considering this significant decrease in value, I think Bob's offer is not too bad, especially since he's taking into account the inflation affecting me. I'll accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of the money.
