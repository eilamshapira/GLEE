"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges both the time pressure and our different inflation rates. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to agree early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair 60-40 split. Given your higher inflation rate of 10% per round, this is a good deal for you. If we delay, we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable given the difference in our inflation rates.  Let's aim for a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation rates actually work in my favor - Bob's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), which means he should be more eager to reach a deal quickly. By waiting, his position weakens more than mine. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be pragmatic, Bob. Your money is devaluing at 10% per round, while mine at 5%. Already your 600K from last round would be worth only 486K in real value. This 55-45 split gives you 450K now, which is better than waiting. Let's make a deal.""}"
