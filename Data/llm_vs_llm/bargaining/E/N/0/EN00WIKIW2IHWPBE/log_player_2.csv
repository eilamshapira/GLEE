# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be pragmatic, Bob. Your money is devaluing at 10% per round, while mine at 5%. Already your 600K from last round would be worth only 486K in real value. This 55-45 split gives you 450K now, which is better than waiting. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
