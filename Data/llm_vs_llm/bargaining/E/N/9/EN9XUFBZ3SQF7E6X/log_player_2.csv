"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle quickly before inflation eats into my share. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you so we both lock in our gains early. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, the money is still worth its full value to me. Considering Alice's offer, I think $45 is a bit low, but it's also important to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation factor, I want to make a fair offer that also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

I'll offer $50 to Alice and $50 to myself. This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm also considering the fact that the money is worth 10% less to me now.
