Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further rounds and the erosion of value on my side, I’d like to settle now. I propose the same fair split you suggested – you receive $60 and I get $40. Let’s wrap this up quickly so we both get our payouts. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
