"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, considering the shrinking value of the money for both of us with each round. In the first round, the inflation isn't a significant factor yet, but I need to start thinking strategically.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself in this first round. This is based on the assumption that Bob might be more inclined to accept a seemingly generous offer early on, before the inflation really starts to bite. It also gives me a bit of a buffer if I need to concede more in later rounds. I believe that a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering that I have more inflation than Bob."
