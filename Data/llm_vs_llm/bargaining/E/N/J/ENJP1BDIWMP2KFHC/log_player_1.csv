I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm confident I can get a better deal later if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than his last offer, but I'm still giving him a significant amount. This is to incentivize him to accept, while still being fair to myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm increasing my offer slightly to try and secure an agreement. I'm still losing value due to inflation, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of getting a deal done rather than risking more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt significantly, and while I'd prefer a higher share, the risk of getting nothing is now too high. I'll accept this offer."
