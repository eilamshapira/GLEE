"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer, considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a slightly favorable split for me but still quite fair, considering I risk losing 10% value each round if we don't agree quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation for me, $5000 is now worth $4500 to me. If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth even less due to another 10% inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further devaluation and potential failure to reach an agreement makes this offer reasonable.
