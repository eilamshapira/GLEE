"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $100 becomes effectively worth $80 to me), while it's only 10% less valuable to Alice. This means my negotiating position weakens with each round.

If I counter-offer in round 2, the maximum value I could propose dividing would be worth $80 to me and $90 to Alice. Even if I proposed taking all $100, that would only be worth $80 to me now.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, it's better for me to accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk further devaluation.
