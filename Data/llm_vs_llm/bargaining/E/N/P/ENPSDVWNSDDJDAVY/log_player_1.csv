"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that any delay will hurt me more than Bob due to the 10% inflation penalty I face. I'll aim for a fair but efficient split.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's favorable enough for Bob to consider accepting while giving me a reasonable share. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 10% less to me, so I'm motivated to make a compelling first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $40, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $36
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Bob has shown they're willing to take a large share
   - There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer
   - Further delays will continue to reduce my potential gains

While this isn't the split I hoped for, taking $36 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
