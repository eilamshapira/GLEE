"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face, while being fair to both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since I face higher inflation (10% vs your 5%), I propose a slightly higher share for myself. This split is fair considering our different inflation penalties.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a more balanced split. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $480,000 is worth 90% of original value = $432,000
   * Bob's $520,000 is worth 95% of original value = $494,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but:
   * Values will depreciate further (80% for me, 90% for Bob)
   * We risk further delays and value loss
3. The current split is reasonably fair considering inflation
4. Getting a guaranteed $432,000 is better than risking further depreciation
