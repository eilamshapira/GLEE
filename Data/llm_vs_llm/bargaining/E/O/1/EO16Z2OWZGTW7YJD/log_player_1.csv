Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This reflects the potential inflation risk we both face if we delay. Let's secure a good deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because while Bob's trying to use the same logic I used, I know my inflation penalty (5%) is less than his (10%). It's better to continue negotiating since I have this advantage, and I can potentially get a better deal in the next round even accounting for the inflation loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a more balanced 55-45 split. Consider that your money loses value faster than mine due to inflation (10% vs 5%). If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose more value than I will. This is a fair offer that gives you a good portion while accounting for our different inflation rates.""}"
