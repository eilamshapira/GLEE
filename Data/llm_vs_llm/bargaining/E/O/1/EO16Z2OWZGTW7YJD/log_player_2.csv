Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a more balanced 55-45 split. Consider that your money loses value faster than mine due to inflation (10% vs 5%). If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose more value than I will. This is a fair offer that gives you a good portion while accounting for our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
