"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 of the $10,000 total, which is 40%. If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me, meaning the total value to me would be $8,000. 40% of that would be $3,200, which is less than the current offer.

However, if I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $4,000 despite the inflation. Let me reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's reasonable while accounting for the inflation effect I'm experiencing.

Since the money is now worth 20% less to me (effectively $8,000 in value from my perspective), I should aim for a division that recognizes this reality while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. Since Alice knows I'm experiencing inflation, this should appear reasonable to her. If she rejects this offer, she'll have to make a counter-offer in round 3, but by then, the money will be worth even less to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer considering the inflation effect.

At this point, the money is worth 36% less to me than in the first round. If the total amount is $10,000, then due to inflation, it's only worth $6,400 to me (64% of the original value).

Alice is offering me $4,500, which is 45% of the total $10,000. This is better than her first offer of $4,000.

If I reject and move to round 4, the inflation would reduce the value further for me. The $4,500 offer now is likely better than what I could reasonably get in the next round after additional inflation.

Given the diminishing value due to inflation and the improved offer from Alice, I'll accept this proposal.
