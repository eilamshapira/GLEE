"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the 12‑round division game (where each round reduces the total amount by 10%), the subgame‑perfect equilibrium gives the proposer an advantage that shrinks as the rounds progress. Working backward from round 12 (where the proposer can secure nearly all of the remaining money) to round 1 yields the following approximate fractions:

• In round 12 the proposer keeps almost 100% (responder gets 0).  
• In round 11, the proposer must offer the responder enough so that the responder is indifferent to waiting until round 12. This forces the round‑11 proposer to keep roughly 10% of the round‑11 pot and give about 90% to the responder.  
• Continuing this reasoning, in round 1 (with the full $10,000 at stake), the calculation shows that if Bob (the responder in round 1) rejects, he will be in a position in round 2 where he can secure approximately 69.15% of the round‑2 pot (which is 90% of $10,000 = $9,000). In dollar terms his continuation value is roughly 0.6915 × 9000 ≈ $6,223.31.  

Therefore, as Alice the round‑1 proposer, to make Bob just as well‑off accepting as waiting for his turn, you should offer him about $6,223.31 and keep about $3,776.69 for yourself.

Here is the JSON offer for Round 1:
