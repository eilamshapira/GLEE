Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid decrease in value for both of us, I propose a split that still favors you less than an even split but compensates for the higher inflation rate you're facing. Let's end this quickly before our shares lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but that offer was too heavily skewed in your favor.  This is a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure while still being fair.""

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on you, I'm proposing a split that's closer to an even division but still accounts for your higher rate of value loss. Let's agree on this to minimize further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
Even though it's not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. Holding out might lead to even less favorable offers from Bob in the future."
