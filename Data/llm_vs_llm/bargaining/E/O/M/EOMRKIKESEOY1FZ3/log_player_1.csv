"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer to divide the $1,000,000, considering that we both want to maximize our gain and that the value decreases by 5% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest division, and accepting it now means we both get the maximum total value since the money will be worth less in future rounds due to the 5% inflation. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
