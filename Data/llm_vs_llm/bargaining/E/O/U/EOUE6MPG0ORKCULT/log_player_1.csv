"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you like a fair split, but as you know, every round costs me a bit due to inflation (5% each round). If you reject my offer, you’ll get to propose in round 3—but then I’ll be forced to accept an outcome that, in equilibrium, leaves you with only about $22.62 nominally. To avoid further loss (on my side) and a longer game for both of us, I propose that I receive $77.38 and you receive $22.62. I believe this offer reflects the real costs of delay from my perspective and gives you the same continuation value you’d secure by waiting. I hope you agree that accepting now is mutually beneficial. 
# Alice gain: 22.62 
# Bob gain: 77.38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
