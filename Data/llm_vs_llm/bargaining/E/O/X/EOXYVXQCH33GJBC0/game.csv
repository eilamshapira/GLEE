55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. Since we face 10% inflation each round on my side, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly rather than drag this out and lose value. This is a fair split considering the time pressure.",Alice,1,

51.0,49.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your point about inflation. Since each round costs me 5% in value (and I understand your situation might be even steeper), I’d like to propose a near-equal split now: I get $49 and you get $51. This division roughly equalizes our effective gains—about $46.55 for me (49 × 0.95) and $45.90 for you (51 × 0.90), considering the discount factors—and helps us avoid further losses. I hope we can agree quickly and secure our value. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
