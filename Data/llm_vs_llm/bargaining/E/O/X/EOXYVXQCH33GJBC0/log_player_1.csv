"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that the value decreases by 10% for me each round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. Since we face 10% inflation each round on my side, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly rather than drag this out and lose value. This is a fair split considering the time pressure.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your point about inflation. Since each round costs me 5% in value (and I understand your situation might be even steeper), I’d like to propose a near-equal split now: I get $49 and you get $51. This division roughly equalizes our effective gains—about $46.55 for me (49 × 0.95) and $45.90 for you (51 × 0.90), considering the discount factors—and helps us avoid further losses. I hope we can agree quickly and secure our value. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 51 
# Bob gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
