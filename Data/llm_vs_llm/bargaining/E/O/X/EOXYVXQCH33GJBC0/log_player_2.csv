"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. Since we face 10% inflation each round on my side, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly rather than drag this out and lose value. This is a fair split considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your point about inflation. Since each round costs me 5% in value (and I understand your situation might be even steeper), I’d like to propose a near-equal split now: I get $49 and you get $51. This division roughly equalizes our effective gains—about $46.55 for me (49 × 0.95) and $45.90 for you (51 × 0.90), considering the discount factors—and helps us avoid further losses. I hope we can agree quickly and secure our value. Looking forward to your response.""}"
