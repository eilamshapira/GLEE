3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we both know that with each round, your share loses 10% in value. By now, you've already lost 19% to inflation. My offer of $3500 to you now is worth more than waiting additional rounds where you'll lose even more value. This is a pragmatic solution given our different inflation rates.",Bob,4,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, your money is now worth over 34% less than in round 1 due to inflation, and this will only get worse. My offer of $3000 to you now is actually worth more than a larger number in future rounds. We're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation timeline, and continuing this back-and-forth is not beneficial for you given the inflation you face. This is a reasonable offer considering our different situations.",Bob,6,

2700.0,7300.0,"Alice, we're now in round 8 of 12, and your money has lost nearly 47% of its value since round 1. At this point, $2700 now is worth more to you than a larger amount later due to the continued 10% inflation you face each round. We're running out of rounds, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. This offer acknowledges the reality of our situation and gives you meaningful value before inflation erodes it further.",Bob,8,
