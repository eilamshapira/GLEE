"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 10% depreciation you face each round, I'm offering you $4000 now which is better than waiting further rounds. This is a fair split given our different time constraints. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% depreciation, I'll have to think carefully about my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 to me.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2).

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that with each round, your share loses 10% in value. By now, you've already lost 19% to inflation. My offer of $3500 to you now is worth more than waiting additional rounds where you'll lose even more value. This is a pragmatic solution given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob!

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 30% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, and 9.1% less - 10% of 90% -  in Round 3, and I will calculate the actual loss as (10% + 10% + 9.1%) = 29.1%, for simplicity I will use 27.1% and 10% for the next round as given, but I will keep the actual numbers in mind for future calculations), but I will use the given numbers.

The $3500 offered to me is actually worth $3500 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = $2546.50 to me.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I have to think about the risk of losing even more value due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 37.1% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, 9.1% less in Round 3, and 10% of 72.9% which is 7.29% less in Round 4, so total is 10% + 10% + 9.1% + 7.29% = 36.39%, for simplicity I will use 37.1% as given).

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a fair share considering the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your money is now worth over 34% less than in round 1 due to inflation, and this will only get worse. My offer of $3000 to you now is actually worth more than a larger number in future rounds. We're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation timeline, and continuing this back-and-forth is not beneficial for you given the inflation you face. This is a reasonable offer considering our different situations. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob!

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 40.95% less than the original value.

The $3000 offered to me is actually worth $3000 * 0.5905 (1 - 0.4095) = $1765.50 to me.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I need to think carefully about my next move. Bob's offer is not very generous, but I have to consider the risk of losing even more value due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 46.41% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, 9.1% less in Round 3, 7.29% less in Round 4, and 10% of 62.9% which is 6.29% less in Round 5, and 10% of 59.05% which is 5.91% less in Round 6, so total is 10% + 10% + 9.1% + 7.29% + 6.29% + 5.91% = 48.49%, for simplicity I will use the given numbers and calculate the next depreciation as 10% of 59.05% which is 5.905%, and total depreciation so far as 40.95% + 5.905% = 46.855%, and for simplicity I will use 46.41% as given, and the next depreciation will be 10% of 53.59% which is 5.359%).

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 8 of 12, and your money has lost nearly 47% of its value since round 1. At this point, $2700 now is worth more to you than a larger amount later due to the continued 10% inflation you face each round. We're running out of rounds, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. This offer acknowledges the reality of our situation and gives you meaningful value before inflation erodes it further. 
# Alice gain: 2700 
# Bob gain: 7300 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob!

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 52.17% less than the original value.

The $2700 offered to me is actually worth $2700 * 0.4783 (1 - 0.5217) = $1291.91 to me.

I'm feeling the pressure of inflation and the limited number of rounds left. Bob's offer is still not very generous, but I have to consider the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement before Round 12.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it's my turn again.
