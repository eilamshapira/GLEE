"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a split where I get $5500 and she gets $4500.

Since I get no penalty for delaying (my money is worth 0% less each round), while Alice loses 10% value each round, I have a strategic advantage. If we continue to later rounds, Alice's position weakens.

I could make a counter-offer in the next round that would give me a better share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that acknowledges the time pressure Alice faces while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the 10% depreciation you face each round, I'm offering you $4000 now which is better than waiting further rounds. This is a fair split given our different time constraints.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's new offer of an even 50-50 split where we each get $5000.

Alice's position is weakening with each round due to the 10% inflation she faces per round. By round 3, her money is already worth 19% less than in round 1.

While this is an even numerical split, the strategic situation favors me waiting since I face no inflation penalty. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round when Alice's position further weakens.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we both know that with each round, your share loses 10% in value. By now, you've already lost 19% to inflation. My offer of $3500 to you now is worth more than waiting additional rounds where you'll lose even more value. This is a pragmatic solution given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a fair share considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I get $5800 and she gets $4200.

Alice's position continues to weaken due to inflation. By round 5, her money is worth 34.39% less than in round 1, which significantly impacts her eventual payout.

While Alice has improved her offer to me compared to round 3, I still have the strategic advantage. Since I face no inflation penalty, I can afford to wait for an even better deal in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, 
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, your money is now worth over 34% less than in round 1 due to inflation, and this will only get worse. My offer of $3000 to you now is actually worth more than a larger number in future rounds. We're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation timeline, and continuing this back-and-forth is not beneficial for you given the inflation you face. This is a reasonable offer considering our different situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still open to negotiation, but I need a more reasonable split considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 6200 
# Alice gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I get $6200 and she gets $3800.

By round 7, Alice's money has lost 46.86% of its value compared to round 1. This means her $3800 is effectively worth only about $2020 in round 1 terms.

Alice has improved her offer to me compared to round 5, which shows she's feeling the pressure of inflation. However, given my strategic advantage of facing no inflation, and the fact that we're now more than halfway through our negotiation timeline, I could potentially get an even better deal by waiting.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7300, 
""alice_gain"": 2700,
""message"": ""Alice, we're now in round 8 of 12, and your money has lost nearly 47% of its value since round 1. At this point, $2700 now is worth more to you than a larger amount later due to the continued 10% inflation you face each round. We're running out of rounds, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. This offer acknowledges the reality of our situation and gives you meaningful value before inflation erodes it further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm evaluating Alice's offer where I get $6800 and she gets $3200.

By round 9, Alice's money has lost 56.95% of its value compared to round 1, making her $3200 effectively worth only about $1378 in round 1 terms.

Alice has improved her offer significantly, now offering me $6800 which is much better than her previous offers. We're also in round 9 of 12, leaving only 3 more rounds to reach an agreement before we both get nothing.

While I could potentially push for an even better deal, there's increasing risk that we'll run out of rounds. Alice's concession indicates she understands her weakening position.
