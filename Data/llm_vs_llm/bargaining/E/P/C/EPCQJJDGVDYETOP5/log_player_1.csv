"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I will reject this offer. While it's similar to my initial proposal but reversed, I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3 and the money is worth about 10% less than initially, I'll make a more balanced offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a completely equal split of $50 each. This is fair to both parties, and considering the continuing inflation penalty, we should try to reach an agreement soon."
