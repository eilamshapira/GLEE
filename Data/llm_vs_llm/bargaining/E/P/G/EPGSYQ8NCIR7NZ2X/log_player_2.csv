"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. Given that we have 12 rounds, and the money loses 10% of value for me each round, I need to consider if rejecting is worth it.

If I reject now, I can make a counteroffer in round 2, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me. The longer we negotiate, the less value I receive due to the inflation penalty that only affects me.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice rejects future offers, and we both end up with nothing after 12 rounds. Getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing later.
