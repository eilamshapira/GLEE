"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's start fair and split the money equally. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this...

With a fair 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my share would need to be at least $625,000 to be better than accepting now (to make up for the 20% loss in value).

Given that:
1. This is a fair opening offer
2. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer
4. We could risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I think it's wise to accept this fair offer now rather than risk losing value through inflation or potential disagreement.
