"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This doesn't seem like a fair split, especially given our different inflation rates. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, though the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 5% for Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given our different inflation rates, I need to account for that in my proposal. Since money is worth 10% less to me each round but only 5% less to Alice, we should find a compromise that acknowledges this asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split which is fair. If we continue to another round, we both lose value due to inflation, with me losing more (10%) than you (5%). This is mutually beneficial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle of my initial offer and your 50-50 proposal 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer. Alice has increased my share from her initial 400,000 to 430,000, but it's still not balanced considering our different inflation rates. At this point, the money is worth 19% less to me, so even more reason to seek fair terms.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I would face 29% total inflation versus Alice's 14.75% - our inflation gap continues to widen, which puts me at a disadvantage.
