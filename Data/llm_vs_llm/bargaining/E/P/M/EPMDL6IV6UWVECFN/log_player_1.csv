"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer. Since we both need to agree, and there's potential for multiple rounds, I'll propose a slightly favorable but not extreme split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split as a starting point for negotiation. This gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a favorable position for myself."
