"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. This is not an equal split, but I need to consider inflation. If I reject, the money loses 5% value for me in the next round.

Let me evaluate this: $400,000 now is better than potentially $500,000 next round after 5% inflation (which would be worth $475,000 to me). Plus, there's no guarantee Alice would accept an offer I make.
