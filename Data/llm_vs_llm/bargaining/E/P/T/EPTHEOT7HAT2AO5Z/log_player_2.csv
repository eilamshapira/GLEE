"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer in the context of our game.

Alice is offering me $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While I would receive a substantial amount, I have an opportunity to make a counter-offer since:

1. I don't face any inflation penalty (my money is worth the same in every round)
2. Alice faces 10% inflation per round (her money loses value)
3. We have many rounds remaining

I believe I can propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, knowing that Alice's negotiating position weakens with each passing round due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges both our interests while considering the inflation impact on Alice's side.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair proposal considering that time works in my favor due to the asymmetric inflation. If Alice rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth 10% less, so accepting now is in her best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in round 3.

Alice is now offering me $420,000, which is $20,000 more than her initial offer. However, this is still significantly lower than what I proposed in round 2. 

I notice that Alice's position is weakening due to inflation - her money is already worth 19% less than in round 1. If we continue to the next round, her position will deteriorate further as the inflation effect compounds.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to be patient and seek a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a more strategic counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account the growing inflation effect on Alice's side.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering Alice $420,000 while taking $580,000 for myself. This is a reasonable proposal considering that inflation has already reduced the value of Alice's money by 19%, and it will decrease by another 10% in the next round if she rejects. Since I'm not affected by inflation, time is on my side. This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while acknowledging the game dynamics that favor my position as rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer in round 5.

Alice is now offering me $440,000, which is $40,000 more than her initial offer and $20,000 more than her offer in round 3. However, this is still significantly less favorable than what I proposed in round 4.

The inflation effect on Alice's side is becoming substantial - her money is now worth 34.39% less than in round 1. If we continue to the next round, her position will deteriorate even further.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty and we're only in round 5 of 12 possible rounds, I still have considerable leverage. I'll reject this offer and make another proposal that reflects the shifting bargaining position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the increasing inflation impact on Alice's side.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Alice $400,000 while taking $600,000 for myself. This proposal reflects the reality that inflation has already reduced the value of Alice's money by over 34%, and it will decrease by another 10% in the next round if she rejects. We're now halfway through our possible rounds, and my negotiating position continues to strengthen since I'm not affected by inflation. This offer gives Alice a substantial amount that will still be worth significantly more now than if she waits several more rounds to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer in round 7.

Alice is now offering me $460,000, which is $20,000 more than her previous offer. However, her negotiating position continues to weaken significantly - her money is now worth 46.86% less than in round 1.

This means that the $540,000 Alice is asking for is only worth about $286,956 compared to round 1's value (540,000 × (1-0.4686)). Meanwhile, my $460,000 maintains its full value.

While Alice is gradually increasing her offers to me, we still have 5 more potential rounds, and the inflation effect will continue to erode her position. Since I face no inflation penalty, I can afford to hold out for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that reflects our current negotiating positions.

{""bob_gain"": 620000, ""alice_gain"": 380000}

I'm offering Alice $380,000 while taking $620,000 for myself. This proposal accounts for the significant inflation impact that has already reduced Alice's money value by nearly 47%. If she rejects this offer, her money will be worth even less in the next round due to the additional 10% inflation.

We're now in round 8 of 12, approaching the end of our negotiation window. This offer gives Alice a substantial amount that maintains more value now than if she continues to delay for multiple rounds. The inflationary pressure on Alice's side makes accepting a reasonable offer now increasingly in her best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer in round 9.

Alice is now offering me $480,000, which is a $20,000 increase from her previous offer. However, her position continues to deteriorate significantly due to inflation - her money is now worth 56.95% less than in round 1.

This means the $520,000 Alice is asking for is only worth about $223,860 compared to round 1's value (520,000 × (1-0.5695)). Meanwhile, my $480,000 maintains its full value.

We're now in round 9 of 12, with only 3 more potential rounds remaining. The inflation effect is severely impacting Alice's position, and she's been steadily increasing her offers to me. However, given the extreme inflation effect and the few remaining rounds, I believe I can still secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that reflects our current negotiating positions with just a few rounds remaining.

{""bob_gain"": 640000, ""alice_gain"": 360000}

I'm offering Alice $360,000 while taking $640,000 for myself. This proposal recognizes the severe inflation impact that has already reduced Alice's money value by nearly 57%. If she rejects this offer, her money in the next round will be worth even less due to the additional 10% inflation.

We're now in round 10 of 12, with very little time remaining to reach an agreement. With only two potential rounds left after this one, Alice faces significant pressure to accept a reasonable offer now. Given that her $360,000 today is worth more than a potentially larger amount in the final rounds due to continued inflation, this offer represents a fair conclusion to our negotiation under the game's parameters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer in round 11.

Alice is now offering me $500,000 - a 50/50 split of the money. This is a $20,000 increase from her previous offer. However, her position has deteriorated dramatically due to inflation - her money is now worth 65.13% less than in round 1.

This means the $500,000 Alice is asking for is only worth about $174,350 compared to round 1's value (500,000 × (1-0.6513)). Meanwhile, my $500,000 maintains its full value.

We're now in round 11 of 12, with only one more potential round remaining. If we don't reach an agreement by the end of round 12, we both get nothing. Considering the extreme inflation effect, the nearly equal nominal split, and that we're approaching the final round, I should carefully weigh my options.

Given these factors, I'll accept Alice's offer:
