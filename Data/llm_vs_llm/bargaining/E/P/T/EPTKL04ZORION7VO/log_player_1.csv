"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's fair to consider the value decrease in each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

400000 * 0.9 = 360000

This is a significant decrease, and Bob's offer doesn't seem favorable to me. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 40% less (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2).

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, let's settle on a 65/35 split in my favor""}"
