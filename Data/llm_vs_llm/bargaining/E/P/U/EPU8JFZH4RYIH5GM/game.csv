60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since my money loses value each round. This way we can both walk away happy without wasting time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice! Let's keep it simple and split the amount equally. This way, neither of us loses out too much due to the diminishing value over rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but due to inflation, my money is worth 20% less at this point. A 55-45 split would make us closer to truly equal in real value. Let's agree and end this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,Hi Alice! How about we compromise a bit more? I understand your concern about inflation. My offer gives you a slightly bigger share than an equal split considering the inflation effect on your side.,Bob,4,
