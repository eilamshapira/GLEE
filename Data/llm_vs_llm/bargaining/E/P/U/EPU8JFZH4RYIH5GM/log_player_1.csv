"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since my money loses value each round. This way we can both walk away happy without wasting time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's keep it simple and split the amount equally. This way, neither of us loses out too much due to the diminishing value over rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Explanation (not part of response): I reject because with 10% inflation, $50 is only worth $45 to me now, while Bob gets full $50 value. I can make a counter-offer that accounts for this inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but due to inflation, my money is worth 20% less at this point. A 55-45 split would make us closer to truly equal in real value. Let's agree and end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! How about we compromise a bit more? I understand your concern about inflation. My offer gives you a slightly bigger share than an equal split considering the inflation effect on your side. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Explanation (not part of response): While this isn't a perfect compensation for the 27.1% inflation I'm experiencing (my $52 is effectively worth about $37.91), continuing to negotiate would only make things worse for me due to increasing inflation. Bob is showing some willingness to compromise, and further rounds would just decrease my real value even more. Better to take this deal now than risk getting even less value in later rounds."
