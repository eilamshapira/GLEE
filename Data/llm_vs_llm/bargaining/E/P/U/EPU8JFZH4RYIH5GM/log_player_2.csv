Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice! Let's keep it simple and split the amount equally. This way, neither of us loses out too much due to the diminishing value over rounds.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but due to inflation, my money is worth 20% less at this point. A 55-45 split would make us closer to truly equal in real value. Let's agree and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Hi Alice! How about we compromise a bit more? I understand your concern about inflation. My offer gives you a slightly bigger share than an equal split considering the inflation effect on your side.""}"
