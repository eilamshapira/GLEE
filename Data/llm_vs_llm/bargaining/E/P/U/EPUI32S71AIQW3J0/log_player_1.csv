"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a significant amount, and accepting it now would protect us both from losing value to inflation in later rounds."
