"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep things fair and split the $1000000 right down the middle. We both get $500000. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of an equal 50/50 split.

Alice is proposing a perfectly fair division where we both receive $500,000. This is a reasonable and equitable offer that gives us both substantial value. While I could potentially counter with a different proposal in the next round, there's no guarantee that would lead to a better outcome, and we'd be one round closer to potentially getting nothing.

Given that this is a fair offer right from the start, and considering the risk of ending up with nothing after 12 rounds, I'll accept this proposal.
