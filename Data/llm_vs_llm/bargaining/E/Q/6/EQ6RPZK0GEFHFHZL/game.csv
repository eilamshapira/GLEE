550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that gives you $450000 and me $550000. This slight difference accounts for the 5% discount you face each round. If we delay, your effective value decreases, so this is actually a very favorable deal for you right now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, given the 5% inflation, my offer gives you a little less than my effective gain. Take it or the value diminishes.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I've met you in the middle from my initial offer. This is fair because with inflation, your $475000 is worth about $451250 to you now (after 5% discount), while my $525000 remains at full value. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less. This is a balanced deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm being more generous this round. My effective gain is decreasing faster than yours. Let's finalize this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
515000.0,485000.0,"Bob, I'm making a concession to move us toward agreement. With the current inflation, your $485000 is actually worth about $415700 to you after the 14.26% discount. This is close to a 50/50 split in actual value. If we continue to future rounds, your share will be worth significantly less due to increasing inflation. This is a fair and reasonable offer considering our positions.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, last chance. My value is being seriously eroded. Take this split, or we both walk away with nothing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest possible division. However, due to the 22.62% inflation you're facing, your $500000 is actually worth about $387000 to you now. If we continue to round 8, you'll lose another 5% of value. This is my final concession - I've moved down from $515000 to $500000. Let's end this negotiation now with a perfectly equal nominal split before your share loses even more value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. With inflation, my effective gain is drastically less than what it seems, while your share is untouched. Accept this or neither of us will receive anything. Think of the value lost in each round!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Bob, I've moved significantly from my initial position. I'm now offering you $510000, which after the 30.17% inflation you're facing is worth about $356100 to you. Meanwhile, I would get $490000 at full value. This is actually advantageous to me, but we're running out of rounds. If we reach the final round with no agreement, we both get nothing. This is a reasonable compromise - I've increased your share from my last offer, showing my willingness to reach an agreement.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
410000.0,590000.0,"Alice, this is it. Last offer. Don't let it get to Round 12 or we'll both get nothing. This is my highest possible offer, and it is the best deal you will get.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, we're at the penultimate round. I've significantly conceded from my previous offers. I'm now offering you $550000, which even with 36.98% inflation is still worth about $346600 to you - very close to what I would get at $450000. This is my final offer. If we don't agree now, we'll go to the final round, and if we still don't agree, we both get ZERO. Let's be rational and make a deal that benefits both of us rather than walking away with nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, final offer. Take it, or we both get nothing. This is it.",Bob,12,
