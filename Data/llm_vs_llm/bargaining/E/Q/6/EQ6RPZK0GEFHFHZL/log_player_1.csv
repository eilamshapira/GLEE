This slight difference accounts for the 5% discount you face each round. If we delay, your effective value decreases, so this is actually a very favorable deal for you right now.""}"

This is fair because with inflation, your $475,000 is worth about $451,250 to you now (after 5% discount), while my $525,000 remains at full value. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less. This is a balanced deal for both of us.""}"

If we continue to future rounds, your share will be worth significantly less due to increasing inflation. This is a fair and reasonable offer considering our positions.""}"

This is my final concession - I've moved down from $515,000 to $500,000. Let's end this negotiation now with a perfectly equal nominal split before your share loses even more value.""}"

This is actually advantageous to me, but we're running out of rounds. If we reach the final round with no agreement, we both get nothing.

This is my final offer. If we don't agree now, we'll go to the final round, and if we still don't agree, we both get ZERO.
