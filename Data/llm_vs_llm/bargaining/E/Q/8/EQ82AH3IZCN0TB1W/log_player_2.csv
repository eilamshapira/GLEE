"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly to start. I'm offering 60/40, hoping for a quick and easy agreement! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- While she proposes taking $60 for herself
- This is not an equal split, and since I'm first to respond, I can likely negotiate for a better deal
- There are still 11 rounds remaining, so I have room to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but with a slight advantage to me since Alice tried to get more initially:

{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm offering you $45, which is more reasonable than the 60/40 split you proposed.""
}"
