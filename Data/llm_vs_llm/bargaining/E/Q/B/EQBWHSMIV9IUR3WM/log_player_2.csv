# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's better than her last offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor, pushing Alice to offer more."

This offer is finally reasonable given the time constraint and inflation. Accepting to secure a decent amount."
