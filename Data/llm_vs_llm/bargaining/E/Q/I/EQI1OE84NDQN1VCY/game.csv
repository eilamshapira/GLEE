500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, how about we split the money equally? You get $500000 and I get $500000. Let’s settle now to avoid the 5% inflation hit on my share. I believe this fair offer benefits us both—looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic, I'm taking a risk by waiting. I should be compensated for that. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? ",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the proposed split doesn't compensate me adequately for the risks I'm taking, especially given the inflation hit I face. I'm looking forward to negotiating further in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
390000.0,610000.0,"Bob, I understand risk is on your side, and while my share is swiftly diminishing due to inflation, I'd rather settle now than lose even more value. In light of your previous proposal, I'm offering you $610000 and taking $390000 for myself. This slight extra incentive for you should make settling now more attractive than waiting further. Let's conclude the deal this round.",Alice,3,
