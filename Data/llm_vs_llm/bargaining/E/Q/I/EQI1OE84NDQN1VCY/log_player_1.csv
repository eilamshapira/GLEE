"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, how about we split the money equally? You get $500,000 and I get $500,000. Let’s settle now to avoid the 5% inflation hit on my share. I believe this fair offer benefits us both—looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic, I'm taking a risk by waiting. I should be compensated for that. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the proposed split doesn't compensate me adequately for the risks I'm taking, especially given the inflation hit I face. I'm looking forward to negotiating further in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 390000, ""bob_gain"": 610000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand risk is on your side, and while my share is swiftly diminishing due to inflation, I'd rather settle now than lose even more value. In light of your previous proposal, I'm offering you $610,000 and taking $390,000 for myself. This slight extra incentive for you should make settling now more attractive than waiting further. Let's conclude the deal this round.""}"
