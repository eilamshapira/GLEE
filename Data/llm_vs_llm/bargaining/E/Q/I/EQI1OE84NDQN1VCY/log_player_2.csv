"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, how about we split the money equally? You get $500000 and I get $500000. Let’s settle now to avoid the 5% inflation hit on my share. I believe this fair offer benefits us both—looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

I'll reject Alice's offer. While an equal split seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal in a later round.  Alice's mention of inflation on *her* share makes me think she might be more susceptible to it than she's letting on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic, I'm taking a risk by waiting. I should be compensated for that. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? ""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand risk is on your side, and while my share is swiftly diminishing due to inflation, I'd rather settle now than lose even more value. In light of your previous proposal, I'm offering you $610000 and taking $390000 for myself. This slight extra incentive for you should make settling now more attractive than waiting further. Let's conclude the deal this round. 
# Bob gain: 610000 
# Alice gain: 390000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and has increased her offer to a level that's agreeable. Accepting now guarantees a good gain before inflation further erodes the value.  Taking a deal now is a better strategy than holding out for a potentially marginally better, but riskier deal later."
