"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will be affected by inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial amount. Given that inflation will reduce the value of money for me in future rounds, I believe this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
$45 × 0.8 = $36 effective value for me
$55 × 0.9 = $49.5 effective value for Bob

If I reject, we move to round 3 where my money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction). Also, Bob seems to be affected by lower inflation, which means waiting gives him an advantage.

While I'd prefer a higher share, this offer still gives me a reasonable amount, and waiting will only decrease my purchasing power further.
