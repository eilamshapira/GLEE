"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 5% value each round, this split actually gives you more value now than waiting. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less. This is a fair deal considering the depreciation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
