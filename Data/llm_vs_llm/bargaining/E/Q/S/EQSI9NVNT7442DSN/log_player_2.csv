"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate, I have some negotiating leverage. If we go to the next round:
- My $5000 would still be worth $5000
- Her $5000 would be worth $4750 (5% less)

This suggests I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, taking advantage of this depreciation pressure on her side.

However, there's also risk in rejecting a fair offer - we only have 12 rounds total and if we can't agree, we both get nothing.

Given this is the first round and I can make a counter-offer that factors in the depreciation, I'll reject this even split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the 5% depreciation Alice faces, while still being reasonable enough that she's likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 5% value each round, this split actually gives you more value now than waiting. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less. This is a fair deal considering the depreciation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but let's find a middle ground. This offer gives you more while still considering my loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5300, which is better than her initial 50-50 split
2. She's acknowledging the inflation impact on her side
3. If I reject:
   - We move to round 4
   - Her money will depreciate by another 5%
   - I could potentially get more, but she might become more resistant

This is a reasonable compromise that:
- Gives me more than the initial split
- Accounts for some of the inflation pressure
- Moves us closer to agreement before too many rounds pass

While I could potentially get more by continuing, there's also the risk of reaching no agreement if we push too hard. Given we're already in round 3 of 12, and this is a decent improvement from the initial offer, I'll accept.
