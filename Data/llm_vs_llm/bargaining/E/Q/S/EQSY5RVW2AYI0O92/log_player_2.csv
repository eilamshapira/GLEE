"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation kicks in 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer of a 60-40 split would give me $400,000, which is substantial, it's not an equal division. Since this is only the first round and inflation is just beginning to affect the total amount, I think I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal shares of $500,000 and can avoid further inflation reducing our total.""}"
