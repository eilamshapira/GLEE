"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation affecting me when making my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable split for myself (60/40). This gives me a better return upfront, considering the inflation that will affect subsequent rounds. I hope Bob finds this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the 20% inflation on my potential gains. Bob's offer is $45 for me and $55 for him.

Before inflation, $45 would have been worth $45. Now it's worth $45 * 0.8 = $36.

I'm going to reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I rejected Bob's offer. Now it's my turn to make a new offer, keeping in mind the 40% cumulative inflation (20% from round 1 and 20% from round 2).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Rationale: I'm increasing my share significantly because the money I receive now is worth only 60% of its original value. I need to compensate for the diminishing returns. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, understanding that further delays will only erode the value for both of us."
