0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob – I know time is money. Given that every extra round reduces my dollars by 10% while yours remain steady, if you wait for your turn you’ll get the full million. So, to avoid any delay (and my ensuing loss), I propose that you take the full $1000000 now and I receive nothing. I trust you’ll agree that there’s no gain in prolonging negotiations.",Alice,1,
