"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I know time is money. Given that every extra round reduces my dollars by 10% while yours remain steady, if you wait for your turn you’ll get the full million. So, to avoid any delay (and my ensuing loss), I propose that you take the full $1,000,000 now and I receive nothing. I trust you’ll agree that there’s no gain in prolonging negotiations.""}"
