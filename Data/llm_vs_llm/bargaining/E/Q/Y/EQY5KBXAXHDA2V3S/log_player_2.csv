"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I know time is money. Given that every extra round reduces my dollars by 10% while yours remain steady, if you wait for your turn you’ll get the full million. So, to avoid any delay (and my ensuing loss), I propose that you take the full $1000000 now and I receive nothing. I trust you’ll agree that there’s no gain in prolonging negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
