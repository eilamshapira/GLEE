"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a very unfair offer. Alice is proposing to take 95% of the total amount, leaving me with only 5%. Given the inflation effect, if I reject this offer, the total value will decrease by 20% in the next round. However, I believe I can propose a much more equitable split that would benefit both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that recognizes both our interests, especially considering the 20% inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is reasonable because I know I face 20% inflation per round, which significantly decreases the value of money for me if we continue negotiating. A fair split would account for this disadvantage that I face. This offer still provides Alice with a substantial $400,000, which is much more balanced than her initial proposal."
