450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I find your initial 90/10 split quite unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is fair considering I'm already taking a 20% inflation hit by rejecting your first offer. If you reject this, you'll face the same inflation penalty in the next round, making us both worse off. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Okay Bob, I see your point about fairness, and inflation is a pain. Let's split it 50/50 to make this end. This is the best we're going to get. Take it.",Alice,3,
