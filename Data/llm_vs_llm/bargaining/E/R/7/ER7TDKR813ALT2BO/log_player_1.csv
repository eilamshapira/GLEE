"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I find your initial 90/10 split quite unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is fair considering I'm already taking a 20% inflation hit by rejecting your first offer. If you reject this, you'll face the same inflation penalty in the next round, making us both worse off. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
