"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it, Bob. Time is money, and it's losing value by the second! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 10% of the total ($100,000), while keeping 90% ($900,000) for herself. This is quite an uneven split in her favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. However, I could potentially negotiate a much better split that would offset this loss.

Given the significant imbalance in Alice's proposal and the fact that I can make a counter-offer next round (even accounting for the 20% inflation), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I find your initial 90/10 split quite unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is fair considering I'm already taking a 20% inflation hit by rejecting your first offer. If you reject this, you'll face the same inflation penalty in the next round, making us both worse off. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I see your point about fairness, and inflation is a pain. Let's split it 50/50 to make this end. This is the best we're going to get. Take it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Alice is now proposing a 50/50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

Due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is worth 36% less than in the first round, making it equivalent to about $320,000 of the original value. Alice's share doesn't suffer from inflation according to the information provided.

This is actually a significant improvement over Alice's initial 90/10 split offer. While I could reject and make another counter-offer, the inflation would continue to erode my potential gains further (becoming 48.8% less than original value in the next round).

Given these considerations, accepting a 50/50 split now is likely the best option for me.
