"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for how we should divide the $10,000, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, since I face the 10% inflation penalty for each round we delay. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I need to secure a bit more now to offset the disadvantage I face if we keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
