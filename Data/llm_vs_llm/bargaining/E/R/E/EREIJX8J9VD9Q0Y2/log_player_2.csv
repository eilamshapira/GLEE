"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good amount before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically:

1. She's offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the total amount will be worth 20% less ($80 total)
   * My maximum potential gain in round 2 would be around $64 (if Alice accepts)

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the inflation penalty is significant. A guaranteed $40 now is better than risking further devaluation, and it's a reasonable offer even if not perfectly equal.
