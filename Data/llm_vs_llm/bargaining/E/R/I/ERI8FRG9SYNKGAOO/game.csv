450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I propose that I take $550000 and you take $450000. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation of money over rounds.",Bob,2,

475000.0,525000.0,I've adjusted my proposal to account for inflation. I'll take $475000 and you can take $525000. I believe this is fair given the circumstances.,Alice,3,

425000.0,575000.0,I still think the previous offers weren't quite fair considering the different inflation rates. How about I take $575000 and you take $425000? This should better account for the devaluation of money for both of us.,Bob,4,

450000.0,550000.0,Let's make sure we both benefit despite inflation. I'll take $450000 and you take $550000. It's a fair deal given the current devaluation rates.,Alice,5,
