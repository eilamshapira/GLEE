"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that accounts for Bob's time pressure due to the 10% depreciation per round, while still being fair to both parties.

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since waiting will cost you 10% of the value each round, this 40% share is better for you than getting a larger share later. Let's make a deal now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share since the value of money doesn't decrease for you, but I still want a larger portion. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This offer gives me $4500, which is $1500 less than my previous proposal
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, Bob's share will be worth 20% less to him
3. This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round, as Bob's incentive to settle increases
4. However, there's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer, and we could end up in a cycle of rejections

Given that I could likely get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's increasing time pressure, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less than in round 1, I'll propose a division that reflects this increased pressure while still being more attractive than continuing negotiations.

{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Your $3,500 now is worth more than $4,000+ after another round due to the 10% depreciation. This is your best option to maximize your real value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Even with depreciation, I believe I can get a better deal than your previous offer. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $4200, which is less than his previous offer of $4500
2. His $5800 share is actually worth only about $4228 to him (due to 27.1% depreciation)
3. If I reject, in the next round his share will be worth 34.4% less than round 1
4. This declining value gives me stronger negotiating position in the next round
5. Bob's reduced offer despite his weakening position suggests he might not be fully rational about the depreciation

Since my negotiating position gets stronger each round and Bob has actually decreased his offer to me, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's money now worth 34.4% less than in round 1, I'll make an offer that emphasizes the rapidly diminishing value of further negotiations for Bob.

{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Due to 34.4% depreciation, your $3,000 now is worth more than $5,800 in the next round. Further delays will only decrease your real value. This is your best opportunity to maximize your actual return.""
