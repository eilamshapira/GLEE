"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you made the first move, but considering the inflation effect, I think this split is more fair. Let's settle for this to avoid further loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that due to inflation, delaying further would reduce my gains. While I could try to negotiate for a better split, the 4800$ I get now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds where inflation will have eaten into the real value. This is a reasonable split that allows both of us to walk away with a substantial amount."
