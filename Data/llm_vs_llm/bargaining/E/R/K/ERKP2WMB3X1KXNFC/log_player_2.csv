Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2. Considering the devaluation, I need to factor that in.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""alice_gain"": 3500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm trying to get a better deal than Alice's previous offer, given the impending inflation.
*   I am taking into account that Alice also has inflation, but hers is less severe.
*   I am making this offer with the assumption that the game theory solution is for me to take the majority."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 4. Remember, the devaluation is hitting me hard!

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""alice_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   Inflation is making things tough. I need a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.
*   I'm still trying to get a reasonable amount, recognizing that Alice needs something to agree.
*   I am pushing for a better deal while it's still early in the game."
