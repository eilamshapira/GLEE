500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose an even split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. This fair division allows us both to secure a significant portion of the money right from the start and avoid any uncertainties or potential value loss in upcoming rounds. Let's make it simple and equitable.",Alice,1,
