"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to kick things off on a fair note. Given that waiting only erodes our pot further – especially for me – I propose an even split of $5000 each right away. This way we avoid any inflation losses and both come away with the full value of our shares. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
