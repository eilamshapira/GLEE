# Bob's message: Let's split the money in a way that reflects our respective inflation rates. This offer gives me a bit more, but still leaves you with a substantial share. Considering the decreasing value of the money, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

# Bob gain: 5500
