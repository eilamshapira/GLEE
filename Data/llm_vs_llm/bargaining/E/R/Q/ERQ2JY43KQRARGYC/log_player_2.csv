"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to split the money with a slight advantage to me to account for the inflation difference. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully. Given that the money will be worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I want to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now versus potentially getting a better deal later.

Considering Alice's offer, I would get $4800, which is less than half of the total amount. However, it's also important to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round.

For now, I think I can try to get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation factor, I want to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

I'll propose a split that gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Alice with a significant amount. This way, I'm trying to balance my own interests with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Alice to accept.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split the money in a way that reflects our respective inflation rates. This offer gives me a bit more, but still leaves you with a substantial share. Considering the decreasing value of the money, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer considers both of our inflation rates and ensures we both get a fair share. It's important to reach an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round, I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer.

Alice's offer gives me $5100, which is more than her initial offer, but still less than what I proposed in the previous round. However, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (19% less), I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now versus potentially getting a better deal later.

The fact that Alice is willing to ""meet in the middle"" suggests that she's trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Additionally, her message emphasizes the importance of reaching an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation, which is a valid concern.

Taking all this into account, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer and put an end to the game.
