"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
3. However, I'll get to make the next proposal
4. $400,000 now is better than $450,000 in the next round (which would be worth $405,000 due to inflation)
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable offer considering:
- I avoid the 10% inflation penalty
- I get a guaranteed substantial amount
- Future negotiations might not lead to a better outcome
