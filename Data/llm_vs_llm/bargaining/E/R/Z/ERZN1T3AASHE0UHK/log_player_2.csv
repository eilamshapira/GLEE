"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I take 600k and you take 400k. This way we're both getting a fair portion, considering my funds devalue with each round. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 2 your funds will lose an extra 20% in real value, while mine remain unaffected. To avoid further loss on your side, I propose we agree now: I take $999,999 and you receive $1. This offer is strictly better for you than waiting for a round where your bargaining power—and your effective funds—deteriorate further. I hope you see the wisdom in settling immediately.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your strategy, but let’s strike a fairer deal this round. I propose a 40/60 split: I receive 400k and you get 600k. This acknowledges your stronger position, but also respects my need for a reasonable share. Let's agree and end the game here! 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, in round 4 your money is now worth only about 51.2% of its round 1 value. If you reject my offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5, but you'll face even steeper depreciation and I, being fully patient, can extract nearly the entire pie. To avoid further losses, I’m offering you a token $1—an immediate value of about $0.512 in round 1 terms—which is at least as good as your expected outcome if you delay. I'd advise you to accept this offer now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, at this stage, I'm offering a 25/75 split: I take 250k and you get 750k. Considering the depreciation in my funds, this is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your patience while still allowing me to retain a meaningful portion. Let's finalize the deal on this fair note. 
# Bob gain: 750000 
# Alice gain: 250000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer you'll be the proposer in round 7, but the further devaluation will mean that every dollar you secure then is worth only about 0.8 times its current round 6 value. In round 7 your effective value would drop to roughly $262,144 in round-1 terms, even if you could claim almost the whole pie nominally. To avoid that additional loss, I’m offering you $800,000 nominal in round 6 (which, at the current discount factor of 0.32768, equals approximately $262,144 in round-1 value), while I take $200,000. I believe this offer matches your best expected outcome if you wait and is in both our interests to conclude the deal now.""}"
