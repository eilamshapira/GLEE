60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both benefit.,Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing $100 total, a 50-50 split seems most fair to start. If you accept now, you get $50 with only 5% inflation from one round. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce your value more with each round.",Bob,2,
