Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing $100 total, a 50-50 split seems most fair to start. If you accept now, you get $50 with only 5% inflation from one round. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce your value more with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because Bob makes a valid point. While I'd prefer a larger share to offset inflation, accepting $50 now with only 5% inflation (meaning I effectively get $47.50 in round 1 value) is better than risking further rounds where inflation will continue to erode my share. If we continued negotiating, I might end up with less real value due to compounding inflation effects, even if I got a nominally larger amount."
