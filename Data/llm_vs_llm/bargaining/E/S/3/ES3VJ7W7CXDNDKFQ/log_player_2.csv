"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60, arguing this is fair because she faces 5% inflation per round while I face 0% inflation.

While it's true she faces inflation, we're still dividing $100 total, and I have the option to make a counter-offer in the next round. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can safely move to the next round without losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges Alice's inflation concern but aims for a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, but since we're dividing $100 total, a 50-50 split seems most fair to start. If you accept now, you get $50 with only 5% inflation from one round. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce your value more with each round.""}"
