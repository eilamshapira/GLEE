"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split it 50/50.
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value to me (100% - 36% = 64%). 

Alice's offer of $4200 is equivalent to $4200 / 0.64 = $6562.5 in the original value. 

Since this is more than half of the original $10,000, I accept the offer.
