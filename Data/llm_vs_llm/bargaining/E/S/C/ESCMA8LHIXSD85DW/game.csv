600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's go 50/50 this round, considering inflation and the time we're spending. Fair, right?",Bob,2,
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I feel my initial offer was more reflective of the value decrease for both of us. Let's try 55% for me and 45% for you this round. What do you say?",Alice,2,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, considering the rapid decrease in value, I'm adjusting my offer to 57.5% for me and 42.5% for you. This should be more equitable given our different rates of inflation. Let's settle this soon!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alright Alice, let's try this one. I'm slightly increasing my share to reflect the continued inflation impact on my gains. Let's close the deal!",Bob,4,
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I see your point, but I believe my offer from last round was more balanced considering our inflation rates. Let's go with 55% for me and 45% for you this round. We need to reach an agreement soon!",Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, with the value decreasing rapidly, I'm proposing 56% for me and 44% for you. This should be fair given our different inflation rates. Let's finalize this soon before it's too late!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
465000.0,535000.0,"Alice, this is a tough game. I'm increasing my share a bit more. Let's end this now, or the pie will shrink even more.",Bob,6,
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand the urgency, but I believe 55% for me and 45% for you is still a fair split given our inflation rates. Let's agree on this before the value drops further!",Alice,6,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. I'm sticking with 56% for me and 44% for you. This is a fair compromise considering our inflation rates. Let's end this now before it's too late!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, last chance! Taking a slightly bigger slice, and we finish here. Let's do it!",Bob,8,
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm not willing to accept less than 55% given our inflation rates. Let's agree on 55% for me and 45% for you. We're running out of time!",Alice,8,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire. I'm proposing 56% for me and 44% for you. This is our last chance to reach a fair deal before the money loses too much value. Let's agree now!",Alice,9,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I can't accept less than 55% given our inflation rates. This is my final offer: 55% for me and 45% for you. We need to settle this now!",Alice,10,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, this is our second to last round. I'm sticking with 56% for me and 44% for you. It's now or neverâ€”let's agree before we lose everything!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, this is the last round. My final offer.",Bob,12,
