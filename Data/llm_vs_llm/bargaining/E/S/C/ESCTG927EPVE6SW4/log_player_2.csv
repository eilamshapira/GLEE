"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair, splitting the $10000 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She proposes an even 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. The offer appears fair and reasonable
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice might propose a less favorable split in the next round
5. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
