"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation aspect. Since Bob loses 5% of value each round, there's an incentive for him to accept sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair offer that acknowledges the time pressure you face due to inflation. If we go to another round, the total value will be worth less to you, so this deal is advantageous now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is trying to gain a larger share despite facing inflation pressure. Let me adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing while still maintaining a fair advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering you $48, which is the same amount you offered me, but this offer is more valuable to you now than waiting for another round due to the 5% inflation you face. If we continue to the next round, your $48 would effectively be worth about $45.60 to you. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I can see that we're having difficulty reaching an agreement. Let me consider the inflation effects more carefully and make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This is fair in absolute terms, and actually advantageous for you considering the inflation you're facing. If we go to round 6, your $50 would effectively be worth only about $42.75 to you due to the compounding 5% inflation (nearly 15% at this point). A 50-50 split now is better for both of us than continuing this negotiation further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now several rounds into this negotiation, and Bob is facing significant inflation of over 22%. Let me make a more strategic offer that recognizes this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering you $52, which is a better deal for you than what you just offered me. Due to inflation, if we continue to round 8, the value of money will decrease even further for you. At this point, your inflation is around 22.62%, meaning this $52 is much more valuable to you now than a potentially larger amount in future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that favors both of us completing the deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 60
