"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers both our needs and the inflation effect that Bob faces.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. Since you face 10% inflation per round while I don't, accepting this offer now gives you more value than waiting for later rounds."
