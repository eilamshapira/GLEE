"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and simple, 50/50 split. We both walk away with 500k, no hassle, and no inflation worries. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split where we each get $500,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me. That means the full $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. 

A 50/50 split now gives me $500,000, while even if I managed to get more in the next round, the inflation would eat into my gains. For example, even if I got $600,000 in round 2, with 5% inflation that would be equivalent to $570,000 of current value.

Given the uncertainty of future negotiations and the guaranteed loss from inflation, this seems like a reasonable offer.
