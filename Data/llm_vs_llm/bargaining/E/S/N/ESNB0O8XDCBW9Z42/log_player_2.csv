"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether I should accept Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her, or reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me. So if I propose a better split for myself next time, I need to factor in this 5% inflation.

$45 now is better than having to propose something like $50 next round, because after 5% inflation, $50 would effectively be worth $47.50 to me. Plus, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer.

Given the limited number of rounds and the inflation effect, this first offer is actually quite reasonable.
