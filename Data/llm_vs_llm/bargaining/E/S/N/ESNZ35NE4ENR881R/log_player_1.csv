"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, the total value will decrease by 20% next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to offer you the same deal you offered me, but with us reversing roles.  It seems fair considering we both lose out if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept, I get $450,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $360,000 to me
* If I reject, we go to the next round where:
  - I can make a new offer
  - But any money I get will be worth another 20% less (worth only 64% of original value)
  - The next best offer I could realistically expect would be worth even less than $360,000 to me due to inflation
