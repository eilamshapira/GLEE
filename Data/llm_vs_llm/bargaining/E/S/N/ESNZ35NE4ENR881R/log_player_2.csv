"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, the total value will decrease by 20% next round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to gamble that she's more concerned about inflation than she's letting on. By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to wait for a better deal. There's a chance the pot decreases in value, but there's also a chance I can secure a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to offer you the same deal you offered me, but with us reversing roles.  It seems fair considering we both lose out if this drags on.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm mirroring Alice's offer to signal fairness, but I'm also applying pressure. By taking the ""loss"" in round 2 (if she accepts), I demonstrate that I'm serious about maximizing my share and not afraid to wait. This might make her more willing to accept a less favorable offer in a potential round 3."
