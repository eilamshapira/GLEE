"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, money loses 10% value for me and 5% for Alice
3. In next round, I can make a counter-offer
4. After depreciation:
   - My $400,000 now vs. my future offer with 10% less value
   - I'd need to secure significantly more to make up for the 10% loss

Since this is a substantial amount ($400,000) and any delay would cost me 10% of whatever I eventually get, I'll accept. While I could try for more, the risk of value loss is too high.
