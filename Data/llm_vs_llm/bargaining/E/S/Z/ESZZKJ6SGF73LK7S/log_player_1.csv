"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a fair starting offer that gives me a slight advantage but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease by 10% for me in the next round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Since we're in round 2:
- If I accept this offer, I'll get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4050 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than the original value
- Bob's proposal is essentially a mirror of my first offer, but slightly worse for me due to inflation

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the increasing inflation penalty makes this risky. Each round of rejection will cost me more value, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer.
