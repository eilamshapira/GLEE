"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains and need to account for the different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's fair enough to likely be accepted while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects, the next round will have the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for him, which would be disadvantageous for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $50, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $45
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any future gains will be worth even less (20% less in the next round)
- Bob's offer is equal split, which is fairly reasonable
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to compounding inflation

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now than risk further rounds.
