"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
- If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
- However, with inflation, any delay means the money is worth less
- A fair split now is better than an uncertain outcome later
