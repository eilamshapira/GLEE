"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the inflation penalties. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair split that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial amount. I'm offering Bob 40% of the total, which is better than risking a 20% loss in value if he declines and we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept:
- I get $4000 at 95% value = $3800 effective value
- Bob gets $6000 at 80% value = $4800 effective value

If I reject and make a new offer next round:
- The money will be worth another 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob
- That significantly weakens our negotiating positions
- Further delays might lead to even worse outcomes for both

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, it's still a reasonable amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. The effective values show that despite Bob getting more nominal dollars, the actual value difference isn't as large due to his higher inflation penalty.
