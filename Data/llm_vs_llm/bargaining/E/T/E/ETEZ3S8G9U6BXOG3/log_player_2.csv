Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation concerns, so I'll offer $5500 to you and take $4500 for myself. This way, you still get a larger share, and we both benefit more given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable. While I would prefer my 62/38 split, the longer this goes on, the more we both lose to inflation. Accepting a 55/45 split now is better than risking an even lower offer (from Alice's perspective) in later rounds."
