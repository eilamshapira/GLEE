"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
