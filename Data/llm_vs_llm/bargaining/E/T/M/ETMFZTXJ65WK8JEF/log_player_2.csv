"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. The offer is fairly close to a 50-50 split (45%-55%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further depreciation
4. The current value for me is $450,000, but if I wait one round, even getting $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me due to the 20% depreciation

Given the significant depreciation rate for me (20%) compared to Alice's (5%), and the relatively fair initial offer, it would be risky to reject this.
