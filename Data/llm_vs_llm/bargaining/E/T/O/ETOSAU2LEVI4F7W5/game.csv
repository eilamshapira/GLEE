6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round, taking this deal now is better than waiting - you'd need more than $4400 next round just to match this offer's value.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is fair. Even with the 10% inflation affecting me, this is still better for both of us than dragging this out. We both benefit from resolving this quickly, and an even split respects both our interests.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your desire for fairness, but consider that after two rounds of inflation, $4500 now is actually worth more to you than $5000 was in round 2. This 55-45 split is a fair compromise, and waiting longer will only reduce the real value of your share due to inflation.",Alice,3,
