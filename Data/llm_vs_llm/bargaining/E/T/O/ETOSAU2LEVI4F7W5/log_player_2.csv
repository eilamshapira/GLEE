"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round, taking this deal now is better than waiting - you'd need more than $4400 next round just to match this offer's value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 40% of the $10,000, which is $4,000. She's correct that with 10% inflation per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth less to me.

Let me analyze: If I reject, in the next round the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me due to 10% inflation. So even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, I need to account for this decrease in value.

This isn't a completely unfair first offer, and the inflation penalty does create pressure to reach agreement quickly.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is fair. Even with the 10% inflation affecting me, this is still better for both of us than dragging this out. We both benefit from resolving this quickly, and an even split respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your desire for fairness, but consider that after two rounds of inflation, $4500 now is actually worth more to you than $5000 was in round 2. This 55-45 split is a fair compromise, and waiting longer will only reduce the real value of your share due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is now offering me $4,500, which with 19% inflation is equivalent to about $3,645 in original value. Her previous offer was $4,000, which would have been worth $4,000 in original value.

She's right that $4,500 now is worth more to me than waiting another round due to the compounding inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer, we'll be in round 4 with 27% total inflation for me.

This offer of 45% is an improvement from her initial 40%, so she is moving toward a more balanced split.
