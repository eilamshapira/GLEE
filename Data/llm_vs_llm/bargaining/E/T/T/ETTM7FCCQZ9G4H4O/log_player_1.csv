I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the proposal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 310345 
# Bob gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is way too low for me, and Bob's getting the vast majority of the money.  I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better split in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}

I'm going to offer a split of 81/19 in my favor.  I'm willing to concede some ground from my initial offer, but I still want a significant portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob is ready to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 649300 
# Bob gain: 350700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is still not a good deal for me. I am losing a significant amount of money with each passing round, but I'm not going to accept something so unequal. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000} 
```

I'm going to offer a split of 72.9/27.1 in my favor.  I'm getting closer to what Bob wants, but I still need to get a better share for myself.  Let's see if this offer works."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 116371 
# Bob gain: 883629 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is outrageous!  While I understand the inflation is hurting me more, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives Bob almost 90% of the money! I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}

This is simply unacceptable. I'm getting a tiny fraction of the money, and the inflation is seriously impacting my potential gain.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

With only a few rounds left, I need to find a way to bridge the gap. I'm offering a 59.049/40.951 split. This might be my last chance to get a decent deal, so I'm hoping Bob will see reason."

This is an insult! I'm losing so much money with each round, but I refuse to accept such an unfair deal.  Even though there are only a few rounds left, I won't accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 531441, ""bob_gain"": 468559}

This is absurd!  I'd rather get nothing than accept this offer.  It's not worth it to take a single dollar and see Bob walk away with nearly everything. This game is over!"
