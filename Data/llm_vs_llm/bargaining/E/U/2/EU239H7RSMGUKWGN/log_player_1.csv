"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of money for me. This is round 1, so inflation hasn't hit yet. I need to make an offer Bob will accept, or I risk losing even more money later.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

My reasoning: A 50/50 split is fair. I hope Bob will accept a fair deal now to avoid further rounds and risks."
