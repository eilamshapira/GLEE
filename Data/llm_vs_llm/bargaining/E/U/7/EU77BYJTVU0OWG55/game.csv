55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I propose we split the money $55 for me and $45 for you. This is fair considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, I'll lose value quickly while you might not. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,Hi Alice! I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. Let's ensure we both get something substantial before inflation starts to impact our gains more significantly.,Bob,2,
