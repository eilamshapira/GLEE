"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose we split the money $55 for me and $45 for you. This is fair considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, I'll lose value quickly while you might not. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. Let's ensure we both get something substantial before inflation starts to impact our gains more significantly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
