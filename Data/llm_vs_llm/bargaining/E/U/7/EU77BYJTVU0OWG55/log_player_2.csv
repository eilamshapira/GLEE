"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose we split the money $55 for me and $45 for you. This is fair considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, I'll lose value quickly while you might not. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
