"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation for me, next round the money will be worth less
4. For me: $400,000 now vs. potential for more but at 95% value
5. If Alice is rational, she might reject an offer that's worse for her, and her inflation rate is higher (10%)
6. This is a decent first offer - I get 40% of the total

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential future rejections makes this offer reasonable enough.
