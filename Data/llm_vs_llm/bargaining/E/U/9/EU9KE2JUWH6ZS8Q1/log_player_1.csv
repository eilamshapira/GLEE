Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation is working against me. It's better to try and secure a larger portion of the money earlier in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200} 

**Reasoning:**

I am reducing my demand slightly to make the offer more appealing to Bob, but still aiming for a larger share considering the inflation working against me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more even split, this offer is still not advantageous considering the inflation is hitting my potential gains harder than his."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous offer. It's becoming clear that Bob is aiming for a near even split, but with the inflation disparity, time is on his side, not mine. I need to remain firm."
