100000.0,900000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $100000 and you receive $900000. Accepting this offer right away gives you the full $900000 value, whereas waiting to make your own proposal next round means your share will be discounted by 10% and mine by 20%. Let’s avoid the loss from delay and agree immediately.",Alice,1,

50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, I understand your previous offer, but I believe a more balanced division is fair. I propose I receive $950000 and you receive $50000. Considering the devaluation, this offer still provides you with a reasonable amount. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to offer a balanced split, but the deal leaves me with an effective value of only $40000, which is far too low given our potential outcome in future rounds. I believe waiting one more round will allow for a proposal that’s more favorable for both of us. Let’s continue the negotiations.",Alice,2,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose we settle now: I take $100000 and you get $900000. With the inflation this round, my share is worth 0.64 × $100000 ≈ $64000 and yours 0.81 × $900000 ≈ $729000. If you were to wait until Round 4 to propose, you'd essentially be able to secure roughly the same effective value, but with even more delay. To avoid further devaluation and secure our outcomes, I believe it’s best to agree on this split now. Let’s end the game on a rational note—please accept.",Alice,3,

90000.0,910000.0,"Alice, considering the devaluation, I propose I receive $910000 and you receive $90000. This round, your share is worth approximately 0.64 × $90000 ≈ $57600, and mine is worth approximately 0.729 × $910000 ≈ $663590. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not convinced by the valuation on my side. With your offer of $90000 nominally (effectively about $46080 at this round’s discount), I believe that holding out for the next round—where I’ll have the opportunity to propose—gives me the chance to secure a better share. Let's continue negotiating in hopes of finding a more balanced split.",Alice,4,reject
97000.0,903000.0,"Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $97000 and you receive $903000. At this stage, my nominal share is discounted by a factor of 0.4096 (i.e. 0.8^4) and yours by 0.6561 (0.9^4). That gives you an effective value of roughly 903000 × 0.6561 ≈ $592000. Considering that if you reject and wait until Round 6—when you'll propose—the additional round’s devaluation would likely leave you with an effective value in the same ballpark, this offer should be at least as good as your continuation value. I believe this split helps us both avoid further losses from inflation. I look forward to settling this matter now.",Alice,5,
