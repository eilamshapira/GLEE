"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I receive $100,000 and you receive $900,000. Accepting this offer right away gives you the full $900,000 value, whereas waiting to make your own proposal next round means your share will be discounted by 10% and mine by 20%. Let’s avoid the loss from delay and agree immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous offer, but I believe a more balanced division is fair. I propose I receive $950000 and you receive $50000. Considering the devaluation, this offer still provides you with a reasonable amount. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to offer a balanced split, but the deal leaves me with an effective value of only $40,000, which is far too low given our potential outcome in future rounds. I believe waiting one more round will allow for a proposal that’s more favorable for both of us. Let’s continue the negotiations.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 3 I propose we settle now: I take $100,000 and you get $900,000. With the inflation this round, my share is worth 0.64 × $100,000 ≈ $64,000 and yours 0.81 × $900,000 ≈ $729,000. If you were to wait until Round 4 to propose, you'd essentially be able to secure roughly the same effective value, but with even more delay. To avoid further devaluation and secure our outcomes, I believe it’s best to agree on this split now. Let’s end the game on a rational note—please accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the devaluation, I propose I receive $910000 and you receive $90000. This round, your share is worth approximately 0.64 × $90000 ≈ $57600, and mine is worth approximately 0.729 × $910000 ≈ $663590. Let's settle this round to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 90000 
# Bob gain: 910000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not convinced by the valuation on my side. With your offer of $90,000 nominally (effectively about $46,080 at this round’s discount), I believe that holding out for the next round—where I’ll have the opportunity to propose—gives me the chance to secure a better share. Let's continue negotiating in hopes of finding a more balanced split.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 97000, ""bob_gain"": 903000, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $97,000 and you receive $903,000. At this stage, my nominal share is discounted by a factor of 0.4096 (i.e. 0.8^4) and yours by 0.6561 (0.9^4). That gives you an effective value of roughly 903,000 × 0.6561 ≈ $592,000. Considering that if you reject and wait until Round 6—when you'll propose—the additional round’s devaluation would likely leave you with an effective value in the same ballpark, this offer should be at least as good as your continuation value. I believe this split helps us both avoid further losses from inflation. I look forward to settling this matter now.""}"
