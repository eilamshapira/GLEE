"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds. While I want a good outcome for myself, I also want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because:
1. It's a reasonable split that gives both parties a substantial amount
2. If Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation
3. It shows I'm willing to be fair while maintaining a slight advantage as the first mover"
