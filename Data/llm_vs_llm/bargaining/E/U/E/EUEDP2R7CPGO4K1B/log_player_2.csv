"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
* If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
* My $450,000 would become worth $405,000 if I wait
* To get a better deal, Alice would need to offer me significantly more to overcome the 10% loss
* This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
* Waiting risks further depreciation and potential failure to reach agreement
