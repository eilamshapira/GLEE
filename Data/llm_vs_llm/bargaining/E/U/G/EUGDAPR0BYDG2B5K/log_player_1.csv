"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 45/55 split? A bit more for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $550,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $550,000 * 0.9 = $495,000.

Considering this, I think I can do better. My initial offer was $600,000 for myself, which is more than the effective value of Bob's offer.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate the effective value, I'll multiply the amount I propose to take by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation).

Let's aim for a split that gives me a higher effective value than Bob's previous offer. I'll propose a 65/35 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""My turn again! 65/35, let's move forward!""
}
```

This offer gives me $650,000, which has an effective value of $650,000 * 0.8 = $520,000 due to the 20% inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
