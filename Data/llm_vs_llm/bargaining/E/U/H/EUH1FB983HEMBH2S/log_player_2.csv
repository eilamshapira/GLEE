"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, which is a significant amount, it's less than half of the total. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in round 2, though the total will be worth 10% less (so $9000 total value). I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that still acknowledges the 10% inflation that has occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and considering we've already lost 10% of the value due to inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to lose value in future rounds."
