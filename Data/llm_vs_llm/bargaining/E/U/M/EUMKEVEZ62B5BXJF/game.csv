513000.0,487000.0,"Hi Bob, let's make a deal now to avoid further losses from inflation. Based on our shared discount factor of 0.95 and the fact that I’m proposing this round, the equitable split works out roughly to 51% for me and 49% for you. In nominal terms, that's about $513000 for me and $487000 for you. I believe this proposal reflects the fair, rational outcome given our remaining rounds. Looking forward to settling and preserving value for both of us!",Alice,3,

I propose 52% for me and 48% for you. This should account for the discount factor and our negotiating positions. Let's finalize the deal before the value drops further!",Bob,4,
