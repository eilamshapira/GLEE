Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe a more even split is in order. Considering the 5% devaluation, I'm willing to take 55% and offer you 45%. This way, we both benefit from the current value. Let's make the most of it!

In nominal terms, that's about $513,000 for me and $487,000 for you. I believe this proposal reflects the fair, rational outcome given our remaining rounds.
