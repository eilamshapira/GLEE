Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 now—$600000 for me and $400000 for you. Given the 5% devaluation in each round, accepting today maximizes our returns, and I'm confident that this offer serves both our interests. Let's not let time erode the total pot!

# Alice gain: 600000

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe a more even split is in order. Considering the 5% devaluation, I'm willing to take 55% and offer you 45%. This way, we both benefit from the current value. Let's make the most of it!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make a deal now to avoid further losses from inflation. Based on our shared discount factor of 0.95 and the fact that I’m proposing this round, the equitable split works out roughly to 51% for me and 49% for you. In nominal terms, that's about $513000 for me and $487000 for you. I believe this proposal reflects the fair, rational outcome given our remaining rounds. Looking forward to settling and preserving value for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 487000 
# Alice gain: 513000

I propose 52% for me and 48% for you. This should account for the discount factor and our negotiating positions. Let's finalize the deal before the value drops further!""}"
