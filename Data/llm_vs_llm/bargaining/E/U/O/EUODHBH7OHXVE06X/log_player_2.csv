"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

- Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
- So $100 in the next round will effectively be worth $90 to me
- That means to get more than the current $40 offer, I'd need to secure more than $44.44 in the next round ($44.44 * 0.9 = $40)
- Given that Alice's money will depreciate by 20% next round, I might have some negotiating leverage

However, $40 is still a decent offer and there's risk in rejecting. I'll accept.
