"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. $300,000 now is better than potentially getting $400,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $320,000 to me due to inflation)
4. Alice's inflation rate is only 5%, so she has less pressure to make a quick deal
5. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, getting a decent offer in round 1 might be better than risking future rounds

While the split isn't equal, $300,000 is a significant amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. I'll accept this offer.
