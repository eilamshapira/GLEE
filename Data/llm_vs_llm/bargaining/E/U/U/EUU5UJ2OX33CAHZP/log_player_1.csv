"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the 20% inflation penalty per round. I should aim for a fair split that Bob would accept to avoid inflation eroding the value, but also recognize that this is a negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40. Since we face 20% inflation each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This split acknowledges your power to reject but offers you a substantial portion."
