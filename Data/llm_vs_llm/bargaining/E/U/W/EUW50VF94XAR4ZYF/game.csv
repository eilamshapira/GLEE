550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! How about a fair split where I take $550000 and you get $450000? This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, since we both face inflation but you face a higher rate (20% vs my 10%), we should conclude this quickly. I'm proposing a slight adjustment where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we both still walk away with substantial amounts. Let's finalize this now before our money loses more value.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the inflation rates make this tricky. Let's aim for a compromise. I'll take $520000 and you $480000. This split acknowledges the differential inflation impact while also bringing us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",Alice,3,
