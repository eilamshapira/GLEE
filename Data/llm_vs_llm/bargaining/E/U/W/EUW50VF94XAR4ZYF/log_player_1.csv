"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face inflation but you face a higher rate (20% vs my 10%), we should conclude this quickly. I'm proposing a slight adjustment where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we both still walk away with substantial amounts. Let's finalize this now before our money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
