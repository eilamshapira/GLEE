"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the asymmetric inflation rates while still being attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Given that inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%), this slightly higher portion for me helps balance the time pressure I face. I believe this is a fair division that respects both of our interests."
