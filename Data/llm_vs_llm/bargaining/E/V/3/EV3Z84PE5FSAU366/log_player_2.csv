"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'm Bob. Let's analyze this offer. Alice is offering me $45, and keeping $55 for herself.

Since this is the first round, I need to consider the potential cost of rejecting this offer. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, and I'll have to make a counter-offer.

$45 is not a great offer, but it's not terrible either. I need to think about how likely I am to get a better offer from Alice in later rounds if I reject this. There's a possibility that Alice will offer me even less later on, knowing the effects of inflation.

Given the circumstances, I will accept this offer.
