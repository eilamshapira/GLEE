90.0,10.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose $90 for me and $10 for you. Given the inflation hitting my share as rounds progress, it's in our mutual interest to agree now. What do you say?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to find a middle ground, but I won't accept an offer as low as $10. Considering inflation, let's settle on 60-40 and call it a day.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob, I recognize that waiting further only hurts both of usâ€”my share in particular is losing value faster. To settle things now, I propose a division of $45 for me and $55 for you. This offer gives you a slightly better outcome than my previous proposal while still improving my position relative to your last offer. Let's agree now and avoid any more loss due to inflation.",Alice,3,
