"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose $90 for me and $10 for you. Given the inflation hitting my share as rounds progress, it's in our mutual interest to agree now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to find a middle ground, but I won't accept an offer as low as $10. Considering inflation, let's settle on 60-40 and call it a day.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I recognize that waiting further only hurts both of usâ€”my share in particular is losing value faster. To settle things now, I propose a division of $45 for me and $55 for you. This offer gives you a slightly better outcome than my previous proposal while still improving my position relative to your last offer. Let's agree now and avoid any more loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
