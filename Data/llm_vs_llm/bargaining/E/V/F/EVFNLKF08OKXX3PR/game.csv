6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that waiting will cost you more than it costs me due to higher inflation on your side.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. While I'm willing to compromise, I believe this reflects the higher inflation rate you'll face if we continue this game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Due to the 10% inflation rate you face, this 4200 is now worth only 3780 to you. If you reject, the next round will reduce your value even more. This is your best opportunity to secure a good outcome.",Alice,3,
