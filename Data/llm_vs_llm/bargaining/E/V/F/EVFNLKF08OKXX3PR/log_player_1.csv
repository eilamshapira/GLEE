"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that waiting will cost you more than it costs me due to higher inflation on your side.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. While I'm willing to compromise, I believe this reflects the higher inflation rate you'll face if we continue this game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With my 5% inflation rate, $4500 now is worth $4275 to me. I can make a better offer in the next round that Bob might accept given his higher inflation rate. Even if we go back and forth a few times, I can likely secure a better outcome since Bob's money loses value faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200,
