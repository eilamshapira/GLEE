Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% inflation rate you face, this 4200 is now worth only 3780 to you. If you reject, the next round will reduce your value even more. This is your best opportunity to secure a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
