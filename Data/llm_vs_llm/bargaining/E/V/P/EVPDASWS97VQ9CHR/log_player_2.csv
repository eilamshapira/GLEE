"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $45, which is less than half of the total $100. While my first instinct might be to reject and make a counter-offer, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the maximum value I could get would be $95. If I proposed a 50-50 split then, I'd get $47.50 in value.

Since $45 is close to what I could reasonably expect after accounting for inflation in the next round, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, I'll accept this offer.
