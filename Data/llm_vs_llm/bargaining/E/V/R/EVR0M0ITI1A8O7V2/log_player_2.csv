"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

With 10% inflation per round, if I reject now, the next round's value will be worth 10% less for me. So if I propose a 50-50 split next round (500k each), it would actually be worth 450k to me due to inflation.

The current offer of 400k is better than what I could reasonably expect to get after inflation in the next round, even if I make a more favorable proposal. Additionally, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value lost to inflation.

Therefore, I'll accept this offer.
