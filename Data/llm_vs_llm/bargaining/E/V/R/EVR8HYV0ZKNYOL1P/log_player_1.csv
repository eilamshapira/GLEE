"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair initial split, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while taking into account that if Bob rejects, the total value will decrease by 20% for me in the next round."
