"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and the game continues to another round, there will be a 5% reduction in the value for me due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could potentially get more than $40. However, with 5% inflation, even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd effectively get $47.50 (50 Ã— 0.95) in current value terms.

While Alice's offer isn't equal, rejecting it means risking further devaluation. I think it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than face the guaranteed 5% loss.
