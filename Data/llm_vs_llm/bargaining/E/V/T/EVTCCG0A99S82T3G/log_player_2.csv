"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $40 for me
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less for me
   * Maximum I could propose would be worth $80 (but devalued by 20%)
   * Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further devaluation

Alice's offer isn't terrible, and the inflation risk is significant. If I reject, even if I propose a better split next round, I'll only get 80% value of whatever amount we agree on.

$40 now is better than risking a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.
