"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing $100.

Looking at our situation, I need to consider that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects Bob (10% per round). This means I have a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger portion at $55 while I take $45. This is a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation asymmetry between us. Since delay hurts me more than it hurts Bob, I'm willing to offer him a bit more to secure an agreement now rather than risk greater losses in future rounds."
