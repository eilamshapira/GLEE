"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So if I were to get more than 50 in the next round, I'd need to get at least 52.63 (50 รท 0.95) to break even compared to accepting 50 now.

Since a 50-50 split is objectively fair and there's a guaranteed loss of value for me if we continue to the next round, I should accept this offer.
