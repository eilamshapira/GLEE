"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing I get $4,000 (40%) and she gets $6,000 (60%)
- This is the first round, so no inflation effect yet
- If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
- The split seems a bit unfair in her favor
- There are still many rounds left to negotiate

I'll reject this offer since I believe we can reach a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since she started with an offer in her favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I suggest a more balanced split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is fairer than your initial proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  50/50 is the fairest way to go. We both get an equal share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's share is actually worth 19% less to her (around $4,050 in original value terms)
3. My share maintains its full value at $5,000
4. This is actually a better deal for me than it appears on the surface, since I'm not affected by inflation
5. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and in this case, I'm actually getting more value due to the inflation effect on Alice's side

Given these factors, this is a good offer for me, and continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes.
