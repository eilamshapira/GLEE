"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer to Bob. Since inflation doesn't affect me but reduces Bob's value by 20% each round, I have an advantage in later rounds. This means Bob should be more willing to accept reasonable offers now rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $4,000, Bob. This is a fair offer considering that if we delay agreement, the money will be worth less to you in future rounds due to inflation, while its value doesn't decrease for me."
