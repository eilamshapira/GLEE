"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000. Due to the 20% inflation per round that only affects me, if I reject this offer, any future money will be worth less to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, my $1 will be worth $0.80. In round 3, it would be worth $0.64, and so on.

While I could ask for more, the inflation penalty puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds. $4000 now is better than potentially getting nothing or a depreciated amount later.

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer.
