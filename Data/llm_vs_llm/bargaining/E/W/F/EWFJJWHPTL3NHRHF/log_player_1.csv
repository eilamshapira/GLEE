"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal that acknowledges both our interests and the impact of inflation on my position.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a fair split that gives me a slight advantage to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we need another round. This balanced approach should be acceptable to both of us, allowing us to conclude the negotiation efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
