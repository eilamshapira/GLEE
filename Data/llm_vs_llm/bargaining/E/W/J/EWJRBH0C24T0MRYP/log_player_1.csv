"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you still get the majority. At this point, the money is already worth 20% less to me, so this is fair. If we continue to another round, I'll lose even more value, but you'll also receive less in absolute terms. This is a win-win offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
