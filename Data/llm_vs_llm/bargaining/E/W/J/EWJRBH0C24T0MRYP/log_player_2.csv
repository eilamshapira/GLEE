"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm taking the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount. Think about your future! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $1,000 out of $10,000, which is only 10% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money would be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total value for me would be $8,000 equivalent. However, I would then get to make my own proposal.

Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that could potentially give me more than $1,000, even after the 20% devaluation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering the time pressure I'm under.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you still get the majority. At this point, the money is already worth 20% less to me, so this is fair. If we continue to another round, I'll lose even more value, but you'll also receive less in absolute terms. This is a win-win offer.""}"
