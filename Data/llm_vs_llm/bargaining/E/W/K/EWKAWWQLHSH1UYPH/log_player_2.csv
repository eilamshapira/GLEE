"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting $40 now is better than rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round, where the total money would be worth 10% less to me.

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $90 to me in the next round. If I then proposed a 50-50 split, I'd get $45, which is better than the $40 I'm being offered now. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that Alice started with a somewhat uneven split favoring herself, I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to offer a 55-45 split in my favor. Since I'm experiencing 10% inflation per round, this compensates somewhat for the delay while still giving Alice a fair portion. This is a reasonable middle ground that gives us both a substantial share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I now know that Alice is also experiencing inflation, and at a higher rate than I am (36% vs 19% for me by round 3). 

If I accept this offer, I get $50 which is worth $50 Ã— 0.81 = $40.50 to me in original value terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation for me will increase, and any future money will be worth even less. Alice has moved from her initial 40-60 split to a 50-50 split, which is a fair improvement.

Given the progressive inflation and the fair even split being offered, I'll accept this offer.
