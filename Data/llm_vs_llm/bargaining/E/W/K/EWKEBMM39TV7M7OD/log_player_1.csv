"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation each round and I don't, waiting is costlier for you. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than $5000 would be after several more rounds of inflation. Let's close this deal now so you don't lose value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,

  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm willing to accept a bit less than an even split. This offer gives you more than half, but it's still fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further for me.""
