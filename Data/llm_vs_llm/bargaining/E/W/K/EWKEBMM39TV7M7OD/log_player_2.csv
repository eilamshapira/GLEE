"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation aspect of this game.

For me (Bob), the money doesn't lose value over rounds (0% inflation).
For Alice, the money loses 20% value each round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice will face a 20% devaluation of whatever amount she gets. This gives me negotiating leverage as the game progresses.

While the equal split might seem fair, I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal, knowing that Alice has more incentive to accept sooner rather than later due to her inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation Alice faces. Since the money loses 20% value for Alice each round but not for me, I have leverage. I'll propose a split that's still reasonable but more favorable to me, explaining my reasoning to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation each round and I don't, waiting is costlier for you. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than $5000 would be after several more rounds of inflation. Let's close this deal now so you don't lose value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm willing to accept a bit less than an even split. This offer gives you more than half, but it's still fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further for me. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is now offering me $5,500 while taking $4,500. This is a 55-45 split in my favor, which is better than her initial 50-50 offer. She's acknowledging the inflation impact on her side.

If I reject:
- In the next round, her money would be worth 49% less than the first round
- I could potentially negotiate for more
- However, there's also the risk she might offer less favorable terms if frustrated

Given that:
1. This is a reasonable improvement from her initial offer
2. I'm now getting the majority share (55%)
3. We've already used 3 of our 12 rounds
4. The offer is close to what I proposed in the previous round (60-40)

I think this is a reasonable compromise.
