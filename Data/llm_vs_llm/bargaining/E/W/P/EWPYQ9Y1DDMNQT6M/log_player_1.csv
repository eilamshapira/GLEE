"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I should make a fair but strategic first offer, considering that the money will be worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a good portion while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob refuses, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me, so I have incentive to make a compelling first offer
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or antagonistic"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $480,000
2. Due to 10% inflation for me, this $480,000 is actually worth $432,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than round 1 value
4. If I got $600,000 in round 3, it would be worth $480,000 in round 1 terms

Given that:
- The current offer ($432,000 in round 1 value) is significantly less than my initial proposal
- But waiting another round will mean even more value loss due to inflation
- There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer in round 3
- The split is not extremely unfair

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, so I'll accept this offer despite it being lower than my initial proposal."
