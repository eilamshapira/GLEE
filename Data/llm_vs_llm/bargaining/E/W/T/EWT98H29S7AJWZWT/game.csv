6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, consider the inflation rates carefully. Your money loses value 4 times faster than mine (20% vs 5%). A delay hurts you much more than me. This split is actually favorable for you when considering the rapidly declining value of future rounds.",Alice,3,

5500.0,4500.0,"Understanding the inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to 4500$ for me and 5500$ for you. This way, you still gain more, but it's more balanced considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
