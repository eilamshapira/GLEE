"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally at 5000$ each. It's the most straightforward and fair solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The equal split seems fair on the surface, but since my inflation rate (5%) is much lower than Bob's (20%), I can get a better deal by waiting. Bob should be more willing to give me a larger share since his money loses value faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, consider the inflation rates carefully. Your money loses value 4 times faster than mine (20% vs 5%). A delay hurts you much more than me. This split is actually favorable for you when considering the rapidly declining value of future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Understanding the inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to 4500$ for me and 5500$ for you. This way, you still gain more, but it's more balanced considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation rates and the risk of further delays. With the current inflation impact, this split gives me a good portion while avoiding the risk of further value degradation for both parties. Bob has shown understanding of the inflation dynamics and made a fair adjustment in my favor."
