"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split that favors me slightly. You'll lose more value than me if we delay, so this is a good deal for both of us.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider the inflation rates carefully. Your money loses value 4 times faster than mine (20% vs 5%). A delay hurts you much more than me. This split is actually favorable for you when considering the rapidly declining value of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500
