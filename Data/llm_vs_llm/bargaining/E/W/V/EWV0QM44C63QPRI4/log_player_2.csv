""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I see you're playing hardball. Fine. I'm offering a 65/35 split. This is the best you'll get from me, given the circumstances. Take it, or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation.  I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are getting close to the deadline. This is a 50/50 split. Consider it a friendly compromise at this stage. Accept it before we lose it all. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as fair as it's going to get, especially with the increasing inflation.  A 50/50 split is a good deal at this stage."
