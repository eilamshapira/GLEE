"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my gains in future rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me, which means we both lose. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Prolonging this only diminishes the value, hurting us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
