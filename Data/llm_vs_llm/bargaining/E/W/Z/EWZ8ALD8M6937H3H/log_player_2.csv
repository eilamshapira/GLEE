Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me, which means we both lose. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
