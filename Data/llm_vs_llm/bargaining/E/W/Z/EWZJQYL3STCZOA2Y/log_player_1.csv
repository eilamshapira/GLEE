"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, and that it is now my turn to make the proposal in the next round if I reject, I must consider what I could gain if I propose again. I should accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
