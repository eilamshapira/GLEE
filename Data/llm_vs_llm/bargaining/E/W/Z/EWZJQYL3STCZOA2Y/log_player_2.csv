"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me).

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and propose a better split next round, I'd need to get more than $421,053 (which is equivalent to $400,000 now after accounting for 5% inflation) to make rejecting worthwhile.

Since I can make a counter-offer that's likely to be better than this, and the inflation penalty for one round isn't too severe, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but also accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is the fairest division possible and gives us both an equal share of $500,000. This is significantly better for me than Alice's initial offer, and represents a balanced approach to dividing the funds."
