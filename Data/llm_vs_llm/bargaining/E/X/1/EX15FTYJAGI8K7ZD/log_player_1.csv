"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this division where I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, making it more likely to be accepted and allowing us to conclude the deal quickly."
