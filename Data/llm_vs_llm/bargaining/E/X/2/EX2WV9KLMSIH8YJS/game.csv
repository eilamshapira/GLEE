6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me less. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging the differing impacts of inflation on us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
9500.0,500.0,"Alice, I understand that in future rounds the inflation works more in your favor. However, as we wait, my share loses value at a steeper rate. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all of the pot—roughly a nominal $10000 that, after a 5% discount, gives you about $9025 in effective value. With this proposal, you're receiving $9500 nominally (i.e. about $9025+ in effective terms), avoiding further unnecessary depreciation. Please accept this division so we both lock in the best possible present values without more loss.",Bob,2,

9500.0,500.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, given the rules, this is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's settle this round to avoid further depreciation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
9510.0,490.0,"Alice, as we move into round 4 the depreciation hits us harder—my share is now worth only about 73% and yours about 86% of the nominal amounts. If we delay, you'll be the proposer in round 5 and, though that gives you control, the further discount will likely leave you around an effective $8145. With this proposal, you get nominal $9510, which at current rates works out to roughly $8150 in present value—just a bit above your expected value if you wait. I believe this split fairly reflects the cost of further delay for both of us, and I urge you to accept so we both preserve as much value as possible.",Bob,4,

9520.0,480.0,"Bob, given the increasing impact of inflation, this offer ensures that we both get a reasonable share while minimizing further losses. Let's settle this round to avoid additional depreciation.",Alice,5,

9530.0,470.0,"Alice, with each passing round our money loses value even faster. At round 6, my share is now worth about 59% of the nominal and yours about 77%. If you wait until round 7 as the proposer, you might secure nearly the whole pot—but that pot will be discounted to roughly 73.5% of its face value, about $7350 effectively. By accepting my offer today, you'll get roughly $7373 in effective value (9530 × 0.7738), which is a slight improvement over waiting. I believe this split fairly reflects the current cost of delay for both of us. Please settle now and avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
