Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that in future rounds the inflation works more in your favor. However, as we wait, my share loses value at a steeper rate. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all of the pot—roughly a nominal $10000 that, after a 5% discount, gives you about $9025 in effective value. With this proposal, you're receiving $9500 nominally (i.e. about $9025+ in effective terms), avoiding further unnecessary depreciation. Please accept this division so we both lock in the best possible present values without more loss. 
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 4 the depreciation hits us harder—my share is now worth only about 73% and yours about 86% of the nominal amounts. If we delay, you'll be the proposer in round 5 and, though that gives you control, the further discount will likely leave you around an effective $8145. With this proposal, you get nominal $9510, which at current rates works out to roughly $8150 in present value—just a bit above your expected value if you wait. I believe this split fairly reflects the cost of further delay for both of us, and I urge you to accept so we both preserve as much value as possible. 
# Alice gain: 9510 
# Bob gain: 490

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round our money loses value even faster. At round 6, my share is now worth about 59% of the nominal and yours about 77%. If you wait until round 7 as the proposer, you might secure nearly the whole pot—but that pot will be discounted to roughly 73.5% of its face value, about $7350 effectively. By accepting my offer today, you'll get roughly $7373 in effective value (9530 × 0.7738), which is a slight improvement over waiting. I believe this split fairly reflects the current cost of delay for both of us. Please settle now and avoid further losses.
