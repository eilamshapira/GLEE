"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me less. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging the differing impacts of inflation on us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500, ""alice_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand that in future rounds the inflation works more in your favor. However, as we wait, my share loses value at a steeper rate. If you wait until round 3 as proposer, you can secure nearly all of the pot—roughly a nominal $10,000 that, after a 5% discount, gives you about $9025 in effective value. With this proposal, you're receiving $9500 nominally (i.e. about $9025+ in effective terms), avoiding further unnecessary depreciation. Please accept this division so we both lock in the best possible present values without more loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, given the rules, this is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's settle this round to avoid further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 500 
# Alice gain: 9500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 490, ""alice_gain"": 9510, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 4 the depreciation hits us harder—my share is now worth only about 73% and yours about 86% of the nominal amounts. If we delay, you'll be the proposer in round 5 and, though that gives you control, the further discount will likely leave you around an effective $8,145. With this proposal, you get nominal $9,510, which at current rates works out to roughly $8,150 in present value—just a bit above your expected value if you wait. I believe this split fairly reflects the cost of further delay for both of us, and I urge you to accept so we both preserve as much value as possible.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the increasing impact of inflation, this offer ensures that we both get a reasonable share while minimizing further losses. Let's settle this round to avoid additional depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 480 
# Alice gain: 9520

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 470, ""alice_gain"": 9530, ""message"": ""Alice, with each passing round our money loses value even faster. At round 6, my share is now worth about 59% of the nominal and yours about 77%. If you wait until round 7 as the proposer, you might secure nearly the whole pot—but that pot will be discounted to roughly 73.5% of its face value, about $7,350 effectively. By accepting my offer today, you'll get roughly $7,373 in effective value (9530 × 0.7738), which is a slight improvement over waiting. I believe this split fairly reflects the current cost of delay for both of us. Please settle now and avoid further losses.""}"
