Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, considering I'm taking the risk of waiting another round. Let's see if you'll accept. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 512500,
""bob_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  I've adjusted my offer to account for some of the inflation risk. This deal gets us both a fair share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Bob's offer was heavily skewed in his favor. By slightly increasing my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my own position. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the need for a fair and swift resolution.  The longer this goes on, the less favorable the situation becomes for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I think I can get a better deal. This offer reflects my increasing risk of waiting further. Let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly. Waiting any longer is too risky.
* **Shift in Bob's Position:**  Bob's offer, while still favoring him, has moved closer to my original proposal. This suggests he's feeling the pressure too.
* **Avoiding a Worse Outcome:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will propose even less favorable terms in the next round, putting me in a weaker position."
