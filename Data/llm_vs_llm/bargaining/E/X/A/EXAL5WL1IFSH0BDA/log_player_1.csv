Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split almost evenly. I believe this is a good starting point for a fruitful negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we couldn't agree on an even split last round, I propose a slight shift in my favor to account for the inflation we're facing. Let's settle this quickly before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. This back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}"
