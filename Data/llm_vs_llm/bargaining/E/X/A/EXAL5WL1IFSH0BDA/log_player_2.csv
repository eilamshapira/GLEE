"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Since we couldn't agree on an even split last round, I propose a slight shift in my favor to account for the inflation we're facing. Let's settle this quickly before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
