Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was more than fair. Let's settle this now, I'll take a small cut and you get $45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is unlikely to offer me anything better. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller payout for me due to inflation."
