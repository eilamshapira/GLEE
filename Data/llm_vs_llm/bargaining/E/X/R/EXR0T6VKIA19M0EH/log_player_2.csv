Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, considering the inflation:

The initial amount is $1,000,000.

*   **My Inflation:** 5% reduction for Bob. So, my share is now worth 95% of its face value.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** 20% reduction for Alice. So, her share is now worth 80% of its face value.

I will aim for a proposal that gives me a slightly better position, as the longer the game goes on, the more the value of the money changes.

Here's the offer:
```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 4.

*   **My Inflation:** The money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. So, my share is now worth ~90.25% of its face value.
*   **Alice's Inflation:** The money is worth 36% less than in the first round. So, her share is now worth 64% of its face value.

I need to factor in that the value of my share is decreasing more slowly than Alice's, but that the value of both of our shares is decreasing. I will propose to split it fairly.
