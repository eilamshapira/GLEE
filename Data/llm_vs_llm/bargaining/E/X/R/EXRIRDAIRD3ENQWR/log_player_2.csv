"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's the best for both of us considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. With a 5% depreciation rate for me and 10% for Alice per round, waiting means the total value decreases for both of us.

2. The 50-50 split ($5000 each) is fair, but since Alice has a higher depreciation rate (10% vs my 5%), I might have more leverage in future rounds.

3. If I reject, next round I can propose, but the total value will be worth less for both of us. For me, $5000 now is better than $5250 (55% of $9500) next round.

4. There's also the risk of not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds, resulting in both getting nothing.

Given these factors, while I might have some negotiating advantage due to the different depreciation rates, the 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable, and the risk of depreciation makes it worthwhile to accept now.
