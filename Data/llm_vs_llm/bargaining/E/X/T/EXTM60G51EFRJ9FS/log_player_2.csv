"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though it's not an equal split, accepting this offer in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds due to inflation.  Getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting $320,000 (80% of $400,000) or less in the next round."
