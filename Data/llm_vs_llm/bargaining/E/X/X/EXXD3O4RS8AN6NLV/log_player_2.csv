"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start equally and see where it goes from here. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems fair, proposing an equal split of the $1,000,000. Since there's no inflation for me, I'm not losing value by taking this deal now. While I could potentially negotiate for more in a subsequent round, there's also risk in rejection as Alice might offer less favorable terms later.
