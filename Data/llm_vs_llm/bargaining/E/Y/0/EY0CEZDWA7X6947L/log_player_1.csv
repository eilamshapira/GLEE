"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation: I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, giving myself $6000 and Bob $4000. I am aware of the inflation, so I want to front-load my gain. This seems like a relatively fair initial offer that Bob might accept, avoiding the risk of further inflation eroding my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** If I accept, I get $3000. However, due to inflation, this $3000 is worth 10% less than it would have been in Round 1. Therefore, it's effectively worth $3000 * 0.9 = $2700 in Round 1 dollars.

*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob gets $7000, which is the same value it would have been in Round 1.

Given the inflation, Bob is getting a much better deal here. I'm better off rejecting and hoping to get a better offer in the next round, even if it's further devalued.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The stakes are higher now with another round of inflation. My money is now worth 20% less than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

Reasoning:

I'm asking for $7500. This $7500 is worth $7500 * 0.8 = $6000 in Round 1 dollars. Given the inflation, I need to ask for a higher nominal amount to get the same value. I'm betting that Bob is still unaware of my inflation concerns or that he is losing money faster than I am. I'm also aware that the game could go on forever. I'm hoping he accepts a smaller share to end the negotiation. This is a gamble, but I need to try and claw back some value given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **My perspective:** If I accept, I get $7000. Due to inflation, this $7000 is worth 27.1% less than it would have been in Round 1. Therefore, it's effectively worth $7000 * (1 - 0.271) = $7000 * 0.729 = $5103 in Round 1 dollars.

*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob gets $3000, which is the same value it would have been in Round 1.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting a smaller share than he previously asked for, I should accept this offer. Getting $5103 in Round 1 equivalent dollars is a reasonable outcome, and the risk of further inflation outweighs the potential gain from rejecting.
