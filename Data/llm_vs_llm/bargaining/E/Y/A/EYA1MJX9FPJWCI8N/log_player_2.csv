Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","This is interesting. While 80 seems high, the inflation is hitting me hard. I need to think strategically. Let's calculate the real value for me: 80 * (1 - 0.5904) = 80 * 0.4096 = 32.768

I'll accept, as it seems like a reasonable deal considering the circumstances.

""decision"": ""accept""
