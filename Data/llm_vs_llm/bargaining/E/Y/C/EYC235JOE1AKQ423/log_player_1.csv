"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 26.49, ""bob_gain"": 73.51, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $26.49 and you get $73.51. Think about it this way: if you reject and get to propose in Round 2, the pie will be the same $100 but because of inflation your money will be worth 5% less; in equilibrium you’d end up with about $77.38 nominal in Round 2 which is effectively only about $73.51 to you today. So accepting my offer now secures you the best possible value. Let’s settle now rather than lose value in later rounds.""}"
