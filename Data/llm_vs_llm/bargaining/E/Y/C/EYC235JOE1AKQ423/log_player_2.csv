"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $26.49 and you get $73.51. Think about it this way: if you reject and get to propose in Round 2, the pie will be the same $100 but because of inflation your money will be worth 5% less; in equilibrium you’d end up with about $77.38 nominal in Round 2 which is effectively only about $73.51 to you today. So accepting my offer now secures you the best possible value. Let’s settle now rather than lose value in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 73.51 
# Alice gain: 26.49 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
