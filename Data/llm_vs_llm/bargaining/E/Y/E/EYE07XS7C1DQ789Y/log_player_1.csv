"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 71.43, ""bob_gain"": 28.57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 1: I propose we split the $100 so that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Waiting means that each extra round chops value—my money loses 10% and yours 20% per round. In Round 2 you’d be the proposer, but the effective amount you’d get would be discounted by 20%, roughly leaving you with the same value as $28.57 today. Accepting now avoids further loss from inflation for both of us. I hope you agree this is a fair solution for both parties.""}"
