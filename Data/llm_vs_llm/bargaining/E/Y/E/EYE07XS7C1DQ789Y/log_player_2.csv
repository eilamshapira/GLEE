"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 1: I propose we split the $100 so that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Waiting means that each extra round chops value—my money loses 10% and yours 20% per round. In Round 2 you’d be the proposer, but the effective amount you’d get would be discounted by 20%, roughly leaving you with the same value as $28.57 today. Accepting now avoids further loss from inflation for both of us. I hope you agree this is a fair solution for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation rates.

If I reject this offer, we go to Round 2 where:
- The $100 is worth 20% less to me ($100 × 0.8 = $80 effective value)
- The $100 is worth 10% less to Alice ($100 × 0.9 = $90 effective value)

Alice's offer gives me $28.57 now, which is about 28.6% of the current value.

If I make a counterproposal in Round 2, I would need to consider both our inflation rates. Even if I proposed a better split for myself in Round 2, Alice might reject it, leading to more rounds and more inflation.

Given the severe 20% inflation penalty I face each round compared to Alice's 10%, I'm inclined to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
