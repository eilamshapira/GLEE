"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. While I get less than half, I should consider the effect of inflation. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, and I'd need to make a counter-offer.

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $95 to me in the next round. If I were to get a 50-50 split then, I'd receive $47.50 in effective value. This is better than the $40 I'm being offered now.

I think I should reject and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation factor while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a slightly better deal for myself at 52-48, which I think is fair. Since Alice offered me 40% in the first round, offering her 48% should seem like a reasonable improvement from her perspective. This split gives me more than what I would effectively get if we continued to the next round with inflation, and also gives Alice a decent portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation rates.

Alice has now revealed that she's facing a much higher inflation rate (36%) than I am (9.75%). This is important information.

If I accept this offer, I get $45, which after my 9.75% inflation is worth about $40.61 in original round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my inflation will increase further, and any amount I might get would be worth even less. Given Alice's high inflation rate, she's likely motivated to reach an agreement soon.

The offer of $45 is better than Alice's first offer of $40, and considering the inflation effect, this is a reasonable improvement. If I reject, I risk further devaluation of my potential gains.
