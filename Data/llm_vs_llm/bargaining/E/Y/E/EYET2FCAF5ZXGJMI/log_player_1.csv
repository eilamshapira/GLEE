"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer that takes into account that I face steeper inflation penalties than Bob. Since waiting will hurt me more than him, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a fair split considering I face higher inflation risk in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $44
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 40% less for me and 10% less for Bob
- My original offer of $60 would only be worth $36 in the next round
- Bob's current offer of $55 (worth $44 to me now) is better than what I could reasonably expect to get in future rounds given the severe inflation penalty I face
