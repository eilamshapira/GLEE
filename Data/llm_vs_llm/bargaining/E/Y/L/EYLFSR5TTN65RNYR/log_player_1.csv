"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. A 55-45 split in my favor. Remember, the money loses value with each passing round. This is a better deal for you than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. With 10% inflation, my $4500 is now worth $4050
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, my next gain would be devalued by 20%
3. Further negotiation could lead to even worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
4. This is a reasonable split, close to 50-50"
