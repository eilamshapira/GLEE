"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that any delay will reduce the value for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because I want to offer a reasonable deal that Bob is likely to accept, avoiding the 5% inflation penalty I would incur if we move to another round. While I'm taking a slightly larger share, the difference is not so extreme that it should trigger an automatic rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth another 5% less for me
   * I'm not guaranteed Bob will accept my next offer
   * Further delays could lead to even more value loss

While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the effective value I'm receiving is still significant, and the risk of further inflation makes accepting this offer the more prudent choice.
