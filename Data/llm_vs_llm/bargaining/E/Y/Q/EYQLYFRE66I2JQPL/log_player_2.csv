"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer. Alice is proposing to give me $400,000 and keep $600,000 for herself.

I need to consider inflation effects. If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
- For Alice, it will only be worth 5% less

This means the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round, while still being worth $950,000 to Alice.

If I make a counter-offer, I could potentially get more than $400,000, but I need to propose something Alice would accept given her better inflation position.

Given the significant inflation disadvantage I face, and that $400,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
