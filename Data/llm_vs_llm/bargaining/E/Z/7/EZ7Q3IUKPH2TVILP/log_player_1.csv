"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the inflation risk we both face. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer considering we both lose value if we continue negotiating, with Bob losing more each round."
