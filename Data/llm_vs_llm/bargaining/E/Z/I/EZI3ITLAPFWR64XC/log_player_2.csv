"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me 400,000$ (40%) while keeping 600,000$ (60%) for herself. 

While this is a substantial amount, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I would get to make the next proposal. Additionally, studies on the ultimatum game suggest that offers closer to 50-50 are more common and considered more fair.

Since I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this somewhat uneven split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice had initially proposed an uneven split. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more equitable than the previous 60-40 split while giving me a small advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice a fair $450,000 while keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a more balanced distribution that should be more appealing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting - Alice has now proposed almost exactly what I proposed, but with the amounts reversed (she gets 550k, I get 450k). This is actually a quite reasonable offer, giving me 45% of the total amount. While it's slightly less than what I proposed, considering:

1. The offer is still fairly balanced
2. If I reject, we'll continue negotiating and risk losing time/value
3. $450,000 is a significant improvement from the initial $400,000 offer
4. Further negotiation might not yield significantly better results

I'll accept this offer.
