"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which means $5,000 for each of us. However, I need to account for the inflation effect - if I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me in the next round.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the $10,000 would be worth only $9,000 to me due to inflation. Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I'd be dividing a smaller pie from my perspective.

A fair even split in the first round seems reasonable, especially considering the inflation penalty for delaying.
