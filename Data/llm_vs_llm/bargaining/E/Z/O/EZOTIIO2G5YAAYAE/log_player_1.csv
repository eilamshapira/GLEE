"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, where each of us gets $5,000. This is an equitable division that respects both of our interests. I'm aware that inflation affects my gains with each passing round, so I believe this fair split in the first round is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
