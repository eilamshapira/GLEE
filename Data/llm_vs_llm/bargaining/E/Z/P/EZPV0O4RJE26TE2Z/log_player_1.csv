"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that accounts for Bob's time pressure due to the 20% inflation penalty per round. I'll offer a fair split but one that encourages immediate acceptance.

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a reasonable split that favors us both concluding now, considering you face 20% depreciation each round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it avoids further depreciation for me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The fact that Bob faces 20% depreciation per round gives me more bargaining power. If we go to the next round, I can offer Bob less and it would still be rational for him to accept since his share will be worth even less to him then. I'll make a more advantageous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now that Bob has faced two rounds of depreciation, his position is weaker. I'll make an offer that reflects this but still gives him enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round of depreciation.

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given the 40% depreciation you've already faced, this offer of $4000 is worth more to you than waiting another round where you'd face 60% total depreciation. Let's conclude now.""
}"
