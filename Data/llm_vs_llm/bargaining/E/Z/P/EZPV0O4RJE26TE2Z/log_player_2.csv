"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a reasonable split that favors us both concluding now, considering you face 20% depreciation each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it avoids further depreciation for me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the 40% depreciation you've already faced, this offer of $4000 is worth more to you than waiting another round where you'd face 60% total depreciation. Let's conclude now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
