**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's in my best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Shift in Offer:** Alice's offer has shifted closer to a more even split. This suggests she's feeling the pressure of the dwindling pot.  I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal."
