"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects me more, I think it's fair to split it this way. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The total amount is now worth less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less, so the total value is 10000 * 0.95 = 9500.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so the total value is 10000 * 0.9 = 9000.

Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 4500 (actual value: 4500 * 0.95 = 4275)
Bob gain: 5500 (actual value: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950)

I think I can do better than this. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

The total amount is now worth even less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less in each round, so the total value is 10000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 9025.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so the total value is 10000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 8100.

My offer:
{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, considering the inflation affects you more, but I also need a fair share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: To be fair and considering the inflation impact on both of us, let's split it equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The total amount is now worth less due to inflation:
For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less in each round, so the total value is 10000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 8573.75, which is approximately 14.26% less than the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so the total value is 10000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 7290, which is approximately 27.1% less than the original value.

Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 5000 (actual value: 5000 * 0.857375 = 4286.88)
Bob gain: 5000 (actual value: 5000 * 0.729 = 3645)

Given the significant impact of inflation on both of us, an equal split might be reasonable. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
