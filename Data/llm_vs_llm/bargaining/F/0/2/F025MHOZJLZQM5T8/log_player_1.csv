"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $100 with Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I want to propose a split that Bob is likely to accept to avoid further rounds and inflation erosion of my potential gains. I will start with a generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has made an offer. Let's analyze this from my perspective.

*   **Bob's Offer:** $40 for me, $60 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less than in round 1.

So, getting $40 now is equivalent to $40 * 0.8 = $32 in round 1 terms.

I need to weigh this against the risk of rejecting and facing even more inflation in the next round, where I would have to make a proposal again. Given that the total number of rounds is limited and inflation is eating into my potential profits quickly, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
