"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer would give me $40, but if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round would be worth less to me. If I reject, the $100 total would effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round.

Even if I counter with a more favorable split in round 2, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation. The 40-60 split isn't ideal, but it's reasonable enough given the inflation pressure, and securing $40 now is better than risking further devaluation.
