"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject this offer, I'll be able to make my own proposal next round. The downside is that inflation will reduce the value by 5%, so the $100 total will effectively be worth $95 to me next round.

If I accept now:
- I get $50 immediately
- No inflation loss

If I reject:
- I can propose next round
- But my share will be worth 5% less
- Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further inflation losses

Given that this is a very fair initial offer and inflation will eat into future values, I should accept this proposal.
