"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice. 
While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider:
1. If I reject, my next round's money will be worth 20% less due to inflation
2. We only have 12 rounds, and prolonging could lead to both of us getting nothing
3. $400,000 is still a substantial amount

If I reject, any future amount would need to be at least $500,000 to make up for the 20% inflation loss on $400,000.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable first proposal, and the risk of inflation eating into future gains is significant.
