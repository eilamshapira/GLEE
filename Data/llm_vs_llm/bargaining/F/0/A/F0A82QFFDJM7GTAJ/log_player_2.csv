I need to push Alice for a better deal. While the money is losing value, accepting a deal significantly worse than her first offer is not a good strategy."

This is still a bad deal for me.  I need to signal that I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share."

This is my final offer of a fair split. It signals I'd rather have us both get nothing than accept a heavily disadvantaged deal."
