"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, he has an incentive to accept earlier rather than later. I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too extreme.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. This is a fair offer considering that any delay will reduce the value of your share by 20% each round.""
