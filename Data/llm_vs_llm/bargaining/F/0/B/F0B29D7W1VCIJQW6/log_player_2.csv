"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split. This is a fair offer considering that any delay will reduce the value of your share by 20% each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I take $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she gets $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be affected by the 20% inflation penalty, meaning the total value to me would be worth only $800,000. If I asked for 50% in the next round, that would be $400,000 (the same amount Alice is offering me now).

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty puts me at a disadvantage with each passing round. Alice's offer actually preserves my value rather than risking losses through extended negotiations.
