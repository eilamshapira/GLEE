468559.0,531441.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $531441 and I’d keep $468559. This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect if you waited another round (after a 10% devaluation), so let’s agree now and avoid further loss for you.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering I'm the one facing the devaluation.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe waiting will work better for me. I reject your 60/40 split. In the next round I'll be making a proposal where I’ll offer you only the minimum you’d require given the further devaluation. I’d prefer to see us reach an agreement on terms that are more balanced, so I’m opting for another round.",Alice,2,reject
0.0,1000000.0,"Bob, in round 3 I must match your continuation value. If you reject now, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure almost the whole $1000000 – which at your 10% discount still gives you $900000 in real value. To make you at least as well off as waiting, I have to offer you the entire amount nominally now. I’m offering you $1000000 and taking nothing for myself. I know it’s not ideal for me, but it’s the only way to ensure you’re as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle now.",Alice,3,
