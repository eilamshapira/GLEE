"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 468559, ""bob_gain"": 531441, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $531,441 and I’d keep $468,559. This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect if you waited another round (after a 10% devaluation), so let’s agree now and avoid further loss for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering I'm the one facing the devaluation.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe waiting will work better for me. I reject your 60/40 split. In the next round I'll be making a proposal where I’ll offer you only the minimum you’d require given the further devaluation. I’d prefer to see us reach an agreement on terms that are more balanced, so I’m opting for another round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 3 I must match your continuation value. If you reject now, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure almost the whole $1,000,000 – which at your 10% discount still gives you $900,000 in real value. To make you at least as well off as waiting, I have to offer you the entire amount nominally now. I’m offering you $1,000,000 and taking nothing for myself. I know it’s not ideal for me, but it’s the only way to ensure you’re as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle now.""}"
