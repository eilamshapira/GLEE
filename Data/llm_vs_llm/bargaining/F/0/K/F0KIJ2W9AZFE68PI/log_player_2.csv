"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $531441 and I’d keep $468559. This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect if you waited another round (after a 10% devaluation), so let’s agree now and avoid further loss for you. 
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is designed to make me think I'm not losing anything by accepting immediately. However, I'm in a stronger position in this early stage. While the threat of devaluation is real, I can propose a more balanced split in the next round and still likely secure a better outcome than Alice's current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering I'm the one facing the devaluation.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, in round 3 I must match your continuation value. If you reject now, you’ll be the proposer in round 4 and can secure almost the whole $1000000 – which at your 10% discount still gives you $900000 in real value. To make you at least as well off as waiting, I have to offer you the entire amount nominally now. I’m offering you $1000000 and taking nothing for myself. I know it’s not ideal for me, but it’s the only way to ensure you’re as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle now. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is an incredibly generous offer, even after accounting for the devaluation. Alice is essentially giving me everything to avoid risking getting nothing herself. While it seems too good to be true, logically, it makes sense for her in this situation.  I'd be foolish to reject this offer."
