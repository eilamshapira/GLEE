"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk further devaluation of his share. While a 50-50 split might seem fairest, our different inflation rates make time more costly for Bob, so I believe this is a balanced first offer."
