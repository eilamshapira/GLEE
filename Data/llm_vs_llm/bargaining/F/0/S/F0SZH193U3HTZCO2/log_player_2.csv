"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the full $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me. So even if I got all $10,000 next round (which is unlikely), it would be worth less than getting $4,500 now.

Since this is a reasonable first offer and rejecting it would significantly reduce the value of any future arrangement due to my higher inflation rate, I'll accept.
