"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me since I'm affected more by inflation (20% vs 10% per round). I'll offer a fair but advantageous division.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives us both a substantial amount while accounting for my higher inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* My $50 is now worth $40 (20% less)
* Bob's $50 is worth $45 (10% less)
* If I reject, we go to round 3 where values will decrease even more
* Since I'm affected more by inflation, delays hurt me more than Bob

While I would have preferred a better split, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating. A 50-50 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation.
