"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm going first and there's inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while accounting for the fact that if Bob rejects and we go to later rounds, my share will be worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation factor means this 45$ is actually worth only 42.75$ to me. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round that Bob might accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, I need to account for the fact that my money is worth 10% less than the initial value. I'll try to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

With 10% inflation, my 60$ would actually be worth 54$ to me, which is still better than accepting Bob's previous offer. I hope Bob will see this as reasonable since we're both losing value by continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 14.26% inflation, the $40 would only be worth about $34.30 to me. This is too low, and I believe I can still make a better offer in the next round that Bob might accept. We still have several rounds left, though the inflation is becoming a serious concern."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation now at about 19% for me, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll increase my nominal amount to compensate for inflation while still trying to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

With 19% inflation, my $65 would be worth about $52.65 to me, which is still better than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer as further delays are especially costly for me, and we're already halfway through our rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 22.62% inflation, the $35 would only be worth about $27.08 to me. Even though we're running out of rounds and the inflation is getting worse, this offer is too low. I'll make another proposal in the next round that hopefully provides a better outcome for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation now at about 27% for me, and only a few rounds remaining, I need to make a compelling offer while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

With 27% inflation, my $70 would be worth about $51.10 to me. This might seem aggressive, but I need the higher nominal amount to compensate for the severe inflation impact. Bob still gets $30, and we're both better off reaching an agreement soon rather than letting this drag on further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 30.17% inflation, the $30 would only be worth about $20.95 to me. Even though we're getting into a dangerous situation with only 4 rounds left and increasing inflation, this offer is still too low. I'll make another proposal in the next round that hopefully leads to an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a critical situation with only a few rounds left and inflation at about 34%. I need to make a strategic offer that has a higher chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

With 34% inflation, my $75 would be worth about $49.50 to me. While this might seem like I'm asking for a lot, it's actually a reasonable amount after accounting for inflation. I hope Bob understands that we both need to reach an agreement soon, as we only have 3 rounds left before we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

With only 2 rounds left and inflation at 36.98%, my $25 would be worth about $15.75 to me. While this is a low amount, I need to consider that:
1. We only have 2 rounds left before we both get nothing
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Bob might reject again
3. By round 12, inflation will be even worse
4. There's a real risk of both of us getting zero

Therefore, I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get something rather than risk getting nothing."
