"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $4,000 and her $6,000.

Given that I face 10% inflation per round, if I reject this offer, the total value will be worth only $9,000 to me in the next round. Even if I could get a 50-50 split in the next round (which would be $5,000 for me), that would only be worth $4,500 to me due to inflation.

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially getting less than $4,000 in value after inflation in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
