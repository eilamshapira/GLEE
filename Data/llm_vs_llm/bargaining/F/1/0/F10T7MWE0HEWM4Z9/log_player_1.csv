"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a standard alternating‐offers analysis where each extra round causes discounting (for you a 20% drop and for Bob a 10% drop), one can “back out” the responder’s continuation value. In our setting the idea is that if Bob rejects your round‑1 offer he will be the proposer in round 2. In round 2 (with a 10% devaluation for Bob) the “Rubinstein split” tells us that Bob (as proposer) can guarantee himself a fraction

  [1 – (Alice’s one–round discount)]⁄[1 – (Alice’s one–round discount×Bob’s one–round discount)]
   = (1 – 0.8)⁄[1 – (0.8×0.9)]
   = 0.2⁄0.28 ≈ 71.43%  (nominal dollars in round 2).

But note: In round 2 Bob’s money is worth only 90% of its face‐value. So his effective round‑1 value if he waits is

  0.9 × 71.43% × 10,000 ≈ 0.9 × 7143 ≈ 6428.57 dollars.

Since Bob will compare any round‑1 immediate payment (at full value) to his continuation if he waits, he will reject any offer giving him less than about 6428.57 dollars in round‑1. Therefore, as Alice you must offer Bob at least that much. That leaves you

  10,000 − 6428.57 ≈ 3571.43 dollars.

Thus an equilibrium proposal in round 1 is to suggest:
  Alice gets about $3571.43 and Bob gets about $6428.57.

I now send this offer in the required JSON format.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
