"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome. This seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Original value: $4750
Inflation reduction (10%): $4750 * 0.9 = $4275

Since Bob's offer gives me $4275, which is less than half of the original amount ($5000), I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me (10% per round) and 10% less for Bob (5% per round).

My offer for Round 3:

Original value for me: $10,000 * 0.8 = $8000 (due to 20% inflation reduction)
I'll offer Bob a bit more than half of the original value, taking into account the inflation difference:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground. This offer should be more appealing to both of us.""}"
