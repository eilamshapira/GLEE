"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Given that Alice's money loses 5% value each round while mine maintains its value:
- If we go to the next round, Alice's $5000 would only be worth $4750 to her
- This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round
- I could potentially offer a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the time pressure she faces

Since I don't lose value over time and Alice does, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, I can leverage this to propose a split that favors me slightly more while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept (since rejecting would mean her share loses another 5% value in the next round).

If Alice rejects my offer, her portion would be worth another 5% less in round 3, so she has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This gives Alice $4000 now, which is better than potentially getting less value in the next round due to the 5% depreciation. It's a significant enough improvement for me over the initial 50-50 split while still being fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5250, which is better than her initial offer of $5000
2. If I reject:
   - I could propose in round 4
   - But Alice's share would lose another 5% value
   - She might become more aggressive in negotiations
3. This offer gives me a reasonable improvement over the initial 50-50 split
4. The difference between this and my previous proposal ($6000 for me) might not be worth the risk of continued negotiation

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, this offer represents a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's a meaningful improvement over the initial offer, and there's risk in pushing too hard.
