"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. This is a 50-50 split which might seem fair at first glance
2. However, we have different inflation rates (10% for me vs 20% for Alice)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where:
   - My 10% inflation means the money is worth 90% of original value
   - Her 20% inflation means the money is worth 80% of original value
4. This difference in inflation rates gives me negotiating leverage

Given this, I'll reject the 50-50 split and make a counter-offer next round that takes advantage of our different inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation rates, I'll propose a split that takes advantage of our different positions while still being reasonable enough for Alice to potentially accept.

Since Alice's money devalues faster (20% per round vs my 10%), she has more incentive to accept sooner. However, if I'm too greedy, she might reject and we could both lose value through multiple rounds.

Let me propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me a better share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount that's worth more now than it would be in future rounds due to her higher inflation rate."
