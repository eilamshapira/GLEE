53.0,47.0,"Hi Alice, my proposal for this round is a $47/$53 split in my favor. Given that with each round the value decreases (0.9 times for me and 0.8 times for you), this division ensures that our effective values remain nearly equal. I believe this fair proposal accounts for the inflation weâ€™re both facing. Let me know if you agree!",Bob,2,
