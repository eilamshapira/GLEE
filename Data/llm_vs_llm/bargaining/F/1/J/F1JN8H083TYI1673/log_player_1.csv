"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose a 70/30 split in my favor for this round. It's early in the game, and the potential loss due to inflation isn't significant yet. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, my proposal for this round is a $47/$53 split in my favor. Given that with each round the value decreases (0.9 times for me and 0.8 times for you), this division ensures that our effective values remain nearly equal. I believe this fair proposal accounts for the inflation weâ€™re both facing. Let me know if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
