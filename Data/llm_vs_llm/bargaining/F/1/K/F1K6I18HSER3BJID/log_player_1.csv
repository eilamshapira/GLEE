"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that you have a higher inflation rate and would benefit from accepting sooner rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's better for both of us to settle sooner, but I need a bit more to compensate for my higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, my $450,000 is worth $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth even less
3. Bob's higher inflation rate (10%) means he's more pressured to settle soon
4. However, the current split is reasonably fair given the circumstances
