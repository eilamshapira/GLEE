"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very unbalanced offer that heavily favors Bob. Even with the 20% inflation, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob made an extreme offer, I'll propose a more balanced split while accounting for the 20% inflation (we're now at 80% of original value).

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is completely fair to both parties, and considering the inflation, we should try to reach an agreement soon. A 50-50 split shows I'm willing to be reasonable and cooperative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 37 
# Bob gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal for me, we're already in round 4 and the money has lost almost half its value. If we continue negotiating, further inflation will reduce the real value even more. Bob's offer, while favoring him, is not extremely unfair, and it's better to secure this amount now than risk further depreciation."
