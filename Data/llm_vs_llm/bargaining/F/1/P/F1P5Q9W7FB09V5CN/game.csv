2101.41,7898.59,"Hi Bob, I propose we end the game now: you get $7898.59 and I get $2101.41. Given the devaluation in later rounds, this split reflects our future bargaining power â€“ if you hold out, the margin is less favorable for both of us. I hope you agree to settle now and avoid unnecessary value loss.",Alice,1,
