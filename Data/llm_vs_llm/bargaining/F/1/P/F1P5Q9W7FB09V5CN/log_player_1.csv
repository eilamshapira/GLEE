Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2101.41, ""bob_gain"": 7898.59, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we end the game now: you get $7,898.59 and I get $2,101.41. Given the devaluation in later rounds, this split reflects our future bargaining power â€“ if you hold out, the margin is less favorable for both of us. I hope you agree to settle now and avoid unnecessary value loss.""}"
