"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we end the game now: you get $7898.59 and I get $2101.41. Given the devaluation in later rounds, this split reflects our future bargaining power â€“ if you hold out, the margin is less favorable for both of us. I hope you agree to settle now and avoid unnecessary value loss. 
# Bob gain: 7898.59 
# Alice gain: 2101.41 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
