"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while accounting for the first-mover advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a fair 50-50 split, and with inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further value loss in subsequent rounds.
