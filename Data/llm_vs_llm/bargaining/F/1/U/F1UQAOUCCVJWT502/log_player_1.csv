"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $35, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $31.50 to me
2. If I reject, we'll go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but any money I get will be worth 20% less
3. We still have 10 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing for me with each round
4. $31.50 is significantly less than my initial proposal of $60, but waiting longer will only reduce the value further
