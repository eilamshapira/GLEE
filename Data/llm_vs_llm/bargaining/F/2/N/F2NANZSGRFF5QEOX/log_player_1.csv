Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. 45 dollars is the least I'm willing to accept. The value keeps shrinking, let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $45 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:** The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller payout.
* **Unknown Factor:**  We don't know how inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the money. He might be more resistant to accepting a lower offer in later rounds.
* **Better Than Nothing:** Accepting $45 is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing if the game continues and the money's value plummets further."
