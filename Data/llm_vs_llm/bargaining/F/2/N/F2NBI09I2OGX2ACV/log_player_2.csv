"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me 4000$ out of 10,000$. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would only be worth 9500$ from my perspective.

If I reject, I could offer a more favorable split next round, but Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation.

With the current offer, I'm getting 4000$ which is 40% of the total. While not ideal, accepting now guarantees this amount without risking further depreciation.
