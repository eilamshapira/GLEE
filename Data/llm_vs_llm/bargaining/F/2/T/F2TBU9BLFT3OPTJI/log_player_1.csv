"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that inflation will affect my gains more severely (10% vs 5% for Bob), I should make a reasonable first offer to avoid multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly due to the inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 × 0.9 = $405,000 (after 10% inflation)
   * Bob gets $550,000 × 0.95 = $522,500 (after 5% inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation (20% for me, 10% for Bob)
   * I would need to make a new offer
   * Any delays further reduce the value for both of us
   * Even if I make a better split next round, the inflation will eat into my gains

Given that waiting another round would mean significant value loss, and this offer gives me a reasonable share, I should accept.
