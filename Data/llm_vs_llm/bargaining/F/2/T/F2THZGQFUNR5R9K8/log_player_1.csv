"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. As Alice, I want to maximize my gain, but I also want to ensure Bob accepts the offer to avoid getting nothing after 12 rounds. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting offer. While I initially proposed a slightly better split for myself, getting $500,000 in round 2 is still a very good outcome. If I reject, I risk a worse offer in the future. To avoid prolonging the negotiation and potentially getting nothing, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
