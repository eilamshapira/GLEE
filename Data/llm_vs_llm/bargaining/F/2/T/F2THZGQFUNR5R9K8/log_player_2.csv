"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While it's not an even split, it's quite reasonable - I'd get 450,000$ which is 45% of the total. Since we have many rounds left, I could reject and counter-offer, but there's also risk in prolonging negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that's more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the million dollars equally - 500,000$ each. This is the fairest division and gives both of us a substantial amount."
