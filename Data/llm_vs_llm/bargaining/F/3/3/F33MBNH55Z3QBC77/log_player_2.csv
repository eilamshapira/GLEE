"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. Since we have 12 rounds, I have the option to counter-offer if I reject. However, if we run through all rounds without agreement, we both get nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a slightly more balanced counter-offer while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. A 50/50 split is the fairest division and allows us both to walk away with the same amount. This is the most equitable solution."
