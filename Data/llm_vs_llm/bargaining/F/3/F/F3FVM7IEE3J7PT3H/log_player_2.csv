"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: you receive the entire $10000 and I take nothing. Although it may feel unbalanced, every round of delay costs me 10% of my potential value while you’re unaffected. Accepting now gives you the full amount, which is exactly what you can secure for yourself if you wait. I hope we can agree quickly to avoid any unnecessary loss on my end. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
