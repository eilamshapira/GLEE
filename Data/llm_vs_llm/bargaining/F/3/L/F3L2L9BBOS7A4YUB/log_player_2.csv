"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate further if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer gives me $40
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less
   - $40 now is better than $44.44 in next round (because of 10% inflation)
3. The offer isn't great (40/60 split), but considering inflation, negotiating might leave me worse off
