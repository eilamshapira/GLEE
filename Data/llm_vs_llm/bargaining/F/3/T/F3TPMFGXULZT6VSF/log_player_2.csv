"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and 5% less for Alice, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

For Round 2, the total amount is effectively:
- For me (Bob): $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000
- For Alice: $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000

However, the actual division is based on the original $1,000,000. I'll aim for a fair split considering the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value for me (Bob) is 81% of the original (100% - 19%), and for Alice, it's 90.25% of the original (100% - 9.75%).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain: $350,000 * 0.81 = $283,500 (in real value)
- Alice's gain: $650,000 * 0.9025 = $586,625 (in real value)

This offer seems to favor Alice significantly. I'll reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, despite the further decrease in value.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth:
- For me (Bob): $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $729,000 (since it decreases by 10% each round, and we're in the 4th round)
- For Alice: $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $857,375 (since it decreases by 5% each round, and we're in the 4th round)

However, the actual division is based on the original $1,000,000. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, I'll aim for a split that reflects our relative losses.
