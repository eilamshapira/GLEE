"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice's decision-making
4. A fair split in the first round eliminates any risk

Since this is a fair offer and there's no benefit in prolonging the negotiation, I should accept.
