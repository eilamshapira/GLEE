Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that my share remains fully valuable while we face uncertainty over potential inflation on your end, I believe this division reflects our differing positions. I propose that I receive $800000 and you receive $200000. Let's settle now before further delays complicate matters.

# Bob gain: 800000

This takes into account the 20% inflation I'm experiencing on my gains and still leaves you with a substantial amount. This is a much fairer compromise. Let's end the game here.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that your share is discounted by 36% from round 1 onward and that if you reject this offer you’ll become the proposer next round—letting you secure almost the entire nominal pie (which translates to up to ~$640000 effective value)—I realize my bargaining power here is limited. To avoid any further delay (and the risk that future rounds might not improve your effective outcome), I'm offering you the full $1000000 now. I hope you accept this final offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0
