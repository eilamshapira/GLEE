"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair offer, let's settle this now before inflation hits!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, given that my share remains fully valuable while we face uncertainty over potential inflation on your end, I believe this division reflects our differing positions. I propose that I receive $800,000 and you receive $200,000. Let's settle now before further delays complicate matters.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation affecting me. However, your offer was far too skewed. I'm proposing a 70/30 split. This takes into account the 20% inflation I'm experiencing on my gains and still leaves you with a substantial amount. This is a much fairer compromise. Let's end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 0, ""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that your share is discounted by 36% from round 1 onward and that if you reject this offer you’ll become the proposer next round—letting you secure almost the entire nominal pie (which translates to up to ~$640,000 effective value)—I realize my bargaining power here is limited. To avoid any further delay (and the risk that future rounds might not improve your effective outcome), I'm offering you the full $1,000,000 now. I hope you accept this final offer.""}"
