"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Let's conclude this now before inflation affects us further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $500,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $450,000 for me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, the money will be worth even less (20% less)
* Bob is offering an equal split, but due to inflation, it's actually disadvantageous for me
* Making a new offer might lead to further rejections and more value loss

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and while this split appears equal on paper, it actually favors Bob due to inflation. However, continuing would likely lead to even worse outcomes for me due to increasing inflation penalties."
