"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically:

1. The offer is reasonably fair, with a 45-55 split
2. I know I don't lose value to inflation, but:
   - Alice might lose value in future rounds
   - She doesn't know that inflation doesn't affect me
3. I could potentially get more by rejecting and making my own offer
4. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds

Given that I don't lose value to inflation, I can afford to be strategic and reject this offer to potentially get a better deal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I know I'm not affected by inflation but Alice likely thinks I am, I'll propose a more balanced split while emphasizing urgency to make it appealing.
