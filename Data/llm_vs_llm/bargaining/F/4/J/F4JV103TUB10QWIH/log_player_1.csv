"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but I'm aiming for something more equitable. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* Due to 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's $45 offer now, it's actually worth $36 (45 * 0.8) to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 20% less
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, leading to further devaluation
* Bob's position seems stronger since inflation doesn't affect him

While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me. I should probably accept now before my share devalues further.
