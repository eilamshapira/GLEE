"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While she calls it a ""fair share,"" the division isn't equal. Since this is the first round, I should consider whether I might get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round.
