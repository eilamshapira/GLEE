"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
3. If I make a counter-offer next round, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000
4. My $400,000 right now is better than a potential larger share of a depreciated amount
5. This is a reasonable first offer - not too greedy

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and the possibility of failed negotiations makes this offer acceptable.
