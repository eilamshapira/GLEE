"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts, and with inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's better to settle early. This is a perfectly fair division that benefits us both equally. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair division, and considering that inflation affects the money's value for me by 20% each round, it's reasonable to accept the offer early to maximize my gain.
