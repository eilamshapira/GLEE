"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose I get $525,000 and you get $475,000. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to account for the risk of inflation if negotiations extend to another round."
