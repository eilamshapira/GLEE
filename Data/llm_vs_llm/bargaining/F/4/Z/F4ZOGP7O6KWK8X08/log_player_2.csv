"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $475,000 out of $1,000,000 (47.5%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me in the next round
4. $475,000 now is better than a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. The split is relatively fair (close to 50-50)
6. If negotiations drag on, we both lose value

Given these factors, particularly the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer. It's reasonably fair, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes it unwise to reject.
