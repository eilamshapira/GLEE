"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. So $10,000 in the next round is effectively worth $9,500 to me.

Alice's current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject and aim for more in the next round, I need to consider that I'll lose 5% of whatever amount I get. For example, even if I managed to get $5,000 in the next round, it would actually be worth $4,750 to me due to inflation.

Given that Alice opened with a 40/60 split, which isn't terrible, and considering the inflation penalty I face, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
