"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'll start by offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can finish quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I can likely get a better deal in the next round. Inflation is working against me, but I still have time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'll try to split the difference from the last offer. I believe a 70/30 split is more reasonable, and hopefully, Bob will be more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even with the inflation, I believe I can do better.  I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than the previous round. I believe this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be more receptive."
