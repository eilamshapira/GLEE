"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  A fair deal to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer gives me a substantial amount of $40, I need to consider that if I reject, I'll make a counteroffer but face 10% inflation, meaning the total value will be only $90 to me in the next round. Since $40 is a significant portion, and inflation will reduce my potential gains if we continue negotiating, I'll accept this initial offer.
