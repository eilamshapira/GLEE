Bob's offer:

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I've received Bob's offer for Round 4. The money I receive is worth significantly less now due to inflation.

Let's analyze the offer:

*   **Alice's gain:** $320,000.
*   **Inflation adjustment:** The money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round. Therefore the value of the Alice gain is $320000 * (1 - 0.488) = 164000

Considering the effective value and that the game will keep going, it's beneficial to take the offer now.
