"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer given the inflation rates. 

In this offer, I would get $50 and Alice would get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases - for me by 10% and for Alice by 20%.

If I reject and proceed to round 2:
- The $100 would be worth $90 to me and only $80 to Alice
- This means I could potentially offer a split that gives me more than $50

However, Alice is offering a perfectly equal split in the first round, which is fair. The inflation penalty would only reduce the total value for both of us if we continue negotiating.
