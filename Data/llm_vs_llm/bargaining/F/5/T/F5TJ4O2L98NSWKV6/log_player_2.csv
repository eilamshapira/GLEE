"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me less. This way, we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so she considers $9,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $10,000 and split it in a way that accounts for the inflation difference.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. This offer should be fair considering the different inflation rates affecting us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value to me (100% - 20% - 20% = 60% after two rounds, but since it's 36% less than the original after two rounds of rejection, I calculate it as 100% * (1 - 0.20)^2 = 64% is incorrect, the correct calculation is 100% * 0.8 * 0.8 = 64%, but the problem states it's 36% less after two rounds of rejection for me, so the actual value I consider is 100% - 36% = 64% of the original $10,000, which is $6,400. For Alice, it's worth 81% of its original value (100% - 19% = 81% after two rounds of rejection, so $8,100).

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $10,000 and split it in a way that accounts for the inflation difference.
