"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I should aim for a favorable first offer while keeping it acceptable enough for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's advantageous to me while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. If he declines, his counter-offer would be worth 20% less to me, and my counter-offer to his would be worth 5% less to him, so there's incentive for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $450,000 is now worth effectively $360,000 to me (450000 * 0.8)
2. In my initial offer, I would have gotten $600,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth another 20% less to me (so only 64% of original value)
- It will be worth 90.25% of original value to Bob (0.95^2)
- This significantly reduces my negotiating power

Given these factors, while this offer is less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now rather than continue negotiating. Further rounds would erode my purchasing power more significantly than Bob's.
