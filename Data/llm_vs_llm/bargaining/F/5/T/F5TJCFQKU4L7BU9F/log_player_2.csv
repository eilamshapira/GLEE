"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept or reject Alice's offer. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $600,000.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money loses 5% value for me
- The money loses 20% value for Alice
- I get to make the next proposal

If I reject, the total value becomes $950,000 for me and $800,000 for Alice in the next round. This gives me negotiating leverage since the money depreciates more quickly for Alice.

Given these considerations, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since the money depreciates faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I have some negotiating leverage, but I still want to make an offer that Alice will accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives Alice a significant portion while recognizing my advantage in the negotiation due to the different inflation rates. If we continue to further rounds, both of us will lose more value, so this is a mutually beneficial solution."
