"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. While I understand your concern about inflation, we both face the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. A fair split gives us both substantial gains and avoids further rounds of negotiation where the value decreases for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
