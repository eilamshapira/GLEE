"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000. 

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less due to inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. If I could get more than $400,000 of that $900,000 in the next round, it might be worth rejecting.

However, there's risk in rejection - Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation, and we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even with the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation risk we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. While I understand your concern about inflation, we both face the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. A fair split gives us both substantial gains and avoids further rounds of negotiation where the value decreases for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This way, we both get a fair share while considering my inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $450,000 and herself $550,000.

Considering the inflation information I just received:
- My money is now worth 19% less than in round 1
- Alice's money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1

This means the $450,000 offered to me is actually worth about $364,500 after accounting for my inflation (450,000 Ã— 0.81).

If I reject and we go to the next round, my inflation will increase further. Also, I notice Alice's inflation rate is about half of mine (9.75% vs 19%), giving her a negotiating advantage as we progress through more rounds.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and my money loses value faster than Alice's, this improved offer of 55-45 is reasonable.
