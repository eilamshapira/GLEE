"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it equally at 50-50. That way, we both win fairly and quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, any future negotiations will be affected by increasing inflation for Bob
3. Getting $5000 now with no inflation impact for me is better than risking further rounds
4. Bob's proposal is reasonable and shows willingness to cooperate"
