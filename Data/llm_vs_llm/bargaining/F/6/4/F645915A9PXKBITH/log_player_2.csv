"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She offers me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, we move to next round where I can make an offer
- However, due to 20% inflation, $100 will be worth $80 in the next round
- So even if I got 100% in next round, I'd only get equivalent of $80
- Current offer of $40 is better than risking delay with inflation
