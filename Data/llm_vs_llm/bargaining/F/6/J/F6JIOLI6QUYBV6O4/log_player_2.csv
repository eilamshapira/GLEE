"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly and both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. That's a fair offer that matches what many would consider an equitable division.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $9,000, meaning even if I tried to get more in the next round, we'd be dividing a smaller pie. While I could potentially get more than $5,000 in the next round, there's also risk in prolonging the negotiation.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and accepting now maximizes our combined outcome, I'll accept.
