"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer in this money division game.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest this division where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This gives you a substantial amount while recognizing that I face a 10% inflation penalty with each passing round, which puts pressure on me to reach an agreement sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to you while still accounting for the inflation penalty I face. With each round, the money becomes worth less to me, so I'm proposing a fair division that gives you a significant portion while allowing us to reach an agreement before further inflation impacts occur."
