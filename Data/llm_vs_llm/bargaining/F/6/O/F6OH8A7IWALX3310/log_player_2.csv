"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less
   * $100 * 0.95 = $95 total value next round
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
   * Further rounds mean even more value loss

While 40/60 isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of Alice rejecting my counter-offer, it might be better to accept now rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
